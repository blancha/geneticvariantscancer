122||The RNA maturation is an important and complex biological process. It requires several small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that comprise the two forms of spliceosomes. The major form of spliceosome (U2-type) is composed of U1, U2, U4/6 and U5 snRNPs, and catalyzes most splicing events in metazoans.1  Mutations of genes, such as SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent SF1, SF3A1, U2AF2 or PRPF40B, encoding spliceosome compounds have been found to occur at high frequencies in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).2, 3, 4 Subsequently, SF3B1 mutations were also found in solid tumors such as endometrial, lung, bladder, pancreatic and breast carcinomas and cutaneous melanomas.5 We and others also reported that 15–20% of uveal melanoma (UM) carry SF3B1 mutations.6, 7, 8 SF3B1 (splicing factor 3 B subunit 1, also named SF3B155) is a central compound the U2 snRNP complex in direct contact with the branch site of the pre-mRNA. SF3B1 contains 22 HEAT repeats (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, Targets of rapamycin 1). Major hotspots of missense mutations of SF3B1 target one of the HEAT repeats at positions R625, K666 and K700, with variability according to diseases, R625 and K700 mutations being the most prevalent in UM and hematologic disorders, respectively. Prognosis value of these mutations vary according to diseases, SF3B1 mutations are associated with poor outcomes in CLL and favorable outcomes in UM.9 SF3B1 mutations are especially associated with the refractory anemia with excess of ring sideroblasts (RARS), a mild form of MDS with little impact on patient’s survival. Consequences of these mutations on splicing are less clear. Aberrant splicing associated with SF3B1 was reported by two landmark publications.2, 3 However, little overlap was found between MDS and CLL. Furthermore, Harbour et al.6 found no splicing effect of SF3B1 mutations in a series of UM patients analyzed by RNA-seq. By combining exon array and RNA-seq analyzes, we recently reported alternative transcripts of eight genes statistically associated with SF3B1 R625 mutations and linked to various RNA processing mechanisms: alternative terminal exons (UQCC, ADAM12, GAS8), alternative 3′ acceptor splice sites (CRNDE, ANKHD1), alternative cassette exons (GUSBP1), alternative first exon (F8) and intron retention (ABCC5).7  Five of these differential splicing events (CRNDE, GUSBP11, UQCC, ABCC5 and ANKHD1) were most consistently associated with the SF3B1-mutated status. Here we explored whether this splicing signature was also associated with SF3B1 mutations in malignancies other than UM, namely in MDS and CLL.  Series of CLL (26 cases), MDS of various subtypes (48 cases) and UM (87 cases) were assembled. These samples were genotyped for the recurrent mutated genes of the spliceosome, and biological and clinical data were obtained (see Supplementary Table for sample characteristics). After RNA extraction and reverse transcription, samples were analyzed for the two splice forms of UQCC, CRNDE, ANKHD1, GUSBP1 and ABCC5 by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) as described previously.7 CRNDE was poorly expressed in CLL, below the detection sensitivity of the RT-QPCR in most cases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied on the splicing ratio of the five expressed genes obtained for the series of MDS and CLL data, as well as with that of the series of UM previously reported.7 Whereas no disease aggregation was observed in the clustering, all SF3B1-mutated samples clustered in a single branch (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table for complete sample status). More specifically, this group of samples included 8 CLL SF3B1-mutated samples (K700E (6), K666T (1) and G742D (1)), 24 MDS SF3B1-mutated sample cases (K700E (14), H622Q (4), D781G (2), R625L/H/D/C (4)) and 19 SF3B1-mutated UM samples (R625H/C/L/P (16), K666M/T (2), K700E (1)). As expected, most SF3B1-mutated MDS were classified as RARS or refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (16 and 4, respectively out of 23 cases). No SF3B1-mutated samples were misclassified, except one MDS sample, MDS44 and one UM case, UM48, with low but detectable frequencies of mutated SF3B1 allele, which segregated with wild-type cases. Five cases without detected splicesome mutations (one MDS, two UM and two CLL) clustered in this branch corresponding to the mutated samples. The three SRSF2-mutated MDS cases, bearing the P95H hotspot mutation, segregated in the second branch with the wild-type samples, suggesting that this mutant-splicing factor differently affects the splicing process than the SF3B1 mutants. Two MDS samples bearing ZRSR2 missense mutations of unknown functional consequences (K413E and V304M) segregated each in a different branch.  Figure 1.

An unsupervised hierarchical clustering and a heatmap are performed using the difference in Ct (threshold cycle) between the two splicing forms expression for the five genes, measured by RT-QPCR for a series of 161 tumor samples representing 3 pathologies: uveal melanoma (UM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Data were normalized on mean and standard deviation within each pathology and research center. Clustering was performed based on Euclidian distance by Ward’s method.

NA, not available.  Full figure and legend (124K)  Several conclusions could be drawn from these results. First, it is the first time that consistent splicing abnormalities are associated with SF3B1 mutations. The fact that the same splicing pattern is observed in tumor cells from different lineages and embryonic origins, strongly argues for a direct consequence of SF3B1 mutation. Second, the same pattern is observed irrespective of the mutated HEAT repeats of SF3B1. The reason for different hotspot mutations in different malignancies is largely unexplained but no different consequence was detected in the limited splicing events explored here. Third, the other mutated spliceosome compounds present in our series, including SRSF2 and ZRSR2, did not share the splicing abnormalities of the SF3B1 mutants. Finally, while no false negative was present in the clustering, the splicing pattern of 5 out of 161 samples from the three series was undistinguishable from that of SF3B1 samples, suggesting either experimental limitation of our splicing analysis or undetected abnormalities of the splicing machinery.  Our data clearly associate specific splicing abnormalities to SF3B1 mutations but these abnormalities are most probably not limited to those analyzed here. To statistically demonstrate splicing variants among more than 200 000 different splicing events remains challenging. It requires reliable molecular tools such as the latest generation of exon array or RNA-seq, efficient bioinformatics and large series of cases. It is thus likely that only the most consistent events were picked by the analysis of a limited number of mutated cases. Splicing forms yet to be discovered may better explain the oncogenic pathways activated by mutant SF3B1. Finally, our results do not rule out functions of SF3B1 besides splicing, which deregulations could intervene in oncogenesis.   Graphical Abstract Image for unlabelled figure Figure options  Introduction RNA splicing, a highly regulated molecular event orchestrated by the spliceosome, involves the removal of intronic sequences from pre-mRNA and the ligation of exons to generate mature mRNA (Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009). This process can result in multiple mRNAs being produced from a single gene providing increased protein diversity in cells. Dysregulation of RNA splicing has been identified as a causative defect in several diseases (Dehm, 2013 ;  Singh and Cooper, 2012). Furthermore, dysregulated alternative splicing has been proposed to play an important role in tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy; however, in many cases, the molecular consequences of dysregulated splicing in cancer have remained largely elusive (Zhang and Manley, 2013). Recently, recurrent heterozygous mutations were identified in components of the spliceosome in various tumor types suggesting that somatic mutations in spliceosome genes play an important role in cancer (Yoshida and Ogawa, 2014). SF3B1 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene with particular enrichment in diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, uveal melanoma (UVM), skin melanoma (SKCM), and breast (BRCA) and pancreatic cancers ( Biankin et al., 2012; Ellis et al., 2012; Harbour et al., 2013; Kong et al., 2014; Landau et al., 2013; Malcovati et al., 2015 ;  Yoshida et al., 2011). Based on the high frequency of SF3B1 mutations and the key role in splicing of this protein, we sought to study the molecular and functional consequences of SF3B1 hotspot mutations on RNA splicing in cell lines and patient samples.  Splicing takes place after the recognition of consensus sequences near the 5′ and 3′ ends of introns, known as 5′ and 3′ splice sites (ss), by the splicing machinery. U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) recognizes the 5′ ss, whereas U2 snRNP is directed to the appropriate 3′ ss by short, conserved pre-mRNA sequences, including a branch point sequence (BPS), the polypyrimidine (Py) tract, and the AG dinucleotide at the intron-exon junction. Prior to U2 snRNP recruitment, SF1 recognizes the BPS, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) large subunit (U2AF2) recognizes the Py tract, and U2AF small subunit (U2AF1) recognizes the AG dinucleotide. Subsequently, the U2 snRNP replaces SF1 in an ATP-dependent process that facilitates protein and RNA rearrangements. In particular, the N terminus of SF3B1, a U2 snRNP component, has been shown to bind with U2AF2, whereas the SF3B1 C terminus along with another U2 snRNP component, p14, interacts with the BPS and nearby pre-mRNA sequences (Gozani et al., 1998). In addition, U2 snRNP and pre-mRNA complex is stabilized by a base-paired duplex between the U2 snRNA and the BPS. The subsequent binding of U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP induces structural rearrangements that lead to activation of two catalytic steps that generate the lariat intermediate and subsequent final exon-exon product (Horowitz, 2012; Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009).  The recurrent hotspot mutations in SF3B1 are found exclusively in the C-terminal HEAT domains (residues 622–781; Figure S1A). Though there has been lack of structural information on how SF3B1 interacts with pre-mRNA, previous cryo-electron microscopy studies suggest that SF3B1 may undergo a conformational change to a more open form that enables mRNA binding and BPS recognition by the U2 snRNP (Golas et al., 2003). Although it was previously reported by several groups that SF3B1 mutant-positive cancers are associated with aberrant splicing (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013), here, we show that SF3B1 hotspot mutations (SF3B1MUT) result in neomorphic activity causing aberrant splicing. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ ss selection through the use of a branch point (BP) different from the BP utilized by SF3B1 wild-type (SF3B1WT) and that SF3B1MUT still requires the canonical Py tract for the formation of the active spliceosome to induce aberrant splicing. We predict that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced mRNAs are subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that multiple aberrant transcripts are degraded, resulting in downregulation of the associated canonical protein in cell line models and patient samples. These insights into the splicing aberrations induced by SF3B1MUT will enable discovery of downstream consequences that contribute to neoplasms and the discovery of targeted therapeutic approaches for SF3B1MUT cancers.  Results SF3B1MUT Tumor-Specific Splicing Defects  To provide a more complete understanding of the splicing aberrations observed in SF3B1MUT cancers, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from different tumor types were analyzed using a bioinformatic pipeline that we developed in order to quantify exon-exon junctions without the need of predetermined alternative splicing models or annotated splice junctions. The analysis pipeline was applied to CLL patient samples (7 SF3B1MUT and 6 SF3B1WT) and a number of samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas: luminal A primary BRCA (7 SF3B1K700E and 14 SF3B1WT), SKCM (3 SF3B1MUT and 12 SF3B1WT), and UVM (18 SF3B1MUT and 18 SF3B1WT) (Table S1). This analysis revealed 895 aberrant splice junctions to be significantly upregulated in SF3B1MUT compared to SF3B1WT of which 534 events (∼60%) were unique as they had not been previously annotated in major transcriptome databases. The majority of aberrant splicing events observed were aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures 1A and S1B; Table S2), consistent with previous observations (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013).

Box plots and whiskers are represented as per the Tukey method. See also Figure S1 and Tables S2 and S3. Figure options Unsupervised clustering was applied to the identified aberrant junctions and it led to clustering of SF3B1MUT samples distinct from the cluster of SF3B1WT samples (Figure 1B), with the exception of two SF3B1MUT samples (TCGA-D8-A1JH and TCGA-ER-A19S) that clustered with the SF3B1WT samples. This was likely driven by low mutant allele fractions (7% and 14%, respectively) when compared with a range of 25%–52% for other samples (Figure 1B; Table S2). Moreover, samples with SF3B1MUT clustered within each tumor type (BRCA, SKCM, UVM, and CLL), each showing a set of unique aberrantly spliced junctions (Figures 1B and S1C). A set of “common” events (i.e., events found in all tumor types) were observed, consistent with a small overlap of splicing abnormalities found in CLL and UVM described in two previous reports (Furney et al., 2013). The pattern of tumor-specific splicing in BRCA and CLL could, at least in part, be explained by the increased expression of the genes that are aberrantly spliced in these tumor types compared to the other diseases (p = 7.5022 × 10−05 and p = 1.0078 × 10−36, respectively); however, the same was not observed for SKCM and UVM (Figure 1C; Table S3). This suggests that additional mechanisms, such as tissue-specific splicing regulation, might contribute to these patterns.  Using the aberrant junctions identified in the previous analysis, we extended the clustering analysis to include 14 MDS RARS samples (12 SF3B1MUT) and an additional 19 samples from TCGA with miscellaneous SF3B1 mutations (Table S1). For the MDS samples, relatively low sequencing depth and inclusion of just two SF3B1WT samples precluded their use for the discovery of MDS-specific aberrant junctions. While all SF3B1MUT MDS patients and three BRCA patients (p.N626D, p.D781E, and p.K666E) clustered with the original SF3B1MUT sample set, 16 SF3B1 mutant patients clustered with SF3B1WT samples (Figure S1D). These patient samples carried mutations in SF3B1 (“Non-hotspot” in Figure S1D and Table S1) that are not co-localized with the hotspot mutations in the HEAT domain. These analyses strongly suggest a convergence of mechanism and downstream splicing effects induced by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1 Mutations Induce Aberrant mRNA Splicing in Human and Mouse Cells  To study SF3B1MUT in vitro, a pancreatic cancer cell line carrying endogenous SF3B1 mutations (Panc05.04: p.Q699H and p.K700E) was utilized. In addition, the p.K700E, p.K666N, or p.H662Q mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E, Nalm-6 SF3B1K666N, Nalm-6 SF3B1H662Q) or a synonymous mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700K, referred as SF3B1WT) was introduced by AAV-mediated homology to the Nalm-6 pre-B cell line to produce isogenic matched cell lines. Unsupervised clustering of these cell lines and a panel of several SF3B1WT pancreatic cancer cell lines using the aberrant splice junctions identified in patient samples resulted in clear segregation of SF3B1MUT cell lines from SF3B1WT cells (Figure 2A). A similar increase in aberrant splice junctions observed in RNA-seq data analysis was confirmed in Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells using a Nanostring assay developed to quantify aberrant splice junctions (Figure S2A). Panc05.04 cells carry the hotspot mutation p.K700E and a mutation at position 699 (p.Q699H) that is not observed in patient samples. When the p.Q699H and p.K700E were expressed alone or in combination in 293FT cells, only cells expressing p.K700E and p.Q699H/p.K700E induced aberrant splicing indicating that p.Q699H does not appear to affect this aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures S2B and S2C). These data confirm that Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1MUT cell lines are representative models to study the splicing functional activity of SF3B1MUT in vitro.

Data are represented as mean of three biological replicates. Data are presented in box plots as boxes in the first and third quartiles, midline as the median, and whiskers extending to the range excluding outliers. See also Figure S2. Figure options To confirm that additional cancer-associated SF3B1 hotspot mutations induced aberrant splicing, we expressed various mxSF3B1MUT, mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R in 293FT cells (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for a description of mxSF3B1; Figure S2D) and analyzed splicing aberrations by Nanostring. The p.K700R mutation served as a negative control as it doesn’t introduce a major change in charge or size of the amino acid and is not disease associated. All SF3B1MUT tested demonstrated the same usage of aberrant splice sites observed in endogenous and engineered cell lines; however, the SF3B1K700R or SF3B1WT did not show these splicing changes (Figure 2B). Moreover, the expression of any of the SF3B1 constructs did not change the overall expression (sum of aberrant and canonical) of affected genes (Figure 2B). To further confirm the correlation between expression of SF3B1 p.K700E mutation and aberrant splicing, tetracycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to selectively knockdown (KD) the SF3B1MUT or SF3B1WT allele in Panc05.04 and Panc10.05 (SF3B1MUT and SF3B1WT cells). After confirmation of KD efficiency (Figures S2E–S2H), RNA isolated from treated cells was analyzed by Nanostring. Depletion of the SF3B1MUT allele in Panc05.04 resulted in downregulation of aberrant splice isoforms, whereas an accumulation of aberrant splice isoforms was observed with selective SF3B1WT allele depletion (Figures 2C and 2D), indicating that SF3B1MUT was responsible for the appearance of aberrant splicing. These results were also supported by the expression of a pan shRNA or depletion of SF3B1WT in the Panc10.05 where no effect on aberrant splicing was observed (Figures 2C and 2D). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT acquires a neomorphic function and may also lose wild-type splicing activity. This observation was also supported by the recent paper by Zhou et al. proposing that in a different SF3B1 mutant cell line (ESS1) wild-type SF3B1 was required for survival (Zhou et al., 2015).  SF3B1MUT Recognizes a Cryptic 3′ AG with a Short and Weak Py Tract  The most common splicing abnormality observed in SF3B1MUT cells was the usage of an aberrant 3′ ss. To understand the sequence features and the mechanism by which mutant SF3B1 would induce aberrant splicing, computational analysis of SF3B1MUT patient data and minigene assay validation methods were utilized. First, an enrichment of the cryptic AGs was determined to be located between −15 and −24 nt upstream of the canonical 3′ ss in SF3B1MUT patient samples (Figure 3A). In contrast, the first AG (but not GAG) upstream of a canonical AG in RefSeq showed a much lower density in this region and a wider distribution. Interestingly, the motif sequences associated with the cryptic and canonical AGs showed several different features. Upstream of the canonical AGs, a clear enrichment of pyrimidines was observed in agreement with the presence of a Py tract, whereas the cryptic AGs were associated with a short and weak Py tract and an enrichment of adenines (A) that are possibly important for BPS selection. In contrast, no clear features were associated with the first upstream AGs in RefSeq (Figures 3B and S3). Interestingly, similar features, such as the position of cryptic AG between −15 and −24, the presence of a short and weak Py tract, and an enrichment of As were observed in aberrant 3′ spliced junctions detected in NIH 3T3 mouse cells overexpressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures S4A–S4C). While similar features associated with aberrant splice junction usage were observed in mxSF3B1K700E mouse cells, the overlap of affected junctions observed in human cells was low due to low sequence similarity of introns between species (Figure S4D; Table S4). An exception was observed for the UXS1 gene for which the junction between exon 2 and exon 3 is conserved among different species ( Figure S4E). These data strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant splicing in the presence of competing 3′ ss via a sequence-dependent feature located within the intron and preferentially recognizes cryptic splice sites with weaker Py tract in close proximity to an enrichment of As.

Shown here is a representative ethidium-bromide-stained 2.5% agarose gel of the indicated RT-PCR reactions of mRNA isolated from transfected cells. See also Figures S4 and S5 and Table S4. Figure options To confirm the importance of these specific sequence features, we selected the exon 9/exon 10 junction in ZDHHC16 to develop a minigene as it was observed to be aberrantly spliced among all the SF3B1 hotspot mutant samples analyzed. In addition, several alterations in the cryptic 3′ ss, the length/strength of the Py tracts, and the potential BPS were tested ( Figure S5A). Splicing was assessed by RT-PCR using cDNA prepared from 293FT cells co-transfected with ZDHHC16 minigene and mxSF3B1 plasmid. As expected, when the ZDHHC16 exon 9, intron 9 and exon 10 (E9-I9-E10) minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, only canonical splicing was observed, whereas in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E and all the other hotspot mutations, both canonical and aberrant splicing was detected (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 4 and 5; Figure S5B). Interestingly, once the cryptic AG was removed (E9-I9NoAG-E10), aberrant splicing was not observed even in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that the cryptic AG is necessary for aberrant splicing. To understand whether exonic sequences play a role in aberrant splicing, we looked at the preceding junction in ZDHHC16 (E8-I8-E9). As expected, no aberrant splicing was observed when this minigene was co-transfected with any of the mxSF3B1 constructs (Figure 3D, lanes 10 and 11). Canonical and aberrant splicing was detected when intron 8 between exon 8 and 9 was replaced with intron 9 (E8-I9-E9) in the ZDHHC16 minigene and co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, but not when co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R (Figure 3D, lanes 12 and 13). These results agree with the computational analysis suggesting that the cryptic AG is necessary and the intronic features are sufficient to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  Identification of the 3′ ss occurs during early assembly of the spliceosome, in particular when the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex recognizes the Py tract and AG, and then again when the AG is recognized during the second step of splicing (Horowitz, 2012). To understand if the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is sufficient to recruit the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex, the length/strength of the canonical Py tract was reduced from 19 nt to 10, 6, and 2 nt (PyT 10n, PyT 6n, and PyT 2n, respectively) or the weak and short cryptic Py tract was replaced with a strong Py tract (SELEX) (Figure S5A) (Lim et al., 2011). When the minigene PyT 2n (or PyT 10n and PyT 6n, in Figure S5C) was co-transfected with the mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, the splicing event occurred with selection of a new cryptic 3′ ss within exon 10 positioned 54 nt downstream of the canonical 3′ ss (sequencing data not shown), suggesting that the PyT 2n was not recognized by U2AF complex (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15; Figure S5C). This is in agreement with previous reports suggesting that Py tract length and strength are necessary for the recruitment of U2AF2/U2AF1 to guide splicing to occur at that position (Coolidge et al., 1997). Surprisingly, when the same minigenes were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, similar results were observed and splicing occurred within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15), suggesting that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is not sufficient to recruit the U2AF complex and that the cryptic AG requires the downstream canonical Py tract to induce aberrant splicing. The nucleotide base upstream of the AG dinucleotide has been reported to be critical for U2AF1 interaction in early recognition of 3′ ss and is usually a T/C in consensus sequences (Ilagan et al., 2015). Hence, introduction of a G upstream of the canonical or cryptic AG (−3 T > G or −24 C > G) would potentially abolish their use as a 3′ ss, respectively. When −3 T > G minigene was co-transfected with either mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E constructs, splicing was observed within exon 10, similar to PyT 2n, suggesting again that the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex needs to be recruited at the canonical AG during first step of splicing to allow usage of the cryptic AG by SF3B1MUT (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 16 and 17). Interestingly, when −24 C > G minigene was used, only canonical splicing was observed, even after mxSF3B1K700E expression (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 8 and 9). These data suggest that the −3 position relative to cryptic AG is also important when the cryptic 3′ ss is recognized during the second transesterification reaction of splicing. Moreover, when the short and weak cryptic Py tract was replaced with a SELEX Py tract, the cryptic AG was used as the preferred 3′ ss by cells expressing both mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 18 and 19). Taken together, these data support the notion that the sequence features required by SF3B1MUT-containing U2 snRNP complex are located within the intron and that the cryptic AG and the downstream canonical Py tract are required to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1MUT Utilizes a Different BPS  The computational analysis of motifs near the 3′ ss showed an enrichment of As upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse mutant SF3B1 cells, suggesting the importance of this sequence for the SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 complex. DeBoever and colleagues suggested that these were the BPSs for the mutant and wild-type SF3B1 complexes using a BPS prediction algorithm (DeBoever et al., 2015). Instead, we used the recently mapped BPS data using K562 SF3B1WT cells and overlaid these data with introns in which the aberrant splice junctions were observed in SF3B1MUT cells (Mercer et al., 2015). A total of 151 BPs were mapped among 93 introns; 60 introns have only one identified BP, and another 33 introns contain multiple reported BPs. The distribution of these BPs with respect to the cryptic AG indicated that the majority of BPs overlapped with the A of the cryptic AG or were in close proximity (between 1, cryptic A and −5), but did not coincide with the enrichment of As observed in the motif analysis (Figure 4A). The enrichment of As was observed between −8 and −18 nt upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse cells expressing mutant SF3B1 (Figures 4B and S4C). This suggests that these As could play an important role for SF3B1MUT function. To test this hypothesis, the 3 As located between −33 and −35 were mutated to Gs in the ZDHHC16 minigene (−33 to −35 AAA > GGG; Figure 4C and S5A). When this minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT and mxSF3B1K700R, canonical splicing was observed, suggesting that these As are not part of the BPS for wild-type U2 complex (Figure 4D, lanes 11 and 12). Instead, when the cells were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, canonical splicing was observed without any aberrant splicing, indicating that the three As are probably part of the BPS used by the U2 mutant complex (Figure 4D, lane 12). To identify the BPS used by the U2 wild-type complex, the A at position −26 and −30 alone or together were mutated to G (−26 A > G, −30 A > G and −26, −30 AA > GG; Figure 4C). When the A at position −26 alone or both −26 and −30 were mutated to G and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, splicing was observed within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10), suggesting that this is likely the BPS for SF3B1WT, but not for SF3B1K700E, as canonical and aberrant splicing was observed in these conditions (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10). Interestingly, when the minigene with the A at position −30 alone was mutated to G (Figure 4C and S5A) and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R splicing was observed mostly within exon 10 and when co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, only aberrant splicing was observed (Figure 4D, lanes 7 and 8). As expected, when all the As were mutated to Gs (all A > G, Figures 4C and S5A), each mxSF3B1 construct spliced within exon 10 (Figure 4D, lanes 13 and 14). Additionally, this outcome was confirmed by mapping the two different BPs using nested PCR analysis and sequencing of endogenous ZDHHC16 intron 9 lariat in K562 isogenic cells ( Figure 4E). Unlike in SF3B1WT cells, we observed at least two major templates with different sequences in the SF3B1K700E cells due to a mixed population of SF3B1WT and SF3B1MUT proteins. Through analysis and matching of expected transcript sequences using Mutation Surveyor, we found that −34 A and −30 A were the BPs used for SF3B1K700E and SF3B1WT, respectively. To extend our observation, we also mapped BPs in four additional genes that are aberrantly spliced in presence of SF3B1K700E: TMEM14C (intron 1), SEPT6 (intron 9), DLST (intron 5), and DIP2A (intron 23) ( Table S5). These results prove that the SF3B1 wild-type and mutant-containing U2 complexes are able to use two different BPs.  SF3B1MUT Uses a Different BPS than SF3B1WT(A) Relative positions of mapped BP ...

Figure options Aberrant Transcripts Generated by SF3B1MUT Are Subjected to NMD  Erroneous or aberrant mRNAs that contain a premature termination codon are subjected to NMD to prevent potential deleterious effects of their translation to proteins (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Computational analysis revealed that the majority of cryptic AGs were located upstream of canonical 3′ ss at nucleotide distances that were not multiples of 3 (Figure 5A). This result suggested that the aberrant transcripts would have a higher probability to be out of frame and therefore degraded by NMD. To confirm that predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts were degraded by the NMD pathway, RNA-seq was performed on Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells treated with cycloheximide, a translation inhibitor known to inhibit NMD (Singh et al., 2012). Bioinformatic prediction analysis revealed that 44% of all aberrant mRNAs identified in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cell lines would result in an NMD-sensitive transcript (Rivas et al., 2015) (Figure 5B; Tables S6 and S7). RNA-seq analysis from Nalm-6 isogenic cells demonstrated that NMD-sensitive genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E than Nalm-6 SF3B1WT (p = 1.06 × 10−12), whereas predicted NMD-insensitive genes were expressed at similar levels (Figure 5C). RNA-seq analysis identified 41 predicted NMD-sensitive genes to be both downregulated in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E and to have increased abundance following cycloheximide treatment (Figure 5D; Table S6), suggesting that these aberrant transcripts were degraded by the NMD. In addition, to evaluate if this would result in downregulation of the associated canonical protein, stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) with subsequent mass spectrometry was used to quantify protein levels in Nalm-6 isogenic lines (Oda et al., 1999)· Eleven predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts for which peptides could be detected in Nalm-6 SF3B1WT were selected for evaluation, and ten were found to have decreased peptide counts by at least 2- to 8-fold (e.g., ABCB7, AKAP8L; Figure 6A). Decreased expression of canonical proteins was confirmed by western blot analysis using available antibodies, such as MZB1, PHGDH, and SEPT6 (Figure 6B). Among the downregulated proteins in the SILAC experiment were two proteins of particular interest: MZB1 and ABCB7. MZB1 is a B cell-specific and ER-localized protein implicated in antibody secretion and integrin-mediated cell adhesion (van Anken et al., 2009). As shown in Figure 6C, MZB1 was aberrantly spliced in SF3B1K700E cells and the canonical isoform was clearly downregulated at transcript and protein level (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6D). As shown in Figure 6E, clear downregulation of canonical MZB1 protein level was also observed in four out of five CLL patients with SF3B1MUT, but not in SF3B1WT samples. The result for patient 8 could be explained by the low allele fraction for Y623C (10%), and this was associated with undetectable aberrant splicing for ZDHHC16 and no change in canonical MZB1 when compared with one of the SF3B1WT patients (Figure S6). ABCB7 is a mediator of iron accumulation and erythroid growth and has been reported to be downregulated specifically in an MDS subtype characterized by refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (Boultwood et al., 2008). Interestingly, SF3B1 mutations have been found at a frequency of 80%–90% in RARS, but not in other MDS subtypes (Papaemmanuil et al., 2011). In addition, a partial loss-of-function mutation in ABCB7 has been identified in X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia demonstrating an iron-overload phenotype in cells with defective ABCB7 (Allikmets et al., 1999). We identified that ABCB7 is aberrantly spliced in SF3B1 mutant cells (Figure 6F) and demonstrated that the aberrant transcript is subject to NMD, causing downregulation of the canonical transcript and protein (Figures 6A and 6D). Therefore, aberrant splicing and subsequent NMD of ABCB7 likely explains the association between ABCB7 downregulation observed in RARS and the presence of SF3B1 mutants. Taken together, these data suggest that SF3B1MUT might contribute to the phenotypes observed in diseases by inducing the generation of NMD-sensitive transcripts through aberrant splicing and to a subsequent reduction in the levels of the corresponding proteins.  44% of All Aberrantly Spliced Genes Are Putative Targets of NMD(A) Frequency of ...

See also Figure S6. Figure options Discussion In the current study, we describe the mechanism by which SF3B1 hotspot mutations induce aberrant splicing and the fate of resulting NMD-sensitive aberrant mRNAs in several cancer types. These mutations are associated with the expression of hundreds of aberrantly spliced junctions, mostly by utilizing a cryptic AG. While some aberrant junctions are common across different cancer types, others are tumor specific, which in some cases is a consequence of tissue-specific gene expression; however, additional factors likely contribute to these differences. Interestingly, aberrant splicing was observed only in patients carrying hotspot mutations located in the C-terminal HEAT domains, but not in samples from “non-hotspot” patients, as they clustered with the SF3B1WT patients in aberrant junction usage comparisons. The majority of these non-hotspot mutations are located away from the HEAT repeat domains, which suggests that they may have different effects on cancer cells or simply are passenger mutations, and are not the focus of the present study. We calculated an electrostatic potential map based on a homology model of SF3B1WT with importin-β and observed that all hotspot mutations are co-localized in a limited, positively charged region even though they are distributed across five different HEAT domains (Figure 7A). Furthermore, while there are various amino acid substitutions at the hotspots that result in change of size and/or polarity of side chains, our data suggest the functional consequences on splicing for these changes are similar. We show that hotspot SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ splicing in junctions associated with specific sequence features: an enrichment of As followed by a short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG located −15 to −24 nt from the canonical 3′ ss.

The position of the hotspot mutations located in the five HEAT repeat domains (highlighted in yellow) is represented in the inset. (B and C) Schematic representation of splicing in SF3B1WT (B) and SF3B1MUT (C) cells and molecular consequences of transcripts is also shown. Figure options Based on computational analysis, it was recently suggested that SF3B1 mutations cause a change in the size of the sterically protected region downstream of the BP without any altered BP recognition allowing the utilization of the cryptic AG (DeBoever et al., 2015). It was also suggested that SF3B1 mutations could alter interactions with U2AF2, affecting the ability to recognize the canonical 3′ ss and leading to cryptic 3′ ss selection. In contrast, we provide experimental evidence that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is insufficient for the recruitment of the U2AF complex and that the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss, and thereby interaction with U2AF2 is required to observe aberrant splicing as well. In addition, we have demonstrated that the SF3B1MUT U2 complex utilizes a BP that is different from the one used by the wild-type U2 complex (proposed model, Figures 7B and 7C). Based on these data and the restricted localization of the hotspot mutations, we hypothesize that SF3B1MUT interacts differently with the pre-mRNA or splicing factors that are important for the recognition of AG during the second step of splicing. The close proximity of the two mapped BPs for ZDHHC16 (−30A for SF3B1WT and −34A for SF3B1MUT) reported here (Figure 4E) and the published data on the crosslinking of SF3B1 to bases flanking the BPS (Gozani et al., 1998) would suggest a competition between the SF3B1WT- and SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 snRNP complexes to select the canonical or cryptic AG for splicing, respectively. The mechanism by which SF3B1MUT favors selection of a different BP can only be speculated at this point. Based on our data and a previous study investigating spliceostatin A’s mechanism of action (Corrionero et al., 2011), there are at least two hypotheses: the selection of the new BP is guided by SF3B1MUT through enhanced direct interactions with specific nucleotides flanking the new BPS compensating for reduced base pairing with U2 snRNA or by the base pairing of U2 snRNA with the new/suboptimal BPS compensating for impaired interactions of SF3B1MUT across the canonical BPS.  Although SF3B1MUT does not seem to affect the pre-assembly of U2 snRNP (preliminary data not shown), it is possible that the interactions with splicing factors involved in selection of an alternative AG in the second step of splicing are impaired. Previously, it has been reported that the second step splicing factor, Slu7, is required for correct 3′ ss selection (Chua and Reed, 1999a ;  Chua and Reed, 1999b). Similar to U2AF1, Slu7 harbors a Zn knuckle domain, and it is conceivable that it directly interacts with AG during the second step of splicing. As observed in the case of SF3B1MUT, depletion of Slu7 results in selection of a cryptic AG closer to the BPS. This suggests that SF3B1 hotspot mutations may impair the recruitment of Slu7 to the catalytic core. Additionally, it has been reported that splicing factor SPF45 (hSPF45 is RBM17) is involved in recognition and activation of an alternative AG upstream of the canonical 3′ ss. It has been suggested that SPF45 directly or indirectly binds to the upstream alternative AG with the help of SF3B1 and promotes its utilization during the second catalytic step (Corsini et al., 2007 ;  Lallena et al., 2002). Interestingly, as observed in the present study for SF3B1MUT, SPF45 also depends on the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss to splice at the alternative AG. Since SF3B1MUT binds at a different BPS, it can be speculated that the recruited SPF45 can access the cryptic AG which is otherwise prevented due to the steric hindrance by SF3B1WT. Taken together, the SF3B1 hotspot mutations could be facilitating SPF45 activity and/or abrogating Slu7 activity for selection of the aberrant AG, thereby providing an unanticipated mechanism for regulation of splice site utilization.  Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is a known cellular mechanism that adds complexity and flexibility in gene expression to induce stage-specific patterns not only by inducing expression of a particular isoform but also by engaging NMD to downregulate gene expression (Ge and Porse, 2014 ;  Kalyna et al., 2012). Here, we predicted that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced transcripts in SF3B1MUT cells are NMD sensitive, and we have demonstrated that the associated canonical isoforms are downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels. The downregulation of a large number of genes induced by this “spliceosome sickness” could be the cause of impaired cell functions that contribute to cancer phenotypes and potentially create dependency on essential genes or pathways for survival. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency is a proposed mechanism for disease pathogenesis in MDS, where chromosome 5q is deleted and decreased expression of genes located on the remaining chromosome is observed (e.g., RPS14 and CSKN1A1; Ebert et al., 2008 ;  Schneider et al., 2014). It is plausible that SF3B1 mutations contribute to MDS in a similar fashion by downregulating expression of certain genes resulting in a non-classical path to haploinsufficiency. In addition to the downregulation of canonical proteins, it is also possible that NMD-insensitive aberrant transcripts are translated into aberrant proteins that have altered function. Proteomic analysis of isogenic SF3B1MUT cells did not reveal the presence of aberrant proteins (data not shown), but this may be due to limitations of assay sensitivity, and additional targeted SILAC or deep RNA sequencing of active ribosome fractions may have the required sensitivity to detect such proteins. Recently, several groups reported the molecular consequences and phenotypic effects of other spliceosome mutations, such as U2AF1 and the exonic splicing enhancer binding serine/arginine-rich protein SRSF2 ( Ilagan et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015 ;  Shirai et al., 2015). Though there are some overlaps in genes differentially spliced in tissues affected by each spliceosome mutation, we see only minimal overlaps in predicted NMD targets (Figure S7). However, mutations in all three splicing factors are observed in MDS and are mutually exclusive, suggesting that some of the downstream effects might be common. Thus, while not explored in this study, it is likely that SF3B1 mutations result in defects in hematopoiesis, as has been observed in animal models of SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations. Additional work is ongoing to define the downstream splicing abnormalities that drive the phenotypic effects of spliceosome mutations. Finally, it is also plausible that mutations in SF3B1 impact other proposed splicing regulators (e.g., chromatin, histone modifications), and these should be the subject of future study ( de Almeida et al., 2011; Kfir et al., 2015 ;  Khan et al., 2013).  In summary, computational and experimental approaches were used to demonstrate that SF3B1MUT utilizes a different BP to induce aberrant splicing across multiple cancer types. These insights describe a neomorphic activity for SF3B1 mutations that causes downregulation of canonical protein expression. Furthermore, these studies provide a foundation for the potential discovery of targeted approaches for the treatment of patients carrying SF3B1 hotspot mutations.  Uveal melanoma, the most common eye malignancy causes severe visual morbidity and is fatal in about 50% of patients. Primary uveal melanoma can be cured by surgery or radiotherapy, but the metastatic disease is treatment refractory. To understand comprehensively uveal melanoma genetics, we performed SNP arrays and whole genome sequencing on 12 primary uveal melanomas. We observed only ~2000 predicted somatic single nucleotide variants per tumor and low levels of aneuploidy. We did not observe an ultraviolet radiation DNA-damage signature, but identified SF3B1 mutations in three samples and a further 15 mutations in an extension cohort of 105 samples. SF3B1 mutations were associated with good prognosis and were rarely coincident with BAP1 mutations. SF3B1 encodes a component of the spliceosome and RNA sequencing revealed that SF3B1 mutations were associated with differential alternative splicing of protein coding genes including ABCC5 and UQCC, and of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) CRNDE.  Keywords: uveal melanoma, whole genome sequencing, GNAQ/GNA11, SF3B1 Go to: Introduction Uveal melanoma arises in the iris, cilliary body and choroid. Light skin complexion, fair hair, blue eyes and the presence of cutaneous nevi are risk factors in uveal melanoma (1), but the UVR-associated increase in cutaneous melanoma that occurred in countries such as Australia over the past 4 decades has not been accompanied by parallel increases in uveal melanoma (2–4). Thus the role of UVR in uveal melanoma etiology is unclear.  Class 1 uveal melanomas present a low risk of metastasis, whereas class 2 tumors are highly metastatic and are characterized by monosomy of chromosome 3 and gain of 8q. Mutually exclusive mutations in GNAQ or GNA11, the principal driver oncogenes in uveal melanoma, occur in ~85% of cases (5, 6), and inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor BAP1 occur in ~85% of metastatic tumors and are associated with disease dissemination (7). Recently, exome sequencing of uveal melanomas has identified recurrent mutations in EIF1AX and SF3B1 (8, 9), predominantly in low grade tumors. Somatic mutations in SF3B1, which encodes a component of the spliceosome, also occur in hematological, breast and pancreatic cancers (10–13). Mutant SF3B1 is associated with differential gene splicing in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (14), but aberrant splicing in SF3B1 mutant uveal melanoma has not been reported (9).  To gain insight into uveal melanoma genetics, we performed SNP array analysis, whole genome sequencing, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 12 frozen primary uveal melanoma samples. Despite its dismal prognosis, we find that uveal melanoma has a remarkably low mutation burden, and we did not observe a UVR DNA-damage signature. However, we found recurrent mutations in SF3B1 that were associated with differential alternative splicing of both coding and non-coding genes that may play a role in the etiology of this disease.  Go to: Results Our discovery cohort comprised 12 primary uveal melanoma T3-T4 tumors that represented different histological types (1 epithelioid cell, 3 spindle cell and 8 mixed cases) and were treated by primary enucleation (Supplementary Table 1). One case was metastatic at diagnosis and 6 patients subsequently developed metastases. SNP array analysis was performed using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 SNP arrays and whole genome sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The whole genome sequence coverage was >30× (Supplementary Table 2) and the data were aligned to the reference genome and duplicate reads excluded. The whole genomes were compared to their matched normal DNA to identify chromosomal translocations, short insertions/deletions (indels) and somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs).  The SNP arrays revealed low levels of aneuploidy in 11 of the tumors and tetraploidy in tumor #7 (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Table 3). The diploid tumors presented recurrent chromosome 3 monosomy (9 tumors), losses of 1p (5 tumors), 6q (3 tumors) and 8p (5 tumors), and gains in 6p (4 tumors) and 8q (7 tumors; Supplementary Figs. S1, S2). These aberrations are characteristic of uveal melanoma, but we also observed loss of 16q in three tumors and gain of chromosome 11 in two (Supplementary Figs. S1, S2). The presence of two identical copies of chromosome 3 in tumor #7 suggested that chromosome 3 monosomy preceded acquisition of the tetraploid state. Tumor #7 also displayed trisomy for 1q and monosomy for 8p. Commensurate with the SNP array data, whole genome sequencing also revealed a low level of chromosomal aberrations. We predicted 2-59 inter-chromosomal translocations, 0-7 intra-chromosomal translocations, no inversions, 2-25 large deletions and 0-5 large insertions (Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Table 4). Thus, the frequency of structural variations in uveal melanoma is only ~40% of that reported in cutaneous melanoma and only ~20% of that reported in acral melanoma (Fig 1A)(15, 16). It is also only ~10% of that we recently found in mucosal melanoma (Fig. 1A) (17).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Somatic mutations in uveal melanoma. The whole genome sequencing also revealed a very low number of SNVs. We predicted only 1629-2604 (median 2112) somatic SNVs and 47-178 (median 67) somatic short indels (Table 1). The SNV mutation rate of <1 per Mb (Table 1) is markedly lower than is seen in most other types of cancer (Fig. 1B) and significantly lower than is seen in cutaneous (~30,000 mutations/genome), mucosal (~8000 mutations/genome), or acral (~5,000 mutations/genome) melanoma (15–17).  Table 1 Table 1 Summary of whole genome sequencing mutations for uveal melanoma. UVR-induced DNA damage is characterized by C>T transitions at the 3’ end of pyrimidine dinucleotides (18), a “signature” that accounts for 80-90% of mutations in cutaneous melanoma, and up to 60% of the mutations in acral melanoma (15, 16). Although C to T (G to A) transitions were the commonest mutation in uveal melanoma, they accounted for only ~35% of the lesions (Fig. 1C) and were not enriched at the 3’ position of pyrimidine dimers (Fig. 1D). Thus, UVR induced DNA damage does not appear to play a role in uveal melanomagenesis.  In line with the generally low level of mutations, we observed very few coding region mutations, predicting only 4-19 non-synonymous SNVs per tumor; of which 92% of those tested were validated by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Table 5). We also predicted only 0-2 coding region indels per tumor (Table 1). The only recurrent mutations were A>T, p.209L mutations in GNA11 (7 tumors) and T>A/T>G, p.209L mutations in GNAQ (3 tumors; Supplementary Table 6). We did, however, observe a small number of non-recurrent mutations in individual genes with possible functional significance, including C>T p.P107L in GNA15 that was coincident with A>T, p.209L GNA11 in tumor #10, C>T p.G8R in EIF1AX in tumor #8, and BAP1 mutations in 7 tumors (Supplementary Table 6).  Critically, we also observed non-recurrent mutations in SF3B1 in three tumors (T>G, p.K666T: tumor #6; T>C, p.K700E: tumor #11; C>T, p.R625H: tumor #12) and although there were no chromosome losses or gains in the region encoding SF3B1 (2q33.1) these data suggested a role for SF3B1 in uveal melanoma. We screened SF3B1 in 105 additional consecutive archival primary uveal melanomas and detected 15 additional mutations (8 p.R625H, 4 p.R625C, 1 p.R625P, 1 p.R625L, 1 p.K666T; Supplementary Table 7). Our overall mutation rate of 15% (18/119) is similar to the rate (18.6%) recently reported for SF3B1 mutations in uveal melanoma by whole exome sequencing (9), but note that in addition to the R625 codon mutations reported therein, we also observed K666 and K700 codon mutations (Supplementary Fig. S3). The SF3B1 mutations are inversely associated with chromosome 3 monosomy and notably, they are associated with improved progression-free and cancer survival (Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Fig. S4).  SF3B1 encodes subunit 1 of splicing factor 3b, a component of the spliceosome, so to evaluate the effects of SF3B1 mutations on uveal melanoma transcripts, we hybridized three SF3B1 mutated tumors and three SF3B1 wild-type tumors to Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Arrays (HTA2), which contain both exon and exon-exon junction probes. 325 genes were predicted to be differentially expressed, with 46 genes up-regulated and 279 genes down-regulated in the SF3B1 mutant compared to the SF3B1 wild-type tumors (Supplementary Table 8). Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes did not predict any significant GO term(s), and did not predict KEGG or REACTOME pathway enrichment. However, splicing level analysis predicted 130 genes that contained at least one differentially regulated exon and/or splicing pattern (Supplementary Table 9). Manual inspection of the predicted events by the GenoSplice EASANA® visualization interface revealed eight high-confidence or very high-confidence events, including alternative terminal exons (four events), alternative 3’ acceptor splice sites (two events), alternative cassette exons (one event), and intron retention (one event; Table 2). Critically, six of these events (GUSBP11, UQCC, ANKHD1, ADAM12, CRNDE and ABCC5) were also identified when we analyzed the RNA-seq data from Harbour et al. (Table 2).  Table 2 Table 2 Alternative gene splicing associated with SF3B1 mutations in uveal melanoma. Next, we compared the RNA-seq data from our three SF3B1 mutant to our nine SF3B1 wildtype tumors. For this we used DEXSeq, a Bioconductor package that uses generalized linear models to detect differential exon usage (19), and also MATS, which uses a Bayesian statistical framework to identify alternative splicing (20). 47 genes were predicted to be differentially spliced in these two populations by at least one algorithm (Supplementary Tables 10 & 11). Strikingly, when we compared our analysis of our HTA2 and the Harbour et al. data with our RNA-seq analyses, three alternative splicing events, CRNDE, ABCC5 and UQCC, were identified by all three analyses (Table 2). These data suggest that CRNDE, ABCC5 and UQCC are strong candidates for alternative splicing in SF3B1 mutant tumors, hence we examined the sequencing profiles for three genes in our RNA-seq data. We normalized the number of mapped bases for these genes and compared nucleotide coverage at each base in SF3B1 mutant and wild-type tumors (Fig. 2).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Alternative splicing in SF3B1 mutant uveal melanoma. The profiles for UQCC, revealed clear evidence of alternative terminal exon use in the SF3B1 wild-type and SF3B1 mutant tumors (Fig. 2A). For CRNDE we observed near uniform representation of all bases of exon 4 in the SF3B1 wild-type tumors, but an enrichment of the reads at the 3’ end of this exon in the SF3B1 mutant tumors (Fig. 2B). Finally, in ABCC5, we observed clear evidence of differential splicing of intron 8 (Fig. 2C). Critically, we detected all three of these splicing events when we analysed the RNA-seq data from Harbour et al (Supplementary Figure S5)(9) providing independent confirmation of these alternative splicing events.  Finally, to further validate our findings, we assessed alternative splicing of GUSBP11, UQCC, ANKHD1, GAS8, F8, ADAM12, CRNDE and ABCC5 – the eight genes that provided the strongest evidence of splicing – by qRT-PCR in 74 independent uveal melanomas comprising 58 SF3B1 wild-type and 16 SF3B1 mutant tumors. This analysis confirmed that all eight genes were alternatively spliced in SF3B1 mutant compared to SF3B1 wild-type tumors (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. S6).  Go to: Discussion We describe here the first whole genome sequencing of uveal melanoma, and our data reveal that this is a comparatively simple genetic disease characterized by recurrent chromosomal gains and losses and a relatively low number of SNVs and structural variants. The tumor genomes display a homogenous SNV burden, both in terms of number (1629-2604) and mutation class, and notably, they do not display a canonical UVR-induced DNA damage signature at pyrimidine dinucleotides. The absence of this signature negates an obvious influence of UVR in the etiology of this disease.  We confirm that GNAQ and GNA11 are the most commonly mutated driver oncogenes and that BAP1 is the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor. In addition, we confirm SF3B1 as recurrently mutated in 15% of cases, with a mutation hotspot at codon R625. SF3B1 mutations have been reported in hematological, breast and pancreatic cancers (10–13). Intriguingly, in those cancers codon K700 mutations predominate whereas in uveal melanoma R625 codon mutations predominate. This suggests that either the gene mutations have distinct etiology, so different hotspots are targeted in each disease, or that the diverse biology of the diseases favors selection of discrete mutations. Notably, in common with previous studies (8, 9), we confirm that in uveal melanoma SF3B1 mutations are associated with better prognosis. Thus, in uveal melanoma and myelodysplastic syndrome SF3B1 mutations are associated with improved outcome, whereas in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), SF3B1 mutations are associated with poorer prognosis (21).  SF3B1 encodes subunit 1 of splicing factor 3b, a component of the spliceosome, a large intracellular machine that processes precursor mRNA into mature transcripts. Specifically, splicing factor 3b anchors precursor mRNA onto the splicosome to define the splicing site. Previous studies show that spliceosomal component mutations can alter splicing within a gene, can cause intron retention or can cause aberrant alternative splicing, affecting protein isoform balance and thereby cell proliferation and differentiation (22, 23). In CLL, SF3B1 mutations are associated with alternative splicing at the 3’ ends of genes to generate truncated variants of the vitamin C transporter SLC23A2, the T-cell regulator TC1RG1, and the forkhead transcription factor FOXP1. We show that in uveal melanoma SF3B1 mutations are also associated with alternative splicing (Fig. 2D). We show that in common with CLL, SF3B1 mutations in uveal melanoma are associated with alternative splicing of the 3’ end of transcripts, for example in UQCC, which encodes the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex chaperone, a protein implicated in bone development and stature. We also see differential splicing of ABCC5, a multidrug resistance-associated protein that is implicated in breast cancer metastasis (24) and colorectal cancer (25). Interestingly, in uveal melanoma, we observe evidence of intron retention in ABCC5 in the SF3B1 wild type samples compared to the mutant samples, suggesting that this gene is more efficiently spliced in the SF3B1 mutant than wild-type tumors.  More intriguing, we show that SF3B1 mutations are associated with cryptic alternative splicing of exon 4 of CRNDE. This long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) exists in several alternatively spliced forms and is upregulated in both solid tumors and leukemias (26, 27). CRNDE in general, and exon 4 in particular is alternatively spliced in colorectal cancer and the alternative forms are thought to regulate gene expression by regulating chromatin-modifying enzymes (27, 28). We show that in uveal melanoma, mutations in SF3B1 are associated with cryptic alternative splicing within exon 4 of CRNDE, and considering the comparatively simple genetics of uveal melanoma, it will be important to determine how alternative splicing of this non-coding gene affects cellular function.  In conclusion, we show that despite its appalling prognosis, uveal melanoma is a relatively simple genetic disease characterized by recurrent chromosomal losses and gains, and a low mutational burden. We confirm that GNAQ/GNA11 are the most commonly mutated oncogenes and BAP1 the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor. We identify SF3B1 mutations in ~15% of cases and show these are associated with better prognosis, which will guide clinical management of this disease. Intriguingly, we show that SF3B1 mutations are associated with diverse alternative splicing events, including alternative terminal exon usage, intron retention and cryptic splicing within exons of both protein coding and non-coding genes. Future studies will focus on how these events affect uveal melanoma biology.  Go to: Methods Patient Cohorts  Discovery set Twelve patients with uveal melanoma were included in the WGS study (Supplementary table 1) from whom tumour and matched blood samples were obtained. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Institut Curie and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.  Validation set Consecutive patients diagnosed at the Institut Curie between January 2006 and December 2008 who underwent primary enucleation and with sufficient material at the Biobank were included in the validation series with exclusion of patients with metastasis at diagnosis. Patient characteristics are reported in Supplementary table 6. The follow-up for this analysis ended on December 2012, with a median time of 38 months. During this period, 57 patients (53%) developed metastatic disease and 50 patients (47%) died. Metastatic melanoma was the cause of the death in 43 patients (40%). DNA was extracted from frozen materials or FFPE sections. SF3B1, GNAQ, GNA11 and BAP1 were sequenced by Sanger methods. Oligonucleotide primer sequences are available upon request.  DNA and RNA extraction and sequence analysis  Tumor DNA and RNA were provided by the Biological Resource Center of the Institut Curie. The DNA was extracted from frozen tumor or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples using a standard phenol/chloroform procedure. The total RNA was isolated from frozen tumor samples using TRIzol reagent and cDNA synthesis was performed with MuLV Reverse Transcriptase in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France), with quality assessments performed on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. For Sanger sequencing, gDNA was amplified by PCR and the products were sequenced using dye-terminator chemistry as previously described (16). Primer sequences are available upon request. Sequences were visualized using Sequencher software.  Whole genome sequencing and analysis  Extracted DNA samples were sequenced on three lanes of Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencers to produce paired-end reads of 100bp. FASTQ files from each lane were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh37). Data for each sample were merged and duplicate reads were marked using Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net/). Somatic variants were identified by comparing matched tumor and normal genomes (Supplementary Methods).  SNP array analysis  Genome-wide genotyping for tumor and blood DNA samples was conducted on Illumina HumanOmni2.5 SNP arrays. Raw data files were processed using GenomeStudio and somatic alterations were identified (Supplementary Methods).  RNA extraction and Array hybridization  Total RNA was isolated from frozen biopsy using a miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and quality assessment was conducted using RNA 6000 Nano labchip (Bioanalyzer, Agilent) and by a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo). Total RNA RIN values were between 7.7 and 9 (average: 8.65). Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 ST arrays were hybridized according to Affymetrix recommendations using the Ambion WT protocol (Life technologies, France) and Affymetrix labeling and hybridization kits. 100ng of total RNA were processed in parallel with an external MAQC A RNA to control robustness of data. Labeled DNA mean yield was 7.19 µg (min: 6.27µg; max: 7.57µg). Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Transcriptome 2.0 ST microarrays (HTA2) were hybridized with 4.7 µg of labeled DNA. Raw data, transcript data and exon data were controlled with Expression console (Affymetrix) at the Institut Curie microarray core facility. The benefit of this array is to highlight spliced RNA isoforms using both exon and exon-exon junction probes that can measure excluded or included exons/regions.  Microarray data analysis  Affymetrix HTA2 dataset analysis was performed by GenoSplice technology (www.genosplice.com and Supplementary Methods). We performed an unpaired Student’s t-test to compare gene intensities between SF3B1 wild-type and SF3B1 mutated tumors. Genes were considered significantly differentially expressed when fold-change was ≥1.5 and P-value ≤0.05 (unadjusted P-value). Analysis at the splicing level was first performed taking into account only exon probes (‘EXON analysis’; see Supplementary Methods). Results were considered statistically significant for unadjusted P-values ≤ 0.05 and fold-changes ≥ 1.5 for SPLICING PATTERN analysis and unadjusted P-values ≤ 0.05 and fold-changes ≥ 2.0 for EXON analysis. After bioinformatics analysis of microarray data, a manual inspection using the GenoSplice EASANA® interface was conducted to select high-confident events.  RNA-seq analysis  RNA from the 12 tumor samples was sequenced (Supplementary Methods). Reads were aligned using Tophat (29). Differential splicing analysis between the mutant (n=3) and wild-type SF3B1 (n=9) samples was conducted using DEXseq (19) and events with an FDR <0.1 were regarded as significant. Differential splicing analysis was also conducted by MATS (20), using the mapped read bamfiles as input and events with an FDR <0.1 were regarded as significant. The RNA-seq data from the Habour et al. study (9) were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRA062359) and analysed using the same methodology with the exception that read lengths were trimmed to 99bp. One of the samples described as wild-type SF3B1 was predicted to have an SF3B1 R625C mutation (Supplementary Figure S7) and was designated SF3B1 mutant for the differential splicing analysis.  Splice variant analysis in the validation series  The validation set was used to measure the predicted splice variant of 8 genes using specific probes (Supplementary Table 12). 1.3ng of cDNA were analyzed in duplicate to quantify spliced and unspliced forms by real time PCR. 45 cycles of QPCR were conducted on 384 well plates using QuantiTect SYBR Green reagents (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) onto the ABI 9700HT device. To perform the splice variant analysis, 3 steps were achieved per gene of interest. First, CT values were averaged per sample, then a ratio of spliced form was calculated per sample using the formula: 2-(CT form1 mRNA - CT form2 mRNA). Finally, for each splicing event, a Mann-Whitney U test was applied between SF3B1 mutated and wildtype cases.  Statistical methods  Cancer-specific survival (CSS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to death from uveal melanoma or last follow-up. Event-free survival (EFS) was calculated from the surgical resection to development of metastasis or last follow-up. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method and the difference between groups was compared with the log-rank test. χ2 and Fisher's exact tests were used to determine association between variables. P-values less than 0.05 (two-sided) were considered statistically significant.  Data access  Whole genome, RNA-seq and SNP array data have been submitted to the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under study accession number EGAS00001000472. 
123||The splicing factor SF3B1 is the most commonly mutated gene in the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), particularly in patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS). We investigated the functional effects of SF3B1 disruption in myeloid cell lines: SF3B1 knockdown resulted in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and impaired erythroid differentiation and deregulation of many genes and pathways, including cell cycle regulation and RNA processing. MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared with wild-type cases include genes that are involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1 and CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7 and SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8 and HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. This is the first study to determine the target genes of SF3B1 mutation in MDS CD34+ cells. Our data indicate that SF3B1 has a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link.  Go to: Introduction The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) malignancies characterized by blood cell dysplasia and peripheral blood cytopenia. Approximately 30–40% of MDS patients will develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML).1  The recent discovery of somatic splicesomal mutations in MDS has revealed a new leukemogenic pathway involving spliceosomal dysfunction.2, 3 Somatic mutations in the splicing factor genes SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2 are frequent in MDS patients.4 Importantly, these genes encode proteins that are all involved in 3′-splice site recognition during pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing. Splicing factor gene mutations occur in over 50% of MDS patients, are highly specific to this disorder, and occur in a mutually exclusive manner.5, 6, 7  SF3B1, encoding a core component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, involved in the recognition of the branchpoint sequence, is the most commonly mutated gene found in MDS (20–28% of all patients).2, 8, 9 We and others have shown that mutations of the splicing factor SF3B1 are found in a high percentage (>70%) of MDS patients whose disease is characterised by the presence of ring sideroblasts, including both refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS).2, 8 The close association between SF3B1 mutation and the presence of ring sideroblasts is consistent with a causal relationship and makes this the first gene to be strongly associated with a specific morphological feature of MDS. Ring sideroblasts are characterised by an excess accumulation of iron in the mitochondria of erythroblasts,10 and SF3B1 mutant RARS cases show altered iron distribution characterised by coarse iron deposits compared with wild-type RARS cases.11 SF3B1 mutations are generally more prevalent in low-risk MDS and have been shown to be independent predictors of favorable clinical outcome in MDS in most studies.8, 11 The clinical consequences of SF3B1 mutation in MDS are clear, but the functional consequences of these mutations in human cells remain poorly understood. Altered RNA splicing has been suggested as the mechanism underlying the observed phenotypic changes concomitant to splicing factor gene mutations, including SF3B1; 3, 12, 13 however, the target genes in the HSC of MDS cases with SF3B1 mutations are yet to be defined.  SF3B1 mutations in MDS are primarily heterozygous point mutations. The presence of hotspots and the absence of nonsense or frameshift mutations in SF3B1 in MDS patients suggest that SF3B1 mutations are likely to be gain/change-of-function (neomorphic) mutations. A heterozygous Sf3b1+/− knockout mouse model has been shown to develop ring sideroblasts, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of SF3B1 may lead to their formation.11 Recent similar studies have not made this observation, however.14, 15 Thus, it is yet to be determined whether SF3B1 mutations found in MDS are loss-of-function mutations or gain/change-of-function mutations. In this study, we thus evaluated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell growth, gene expression and splicing in a range of myeloid cell lines and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the CD34+ cells of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  Go to: Materials and methods Myeloid cell lines culture  K562, HEL, TF1 and SKM1 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. TF1 and SKM1 cultures were supplemented with 2 and 1 ng/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, respectively.  SF3B1 knockdown  Three non-overlapping small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting SF3B1 and two different scramble sequences with guanine–cytosine content similar to the siRNA sequences (Stealth Select RNAi, Invitrogen) were used to knock down SF3B1 in myeloid cell lines. For each transfection, 30 pmol of siRNA and 2 × 106 cells were electroporated in an Amaxa Nucleofector I, using the Amaxa cell optimization kit V (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Evaluation of green fluorescent protein-positive cells obtained using the pmaxGFP fluorescent expression plasmid confirmed >80% of successfully transfected cells after 24 h. Readout data are reported as mean±s.e.m. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.  Cell growth assay  Live and dead cells were assessed by trypan blue viability testing and counted using a hemocytometer.  Cell cycle analysis  Cells were fixed with ice cold methanol, incubated with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNaseA, as previously described.16 Data were acquired on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed using FLOWJO software 7.6.4 (FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA).  Erythroid differentiation  To induce erythroid differentiation, K562, TF1 and HEL cells were cultured with hemin 50 μm for 72 h. Erythroid differentiation was studied by analyzing the expression level of γ-globin (HBG1) using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) as described previously.17 Expression of the erythroid markers CD36, CD71 and CD235a was evaluated by flow cytometry as described previously.16  Quantitative real-time PCR  Total RNA was reverse transcribed using Retroscript kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). The expression levels of SF3B1, ABCB7, FTMT, HBG1, KLF1 and B2M were determined using Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). B2M expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input complementary DNA (cDNA). Triplicate samples were run on a LightCycler 480 Real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK) and expression ratios were calculated using the ddCT method.18  Gene expression profiling  Total RNA (100 ng for each sample) was amplified and labeled with the 3′ IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips, as described previously.19, 20 CEL files were pre-processed using Robust Multi-chip Average and data analysis was performed using GeneSpring 7.3.1 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) 7.5 (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), as previously described.19 Analysis of gene set up- or downregulation was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis,21 as previously described (false discovery rate<0.1).2  Splicing analysis using human genome exon-junction microarray  Total RNA was DNAse treated (Invitrogen), purified (Agencourt RNA Clean XP) and amplified (100 ng) using Ambion WT Expression Kit (Affymetrix). The cDNA was subsequently fragmented and labeled using WT terminal labeling kit (Affymetrix). Samples were hybridized onto Affymetrix Human genome exon-junction arrays, which on average contain 119 unique probes per gene spanning every exon and known exon–exon junction. CEL files were analyzed using GenoSplice technology (www.genosplice.com).22, 23 Data were normalized using quantile normalization. Analysis at the exon level was performed taking into account only exon probes. Analysis at the splicing variant level was performed by taking into account exon–exon junction probes using the FAST DB splicing patterns annotation (release fastdb_2012_2). Unpaired Student's t-test was used to determine exon and splicing pattern variation between cells with SF3B1 knockdown and scramble controls. Genes were considered significantly deregulated when fold change was ⩾1.5 and P-value <0.05. Gene Ontology, KEGG and REACTOME analyses of differentially regulated genes were performed using DAVID.24  Splicing analysis using qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing  Splicing analysis of TP53 was performed using Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted individual bands from PCR-amplified cDNA. Primers and PCR conditions are listed in Supplementary Table S1.  Splicing analysis of cyclins CCNA2 and STK6 was performed using a qRT-PCR on cDNA, using primers specific for splice junctions corresponding to exon inclusion or skipping.25 Primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. TBP expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input cDNA.  RNA sequencing  Bone marrow samples were obtained from MDS patients and healthy controls and CD34+ cells isolated using MACS magnetic cell separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), as described previously.19, 20 RNA extracted from bone marrow CD34+ cells obtained from 12 MDS patients and 5 healthy controls was used for deep RNA-Seq. Eight of the 12 MDS cases (four RARS and four RCMD-RS) had SF3B1 gene mutation, whereas four cases (all RCMD) had no known mutations in splicing factor genes (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 or ZRSR2) (Supplementary Table S3), as determined by targeted next-generation sequencing data from a previous study.7  Total RNA was DNase treated (Invitrogen), purified using XP beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and processed (100 ng) using NEBNext Ultra directional mRNA Library prep (NEB, Hitchin, UK) as per the manufacturer's protocol for Illumina with two alterations: custom indexes were designed in house and an additional purification step was performed using XP beads (Beckman Coulter) rather than size selection. Samples were run on HiSeq2000 Illumina sequencing machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome using TopHat,26 which can handle reads spanning exon–exon boundaries. Data analysis was performed using edgeR27 to evaluate the whole transcript expression (false discovery rate<0.05) and with DEXSeq28 to evaluate differential exon usage (false discovery rate<0.05). At the expression level, only genes with at least 10 reads in four or more samples were included in the analysis; at the exon level, exons with fewer than 10 reads were excluded. Gender was included as an additional factor in the DEXSeq model testing for differential exon usage. Selected differentially expressed exons were validated using qRT-PCR (Supplemetary Figure S1, Supplementary Information). Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) v2.3 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) was used for visualization of the sequence reads. Pathway analysis was performed using IPA and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, as described above. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE63569.  Go to: Results SF3B1 knockdown inhibits cell growth, induces cell cycle arrest and impairs erythroid differentiation  SF3B1 was knocked down using siRNA technology in four myeloid cell lines (TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1) that we found to be wild type for SF3B1 (Supplementary Information), resulting in a significant decrease in expression ranging between 50 and 60% (Figure 1a).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting SF3B1 was compared with the corresponding cell line transfected with the scramble control. (a) SF3B1 mRNA expression measured 3 days after knockdown. (b ... Cell growth was inhibited in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown in comparison with the scramble control (Figure 1b). Cell cycle arrest in different phases was detected in different myeloid cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1c). K562 cells showed a significant G2M cell cycle arrest with a concomitant reduction in the percentage of cells in the G1 and S phase. TF1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase. HEL cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase and a significant increase in the sub-G1 cell population, indicating increased apoptosis. Similarly, SKM1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in S and G2M phase with a concomitant increase in the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 and G1 phase, indicating cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and an increase in apoptosis (Figure 1c).  Three cell lines (TF1, K562 and HEL) with SF3B1 knockdown were cultured with hemin to induce erythroid differentiation. We assessed the expression of the erythroid differentiation markers HBG1 and KLF1 using qRT-PCR. A significant reduction in the expression of HBG1 and KLF1 was observed in TF1 and K562 cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1d). In addition, we observed a reduction in the percentage of CD36+CD71+ and CD71+CD235a+ erythroid populations (significant for the CD36+CD71+ population) in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown compared with the scramble control (Figure 1e), suggesting that normal SF3B1 function is required for erythroid differentiation.17  RARS is characterized by FTMT accumulation and low expression levels of the iron transporter ABCB7.17, 29 We have previously shown that SF3B1 knockdown leads to decreased ABCB7 expression and increased FTMT expression in K562 cells.17 In this study, we have extended these observations to the other three myeloid cell lines investigated (Figure 2a). In addition, restoration of SF3B1 expression to normal levels after 10 days of culture was followed by restoration of ABCB7 expression levels to normal (Supplementary Figure S2).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown on gene expression and splicing. (a) ABCB7 and FTMT expression levels in TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1 cells with SF3B1 knockdown, as measured by qRT-PCR 48 h post transfection. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting ... Taken together, these data show that SF3B1 knockdown results in inhibition of cell growth, induction of cell cycle arrest and impairment of erythroid differentiation in myeloid cell lines.  SF3B1 knockdown alters gene expression  To evaluate the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on global gene expression, gene expression profiling was performed in the four myeloid cell lines. For each cell line, we compared the expression profiles of cells treated with two different siRNAs targeting SF3B1 with those of cells treated with a scramble control, 48 h post transfection.  We identified many genes that were up- or downregulated by >2-fold in each cell line treated with SF3B1 siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B). Four genes were upregulated (TFDP1, LOC100505759, MKRN1 and WRNIP1) and five genes were downregulated (ZC3H7A, CREBZF, SGK494, WSB1 and two probesets for SF3B1) in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  Pathway analysis was performed on the up- and downregulated genes in each cell line with SF3B1 knockdown using IPA. Significant deregulation of pathways related to cell cycle regulation was observed in all cell lines and of mTOR signaling and AMPK signaling pathways in three cell lines (Table 1). We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to identify pathways and processes showing coordinated up- or downregulation. Upregulated gene sets include p53 signaling in K562 and SKM1 cells, and several gene sets associated with regulation of transcription, spliceosome and splicing in K562 cells (Supplementary Table S4). Downregulated gene sets associated with the mitochondrial function were found in K562 and TF1 cells, and with cell cycle regulation in SKM1 and HEL cells (Supplementary Table S4). These data show that SF3B1 knockdown in the cell lines studied results in deregulation of many genes and pathways including cell cycle and RNA processing.  Table 1 Table 1 List of significant deregulated pathways in cell lines obtained using IPA SF3B1 knockdown impact on splicing  The genome-wide effects of SF3B1 knockdown on splicing were investigated in two myeloid cell lines (K562 and TF1) using human genome exon-junction arrays. The splicing profile of cells with SF3B1 knockdown (using two different siRNA per cell line) was compared with that of cells transfected with the scramble control.  We observed 2027 differentially expressed exons from 1419 genes, and 507 significant differentially regulated splicing variants (including exon skipping, intron retention and alternative splice sites) of 384 genes in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of CDC7 and SRSF11 in the data from both the cell lines, and of TP53 in TF1 cells. We found a significant overrepresentation of 3′ acceptor splice sites affected by alternative splicing events compared with 5′ donor splice sites (5:1 ratio, P=0.0027, χ2 test with Yates' correction), consistent with the known role of SF3B1 in the recognition of 3′ splice sites. Gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/), and many themes showed significant enrichment of genes affected at the level of exon usage and splice variants (Table 2). Cell cycle and RNA degradation were found to be consistently deregulated at both levels (Table 2). We investigated TP53 differential exon usage by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted bands. We observed exon skipping that was present in the SF3B1 knockdown cells only (Figure 2b).  Table 2 Table 2 Pathway analysis using human genome exon-junction array data at two different levels: differential exon usage and different splicing variant We also investigated whether two cell cycle genes (CCNA2 and STK6) previously shown to be aberrantly spliced in HeLa cells with SF3B1 knockdown,25 were also aberrantly spliced in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown in our study. Consistent with the finding in HeLa cells, we observed aberrant splicing of these genes using a qRT-PCR strategy as described previously (Figure 2c and d).25  RNA-Seq in HSPC from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations  To gain insight into the spectrum of genes that are deregulated or aberrantly spliced in association with SF3B1 mutation in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) of MDS patients, we used deep RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation (SF3B1 mutants), four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation (wild type) and five healthy controls (control) (Supplementary Table S3). Using IGV, we evaluated the expression of the SF3B1 alleles in SF3B1 mutant cases and observed a range of 45–52% of mutant allele frequency, indicating that both wild-type and mutant alleles were equally expressed (Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Figure S4).  We used edgeR to perform differential gene expression analysis of SF3B1 mutants versus wild type and control. At the whole transcript level, we observed a total of 526 genes (253 upregulated and 273 downregulated) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutants in comparison with wild type (Supplementary Table S5). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutants with control, we found 1823 significantly differentially expressed genes (646 upregulated and 1177 downregulated) (Supplementary Table S6). Genes linked to the pathogenesis of RARS and RCMD-RS, such as ALAS2 and ABCB7, were deregulated (ALAS2 upregulated and ABCB7 downregulated) in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. We also observed upregulation of the mitochondrial genes SLC25A37 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and GLRX5 in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control.  We performed an analysis using 121 genes either known to be expressed in erythroid cells30 or described as erythroid transcription factors in the literature. We found 42 differentially expressed genes (37 upregulated and 5 downregulated) when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control. These included heme biosynthetic enzymes (for example, ALAS2, ALAD, FECH and UROD), globin genes (for example, HBQ1, HBA2, HBB and HBA1) and transcription factors (for example, GATA1, GATA2 and KLF1). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we found a total of 32 differentially expressed genes (31 upregulated and 1 downregulated) of which 28 were overlapping with the differentially expressed genes found when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control.  We then performed pathway analysis on the significantly differentially expressed genes using IPA. Many pathways, including heme biosynthesis, mitotic roles of polo-like kinase and TNFR2 signaling, were significantly deregulated in the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type (Table 3). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with control, significantly deregulated pathways included apoptosis signaling, p53 signaling, cell cycle regulation and heme degradation (Supplementary Table S7). We next performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysisand many gene sets showing significant enrichment were identified in SF3B1 mutant versus wild type and control. Upregulated gene sets included several that were related to mitochondrial function, cell cycle checkpoints and mRNA splicing. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with control cases, downregulated gene sets included several that were related to cell differentiation and apoptosis (Supplementary Table S8). Many of these deregulated pathways and gene sets are relevant to the known pathophysiology of MDS and in particular of RARS and RCMD-RS.  Table 3 Table 3 Pathway analysis (IPA) of the significant differentially expressed genes between SF3B1 mutant and wild type obtained using edgeR DEXSeq was used to perform differential exon usage analysis of the RNAseq data to evaluate aberrantly spliced genes. At the exon level, we observed a total of 3506 exons (corresponding to 1924 genes) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (Table 4, Figure 3, Supplementary Table S9). Differential exon usage was observed in at least one exon of genes known to be involved in MDS pathophysiology (TP53 and EZH1), erythroid genes (ALAD, UROD and EPB42) and genes associated with cell cycle (AURKB and CRNDE) and RNA processing (RBM5, RBM25, PRPF40A and HNRNPD). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type cases, we found 3097 significantly differentially expressed exons (corresponding to 2022 genes) (Table 5, Figure 4, Supplementary Table S10). We found differential exon usage in at least one exon of genes involved in MDS pathophysiology (CBL, ASXL1 and DNMT3A), mitochondrial function (ALAS2, NDUFAF6), erythroid differentiation (NFE2L2, PPOX and HMBS) and mRNA processing (HNRNPD, U2AF2 and PRPF8). Interestingly, UQCC1, a gene involved in mitochondrial biogenesis31 and showing abnormal splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases in uveal melanoma,32 showed differential exon usage and upregulation in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with wild type and control in our study.

Table 4 Table 4 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and control, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq Table 5 Table 5 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and wild type, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq To identify pathways affected by differential exon usage, we performed pathway analysis on the genes showing significantly differentially expressed exons using IPA. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, we observed many pathways to be affected, including cell cycle, heme biosynthesis, DNA damage response, mitochondrial and haematopoietic progenitor cells pathway (Supplementary Table S11 and S12). Using DAVID functional annotation tool, we observed significant enrichment of biological themes including alternative splicing, RNA binding, mitochondrion, spliceosome and cell cycle.  Recently, a role for SF3B1 in the maintenance of genomic stability has also been reported where it functions in a DNA damage-induced mRNA splicing complex with BRCA1 and BCLAF1.33 Given that deregulation of the DNA damage response pathway was highlighted by the IPA pathway analysis, we performed an analysis using genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex. Several genes regulated by this complex showed differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (including NUMA1, RB1, CHUK and ABL1) and compared with wild type (NUMA1, PIAS1, SMAD4, BIRC2 and PTK2) (Supplementary Table S13). The overrepresentation of genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex was significant in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (P<0.001) and compared with wild type (P=0.0498, hypergeometric test). We also found many genes to be affected at the transcript level, including BIRC3, BCL2A1, GYPB, HBB and HBBP1 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control (Supplementary Table S13).  Go to: Discussion The identification of frequent somatic mutations of SF3B1 in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts suggests a direct correlation between the presence of mutations and this particular phenotype.2, 11, 13 However, the mechanism by which SF3B1 mutation leads to MDS with ring sideroblasts remains to be elucidated.  To illuminate the role of SF3B1 mutation in MDS pathophysiology, we have determined the effects of SF3B1 disruption on cell growth and gene expression in human hematological cells. First, we investigated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell function and gene expression in myeloid cell lines. Second, we used RNA-Seq to study the global gene expression changes and splicing abnormalities associated with the presence of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients.  We have shown that SF3B1 knockdown in four myeloid cell lines resulted in inhibition of cell growth and disruption of the cell cycle. It has recently been reported that Sf3b1+/− mice showed reduced numbers of HSC and compromised reconstitution capacity in lethally irradiated mice.14, 15 Thus, reduced expression of SF3B1 appears to result in impaired cell growth in hematopoietic cells. Similar observations have been made following reduced expression of other splicing factor genes, including U2AF1.3, 4, 34  We used two different microarray platforms to identify genes deregulated at the transcriptional and exon level by SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Gene expression profiling identified many deregulated genes, with four genes consistently upregulated, including TFDP1, and five genes downregulated, including CREBZF, in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown, several of which have a role in the control of cell growth. TFDP1 is involved in the control of transcriptional activity of G1/S cell cycle checkpoint genes,35 and CREBZF is a potent suppressor of cell growth, the effects of which are mediated through the tumor suppressor p53.36 Next, we employed exon-junction arrays to study the transcriptome in K562 and TF1 cells. We identified many differentially expressed exons and differentially regulated splicing variants in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of the CDC7 and SRSF11 genes, involved in cell cycle regulation and splicing, respectively, and of the TP53 gene. Several pathways including cell cycle, RNA processing, mitochondrion and apoptosis/p53 pathway were consistently deregulated in the cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  In summary, our data on myeloid cell lines suggest that the phenotype observed in cells with SF3B1 knockdown is mediated by aberrant splicing and expression of target genes involved in key biological processes.  RNA-Seq is the method of choice for a comprehensive analysis of global gene expression and splicing. In all relevant studies published to date, RNA-Seq has been performed on unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells from a small number of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations (n⩽3 per study), revealing interesting data.11, 37, 38 MDS arise in the HSC, and it is thus of critical importance that the effects of SF3B1 mutation on the transcriptome are studied in the cell of origin. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq on purified bone marrow CD34+ cells from 12 MDS patients, eight with ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutation and four without mutation in other splicing factor genes, and from five healthy controls.  We identified many significantly differentially expressed genes at the transcript level and the exon level when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. CD34+ cells from RCMD-RS and RARS patients display a particular expression profile of mitochondria-related genes;17, 20 we observed upregulation of ALAS2 (heme biosynthesis enzyme) and downregulation of ABCB7 (involved in the transport of iron from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm) in SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control, in agreement with our previous reports.17, 20 SLC25A37, encoding a mitochondrial iron importer, and GLRX5, encoding another mitochondrial protein, were both significantly upregulated in CD34+ cells of SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control. A recent study showed SLC25A37 mRNA upregulation in SF3B1 mutant bone marrow mononuclear cells of three MDS patients with RARS/-T.38 Evidence is thus mounting to suggest that upregulation of the iron importer SLC25A37 and downregulation of iron exporter ABCB7 may be linked to the increased mitochondrial iron accumulation observed in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts.39 Deregulation of these genes could also be consistent with an impaired ability of mitochondrial pathways to use iron that may result in an attempt to increase iron availability.  Importantly, we observed many genes associated with porphyrin and heme biosynthesis showing differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant cases, indicating altered splicing. These include ALAD and UROD when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and ALAS2 and PPOX when comparing with wild type. We suggest that the aberrant expression and exon usage of mitochondrial and heme-related genes in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation has a role in ring sideroblast formation and abnormal iron homeostasis observed in this patient group. Intriguingly, the most common congenital sideroblastic anemia (X-linked sideroblastic anemia) results from an ALAS2 mutation.40  The relative expression levels of the transcription factors GATA1 and GATA2 differed from normal in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation. The dynamic and strictly regulated change of expression from GATA2 to GATA1 during erythropoiesis has a crucial role,41 and any alteration of this pattern may be predicted to lead to aberrant erythropoiesis. We suggest that the aberrant expression and splicing of erythroid-related genes observed in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation may have a role in the ineffective erythropoiesis found in these patients.  In a previous study, RNA-Seq was used to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow mononuclear cells of two MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation to that of one healthy control.11 One hundred and thirty genes showed significant differential expression, 28 of which overlap with the genes differentially expressed between SF3B1 mutant and control in our study of CD34+ cells. These genes include MAP3K8 and CLEC5A, which have been previously shown to be downregulated in MDS.19, 42 Furthermore, 350 genes showed differential exon usage, and 52 of these were in common with the genes showing differential exon usage in our study of CD34+ cells. The overlapping genes include EZH1, ASXL1, CBL1 and SMAD4.  The mutant forms of ASXL1, CBL and TP53 are known to have an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of MDS, and intriguingly all these genes were found to be alternatively spliced in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  A recent study identified a DNA damage-induced BRCA1 protein complex containing BCLAF1 and SF3B1 (BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex).33 In response to DNA damage, the complex regulates pre-mRNA splicing of genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair and hence affects their transcription and pre-mRNA maturation.33 Importantly, we found many of the genes regulated by this complex to be differentially expressed and to show differential exon usage in our study. Genes showing differential transcript level changes included BIRC3 and BCL2A1, whereas NUMA1 showed differential exon usage when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we also found differential exon usage of the PIAS1 gene, a DNA damage response regulator.43, 44 It has been demonstrated that abrogation of members of this complex including BRCA1 and BCLAF1 results in genomic instability,33 a common feature of malignant cells. In MDS patients with mutant SF3B1, the function of this complex may be impaired, with possible downstream effects on the efficiency of DNA damage repair.  Many genes involved in RNA splicing and processing were found to show differential transcript levels, as well as differential exon usage in our study, including HNRNPD, U2AF2, PRPF8 and RBM25. A recent study showed RNA processing genes to be misspliced in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of MDS/AML patients with U2AF1 mutation.45 Intriguingly, there is limited overlap between the genes misspliced as a result of U2AF1 mutation and the RNA processing/splicing genes deregulated/aberrantly spliced in our SF3B1 mutant cases in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, suggesting that this process may be affected by different splicing mutations even if their target genes are distinct.  A recent study showed that defects in the splicing factor gene PRPF8 result in missplicing in myeloid malignancies and are associated with the presence of ring sideroblasts in advanced MDS and AML.46 Interestingly, we observed differential exon usage of PRPF8 in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with control in our study, indicating a link between SF3B1 and PRPF8 and the ring sideroblast phenotype. Our finding of differential exon usage of multiple RNA processing/splicing genes in the HSPC of cases with SF3B1 mutation points towards an exacerbation of aberrant splicing, with a wider number of downstream target genes affected. Emerging evidence from our study on SF3B1 and the study on U2AF145 thus supports the hypothesis that in MDS patients harboring splicing factor mutations, there is widespread disruption of the splicing machinery as a consequence of downstream effects of the mutant protein. Loss-of-function mutations in zebrafish Prpf8 have been shown to result in missplicing of TP53.47 We found TP53 to be aberrantly spliced in MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation compared with wild type and control.  Splicing factor mutations, including SF3B1, are considered to be founder mutations and must confer a selective growth advantage to the HSC, but how this occurs remains a mystery. We have identified differential splicing in several genes known to have a role in MDS pathogenesis, including TP53 and ASXL1, as well as genes involved in DNA damage repair, in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations. We suggest that the aberrant splicing of such genes may confer oncogenic properties that help drive the malignant process. In this study, we have determined the target genes of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients with ring sideroblasts, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying this phenotype.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and related disorders (myelodysplasia) comprise a group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by deregulated, dysplastic blood cell production and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)1 . Although the prevalence ofMDS has not been determined precisely, more than 10,000 people are estimated to develop myelodysplasia annually in the United States2 . Their indolent clinical course before leukaemic transformation and ineffective haematopoiesis with evidence of myeloid dysplasia indicate a pathogenesis distinct from that involved in de novo AML. Currently, a number of gene mutations and cytogenetic changes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS, including mutations of RAS, TP53 and RUNX1, and more recently ASXL1, c-CBL, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, TET2 and EZH2 (ref. 3). Nevertheless, mutations of this set of genes do not fully explain the pathogenesis of MDS because they are also commonly found in other myeloid malignancies and roughly 20% of MDS cases have no known genetic changes (ref. 4 and unpublished data). In particular, the genetic alterations responsible for the dysplastic phenotypes and ineffective haematopoiesis of myelodysplasia are poorly understood. Meanwhile, the recent development of massively parallel sequencing technologies has provided an expanded opportunity to discover genetic changes across the entire genomes or protein-coding sequences in human cancers at a single-nucleotide level5–10, which could be successfully applied to the genetic analysis of myelodysplasia to obtain a better understanding of its pathogenesis. Overview of genetic alterations In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of paired tumour/control DNA from 29 patients with myelodysplasia (Supplementary Table 1). Although incapable of detecting non-coding mutations and gene rearrangements, the whole-exome approach is a well-established strategy for obtaining comprehensive registries of protein-coding mutations at low cost and high performance. With a mean coverage of 133.8, 80.4% of the target sequences were analysed at more than 320 depth on average (Supplementary Fig. 1). All the candidates for somatic mutations (N 5 497) generated through our data analysis pipeline were subjected to validation using Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Methods I and Supplementary Fig. 2). Finally, 268 non-synonymous somatic mutations were confirmed with an overall true positive rate of 53.9% (Supplementary Fig. 3), including 206 missense, 25 nonsense, and 10 splice site mutations, and 27 frameshift-causing insertions/deletions (indels) (Supplementary Fig. 4). The mutation rate of 9.2 (0–21) per sample was significantly lower than that in solid tumours (16.2–302)7,11,12 and multiple myeloma (32.4)6 , but was comparable to that in AML (7.3–13)13–15 and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (11.5)16. Combined with the genomic copy number profile obtained by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array karyotyping, this array of somatic mutations provided a landscape of myelodysplasia genomes (Supplementary Fig. 5)17,18. 1 Cancer Genomics Project, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan. 2 Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 3 Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Manheim of the University of Heidelberg, 1–3 Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer, Mannheim 68167, Germany. 4 Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 5 Laboratory of Functional Genomics, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 6 Laboratory of Sequence Data Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 7 Division of Systems Biomedical Technology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 8 Nakauchi Stem Cell and Organ Regeneration Project, Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 9 Department of Hematology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8571, Japan. 10Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Ohtsuka Hospital, 2-8-1 Minami-Ohtsuka, Toshima-ku, Tokyo 170-0005, Japan. 11Division of Hematology, Internal Medicine, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, 1-30 Fujigaoka, Aoba-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 227-8501, Japan. 12Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich 81377, Germany. 13Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8700 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA. 14National University of Singapore, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, 28 Medical Drive, Singapore 117456, Singapore. 15Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University, 199 Tung Hwa North Rd, Taipei 105, Taiwan. *These authors contributed equally to this work. 64 | NATURE | VOL 478 | 6 OCTOBER 2011 ©2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved Novel gene targets in myelodysplasia The list of the somatic mutations (Supplementary Table 2) included most of the known gene targets in myelodysplasia with similar mutation frequencies to those previously reported, indicating an acceptable sensitivity of the current study. The mutations of the known gene targets, however, accounted for only 12.3% of all detected mutations (N 5 33), and the remaining 235 mutations involved previously unreported genes. Among these, recurrently mutated genes in multiple cases are candidate targets of particular interest, for which high mutation rates are expected in general populations. In fact, 8 of the 12 recurrently mutated genes were among the well-described gene targets in myelodysplasia (Supplementary Table 3). However, what immediately drew our attention were the recurrent mutations involving U2AF35 (also known as U2AF1), ZRSR2 and SRSF2 (SC35), because they belong to the common pathway known as RNA splicing. Including an additional three genes mutated in single cases (SF3A1, SF3B1 and PRPF40B), six components of the splicing machinery were mutated in 16 out of the 29 cases (55.2%) in a mutually exclusive manner (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2). Frequent mutations in splicing machinery RNA splicing is accomplished by a well-ordered recruitment, rearrangement and/or disengagement of a set of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes (U1, U2, and either U4/5/6 or U11/12), as well as many other protein components onto the pre-mRNAs. Notably, the mutated components of the spliceosome were all engaged in the initial steps of RNA splicing, except for PRPF40B, whose functions in RNA splicing are poorly defined. Making physical interactions with SF1 and a serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein, such as SRSF1 or SRSF2, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) that consists of the U2AF65 (U2AF2)– U2AF35 heterodimer, is involved in the recognition of the 39 splice site (39SS) and its nearby polypyrimidine tract, which is thought to be required for the subsequent recruitment of the U2 snRNP, containing SF3A1 as well as SF3B1, to establish the splicing A complex (Fig. 1)19. ZRSR2 (or Urp), is another essential component of the splicing machinery. Showing a close structural similarity to U2AF35, ZRSR2 physically interacts with U2AF65, as well as SRSF1 and SRSF2, with a distinct function from its homologue, U2AF35 (ref. 20). To confirm and extend the initial findings in the whole-exome sequencing, we studied mutations of the above six genes together with three additional spliceosome-related genes, including U2AF65, SF1 and SRSF1, in a large series of myeloid neoplasms (N 5 582) using a high-throughput mutation screen of pooled DNA followed by confirmation/identification of candidate mutations (refs 21 and 22 and Supplementary Methods II). In total, 219 mutations were identified in 209 out of the 582 specimens of myeloid neoplasms through validating 313 provisional positive events in the pooled DNA screen (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). The mutations among four genes, U2AF35 (N 5 37), SRSF2 (N 5 56), ZRSR2 (N 5 23) and SF3B1 (N 5 79), explained most of the mutations with much lower mutational rates for SF3A1 (N 5 8), PRPF40B (N 5 7), U2AF65 (N 5 4) and SF1 (N 5 5) (Fig. 2). Mutations of the splicing machinery were highly specific to diseases showing myelodysplastic features, including MDS either with (84.9%) or without (43.9%) increased ring sideroblasts, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (54.5%), and therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (25.8%), but were rare in de novo AML (6.6%) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (9.4%) (Fig. 3a). The mutually exclusive pattern of the mutations in these splicing pathway genes was confirmed in this large case series, suggesting a common impact of these mutations on RNA splicing and the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia (Fig. 3b). The frequencies of mutations showed significant differences across disease types. Surprisingly, SF3B1 mutations were found in the majority of the cases with MDS characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, that is, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) (19/23 or 82.6%) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia with $ 15% ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (38/50 or 76%) with much lower mutation frequencies in other myeloid neoplasms.

RNA splicing is initiated by the recruitment of U1 snRNP to the 59SS. SF1 and the larger subunit of the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF), U2AF65, bind the branch point sequence (BPS) and its downstream polypyrimidine tract, respectively. The smaller subunit of U2AF (U2AF35) binds to the AG dinucleotide of the 39SS, interacting with both U2AF65 and a SR protein, such as SRSF2, through its UHM and RS domain, comprising the earliest splicing complex (E complex). ZRSR2 also interacts with U2AF and SR proteins to perform essential functions in RNA splicing. After the recognition of the 39SS, U2 snRNP, together with SF3A1 and SF3B1, is recruited to the 39SS to generate the splicing complex A.

All rights reserved for 4.3% and 12.9% of MDS cases, respectively, where deregulated iron metabolism has been implicated in the development of refractory anaemia23. With such high mutation frequencies and specificity, the SF3B1 mutations were thought to be almost pathognomonic to these MDS subtypes characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, and strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS in these categories. Less conspicuously but significantly, SRSF2 mutations were more frequent in CMML cases (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Thus, although commonly involving the E/A splicing complexes, different mutations may still have different impacts on cell functions, contributing to the determination of discrete disease phenotypes. For example, studies have demonstrated that SRSF2 was also involved in the regulation of DNA stability and that depletion of SRSF2 can lead to genomic instability24. Of interest in this context, regardless of disease subtypes, samples with SRSF2 mutations were shown to have significantly more mutations of other genes compared with U2AF35 mutations (P 5 0.001, multiple regression analysis) (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, with a rare exception of A26V in a single case, the mutations of U2AF35 exclusively involved two highly conserved amino acid positions (S34 or Q157) within the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger motifs flanking the U2AF homology motif (UHM) domain. SRSF2 mutations exclusively occurred at P95 within an intervening sequence between the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and arginine/ serine-rich (RS) domains (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs 8 and 9). Similarly, SF3B1 mutations predominantly involved K700 and, to a lesser extent, K666, H662 and E622, which are also conserved across species (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 10). The involvement of recurrent amino acid positions in these spliceosome genes strongly indicated a gain-of-function nature of these mutations, which has been a welldocumented scenario in other oncogenic mutations25. On the other hand, the 23 mutations in ZRSR2 (Xp22.1) were widely distributed along the entire coding region (Fig. 2). Among these, 14 mutations were nonsense or frameshift changes, or involved splicing donor/acceptor sites that caused either a premature truncation or a large structural change of the protein, leading to loss-of-function. Combined with their strong male preference for the mutation (14/14 cases), ZRSR2 most likely acts as a tumour suppressor gene with an X-linked recessive mode of genetic action. The remaining nine ZRSR2 mutations were missense changes and found in both males (six cases) and females (three cases), whose somatic origin was only confirmed in two cases. However, neither the dbSNP database (build131 and 132) nor the 1000 Genomes database (May 2011 snp calls) contained these missense nucleotides, suggesting that many, if not all, of these missense changes are likely to represent functional somatic changes, especially those found in males. Interrogation of these hot spots for mutations in U2AF35 and SRSF2 found no mutations among lymphoid neoplasms, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (N 5 24) or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (N 5 87) (data not shown). RNA splicing and spliceosome mutations Because the splicing pathway mutations in myelodysplasia widely and specifically affect the major components of the splicing complexes E/A in a mutually exclusive manner, the common consequence of these mutations is logically the impaired recognition of 39SSs that would lead to the production of aberrantly spliced mRNA species. To appreciate this and also to gain an insight into the biological/biochemical impact of these splicing mutations, we expressed the wild-type and the mutant (S34F) U2AF35 in HeLa cells using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) marking (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Methods III) and examined their effects on gene expression in these cells using GeneChip Human genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix), followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Supplementary Methods IV)26. Intriguingly, the GSEA disclosed a significant enrichment of the genes on the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway among the significantly upregulated genes in mutant U2AF35-transduced HeLa cells (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 11a and Supplementary Table 7), which was SRSF2 (0.7%) PRPF40B (0.7%) SF3A1 (0.7%) Dup (0.7%) U2AF35 (1.9%) SRSF2 (1.9%) ZRSR2 (1.9%) PRPF40B (1.9%) SF1 (1.9%) MDS without RS (N = 155) RARS / RCMD-RS (N = 73) CMML (N = 88) De novo AML (N = 151) MPN (N = 53) b RARS/RCMD-RS CMML AML/MDS De novo AML MPN a ZR AML/MDS (N = 62) No mut (90.6%) U2AF35  (11.6%) SRSF2 (11.6%) ZRSR2 (7.7%) SF3B1 (6.5%) No mut (56.1%) SF3B1 (75.3%) No mut (15.1%) SRSF2 (5.5%) U2AF35  (8.0%) SRSF2 (28.4%) ZRSR2 (8.0%) SF3B1 (4.5%) SF3A1 (1.3% ) PRPF40B (1.9%) U2AF65 (0.6%) SF1 (1.3%) Dup (1.3%) Dup (2.7%) ZRSR2 (1.4%) Dup (3.4%) U2AF65 (1.1%) SF3A1 (1.1% ) No mut (74.2%) U2AF35  (9.7%) SRSF2  (6.5%) ZRSR2 (1.6%) SF3B1 (4.8%) SF3A1 (1.6% ) PRPF40B (1.6% ) No mut (93.4%) U2AF35 (1.3%) SF3B1 (2.6%) No mut (45.5%) MDS without RS SF3B1 SRSF2 U2AF35 ZRSR2 SF3A1 PRPF40B U2AF65 SF1 Figure 3 | Frequencies and distribution of spliceosome pathway gene mutations in myeloid neoplasms. a, Frequencies of spliceosome pathway mutations among 582 cases with various myeloid neoplasms. b, Distribution of mutations in eight spliceosome genes, where diagnosis of each sample is shown by indicated colours.

All rights reserved confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Methods 5V). A similar result was also observed for the gene expression profile of an MDS-derived cell line (TF-1) transduced with the S34F mutant (Supplementary Figs 11b, c). The NMD activation by themutant U2AF35was suppressed significantly by the cooverexpression of the wild-type protein (Supplementary Fig. 11d), indicating that the effect of the mutant protein was likely to be mediated by inhibition of thefunctions of the wild-type protein. Given that the NMD pathway, known as mRNA surveillance, provides a post-transcriptional mechanism for recognizing and eliminating abnormal transcripts that prematurely terminate translation27, the result of the GSEA analyses indicated that the mutant U2AF35 induced abnormal RNA splicing in HeLa and TF-1 cells, leading to the generation of unspliced RNA species having a premature stop codon and induction of the NMD activity. To confirm this, we next performed whole transcriptome analysis in these cells using the GeneChip Human exon 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix), in which we differentially tracked the behaviour of two discrete sets of probes showing different level of evidence of being exons, that is, ‘Core’ (authentic exons) and ‘non-Core’ (more likely introns) sets (Supplementary Methods IV and Supplementary Fig. 12). As shown in Fig. 4d, the Core and non-Core set probes were differentially enriched among probes showing significant difference in expression between wild-type and mutant-transduced cells (false discovery rate (FDR) 5 0.01). The Core set probes were significantly enriched in those probes significantly downregulated in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells compared with wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, whereas the non-Core set probes were enriched in those probes significantly upregulated in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4e). The significant differential enrichment was also demonstrated, even when all probe sets were included (Fig. 4f). Moreover, the significantly differentially expressed Core set probes tended to be up- and downregulated in wild-type and mutant U2AF35-transduced cells compared with mock-transduced cells, respectively, and vice versa for the differentially expressed non-Core set probes (Fig. 4e). Combined, these exon array results indicated that the wild-type U2AF35 correctly promoted authentic RNA splicing, whereas the mutant U2AF35 inhibited this processes, rendering non-Core and therefore, more likely intronic sequences to remain unspliced. The abnormal splicing in mutantU2AF35-transduced cells was more directly demonstrated by sequencing mRNAs extracted from HeLa cells, in which expression of the wild-type and mutant (S34F) U2AF35 were induced by doxycycline. First, after adjusting by the total number of mapped reads, the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells showed an increased read counts in the exon fraction, but reduced counts in other fractions, compared with mutant U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4g). The reads from the mutant-transduced cells were mapped to broader genomic regions compared with those from the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, which were largely explained by non-exon reads (Fig. 4h). Finally, the number of those reads that encompassed the authentic exon/intron junctions was significantly increased in mutantU2AF35-transduced cells compared withwild-type U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4i and Supplementary Methods VI). These results clearly demonstrated that failure of splicing ubiquitously occurred in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells. A typical example of abnormal splicing in mutant-transduced cells and the list of significantly unspliced exons are shown in Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 8, respectively. Biological consequence of U2AF35 mutations Finally, we examined the biological effects of compromised functions of the E/A splicing complexes. First, TF-1 and HeLa cells were transduced with lentivirus constructs expressing either the S34F U2AF35 mutant or wild-type U2AF35 under a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Figs 14a and 15a), and cell proliferation was examined after the induction of their expression. Unexpectedly, after the induction of gene expression with doxycycline, the mutant U2AF35-transduced cells, but not the wildtype U2AF35-transduced cells, showed reduced cell proliferation (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 15b) with a marked increase in the G2/M fraction (G2/M arrest) together with enhanced apoptosis as a 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.5 2.5 0.5 SMG5 DHX34 UPF1 SMG1 UPF3B BTZ UPF2 SMG7 SMG6 * * * * * * * * * 3.0 Mock S34F U2AF35  P < 0.01 (n = 5) b d 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 P = 0.0026 0.0 SMG5 SMG9 DHX34 UPF1 SMG1 UPF3B BTZ UPF2 SMG7 MAGOH SMG6 SMG8 Y14 eIF4A3 PYM UPF3A hNAG WT S34F Mock S34F WT U2AF35 AntiU2AF35 AntiFlag Anti- β actin HeLa S34F MockWT Normalized intensity S34F WT 10–1 10–3 101 100 10–2 S34F Mock Normalized intensity Enrichment score U2AF35 Hits cNormalized expression e f S.I.

To confirm the growth-suppressive effect of U2AF35 mutants in vitro, a highly purified haematopoietic stem cell population (CD342cKit1ScaI1Lin2, CD342KSL) prepared from C57BL/6 (B6)-Ly5.1 mouse bone marrow28 was retrovirally transduced with either the mutant (S34F, Q157P and Q157R) or wild-type U2AF35, or the mock constructs, each harbouring the EGFP marker gene (Supplementary Fig. 16). The ability of these transduced cells to reconstitute the haematopoietic system was tested in a competitive reconstitution assay. The transduced cells were mixed with whole bone marrow cells from B6-Ly5.1/5.2 F1 mice, transplanted into lethally irradiated B6-Ly5.2 recipients, and peripheral blood chimaerism derived from EGFPpositive cellswasassessed6 weeks after transplantation byflow cytometry. We confirmed that each recipient mouse received comparable numbers of EGFP-positive cells among the different retrovirus groups by estimating the percentage of EGFP-positive cells and overall proliferation in transduced cells by ex vivo tracking. Also no significant difference was observed in their homing capacity to bone marrow as assessed by transwell migration assays (Supplementary Fig. 17). As shown in Fig. 5e, the wild-typeU2AF35-transduced cells showed a slightly higher reconstitution capacity than the mock-transduced cells. On the other hand, the recipients of the cells transduced with the various U2AF35 mutants showed significantly lower EGFP-positive cell chimaerism than those of either the mock- or the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, indicating a compromised reconstitution capacity of the haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells expressing the U2AF35 mutants. In summary, these mutants lead to loss-of-function of U2AF35 most probably by acting in a dominant-negative fashion to the wild-type protein. Discussion Our whole-exome sequencing study unexpectedly unmasked a complexity of novel pathway mutations found in approximately 45% to 85% of myelodysplasia patients depending on the disease subtypes, which affected multiple but distinctive components of the splicing machinery and, as such, demonstrated the unquestionable power of massively parallel sequencing technologies in cancer research. The RNA splicing system comprises essential cellular machinery, through which eukaryotes can achieve successful transcription and guarantee the functional diversity of their protein species using alternative splicing in the face of a limited number of genes29. Accordingly, the meticulous regulation of this machinery should be indispensable for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis30, deregulation of which causes severe developmental abnormalities31,32. The current discovery of frequent mutations of the splicing pathway in myelodysplasia, therefore, represents another remarkable example that illustrates how cancer develops by targeting critical cellular functions. It also provides an intriguing insight into the mechanism of ‘cancer specific’ alternative splicing, which have long been implicated in the development of cancer, including MDS and other haematopoietic neoplasms33,34. In myelodysplasia, the major targets of spliceosome mutations seemed to be largely confined to the components of the E/A splicing complex, among others to SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF35 and ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent, to SF3A1, SF1, U2AF65 and PRPF40B. The broad coverage of the wide spectrum of spliceosome components in our exome sequencing was likely to preclude frequent involvement of other components on this pathway (Supplementary Fig. 18). The surprising frequency and specificity of these mutations in this complex, together with the mutually exclusive manner they occurred, unequivocally indicate that the compromised function of the E/A complex is a hallmark of this unique category of myeloid neoplasms, playing a central role in the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia. The close relationship between the mutation types and unique disease subtypes also support their pivotal roles in MDS. Given the critical functions of the E/A splicing complex on the precise 39SS recognition, the logical consequence of these relevant mutations would be the impaired splicing involving diverse RNA species. In fact, when expressed in HeLa cells, the mutant U2AF35 induced global abnormalities of RNA splicing, leading to increased production of transcripts having unspliced intronic sequences. On the other hand, the functional link between the abnormal splicing of RNA species and the phenotype of myelodysplasia is still unclear. Mutant U2AF35 seemed to suppress cell growth/proliferation and induce apoptosis rather than confer a growth advantage or promote clonal selection. ZRSR2 knockdown in HeLa cells has been reported to also result in reduced viability, arguing for the common consequence of these pathway mutations35. These observations suggested that the oncogenic actions of these splicing pathway mutations are distinct from what is expected for classical oncogenes, such as mutated kinases and signal transducers, but could be more related to cell differentiation. Of note in this regard, the commonest clinical presentation of MDS is severe cytopenia in multiple cell lineages due to ineffective haematopoiesis with increased apoptosis rather than unlimited cell proliferation1 . In this regard, lessons may be learned from the recent findings on the pathogenesis of the 5q2 syndrome, where haploinsufficiency of RPS14 leads to increased apoptosis of erythroid progenitors, but not myeloproliferation36,37.

All rights reserved pathogenesis of MDS, where the broad spectrum of RNA species affected by impaired splicing hampers identification of responsible gene targets. Moreover, the mutated components of the splicing machinery have distinct function of their own other than direct regulation of RNA splicing, involved in elongation and DNA stability, which may be important to determine specific disease phenotypes. Clearly, more studies are required to answer these questions through understanding of the molecular basis of their oncogenic actions. METHODS SUMMARY Whole-exome sequencing of paired tumour/normal DNA samples from the 29 patients was performed after informed consent was obtained. SNP array-based copy number analysis was performed as previously described17,18. Mutation analysis of the splicing pathway genes in a set of 582 myeloid neoplasms were performed by first screening mutations in PCR-amplified pooled targets from 12 individuals, followed by validation/identification of the candidate mutations within the corresponding 12 individuals by Sanger sequencing. Flag-tagged cDNAs of the wild-type and mutant U2AF35 were generated by in vitro mutagenesis, constructed into a murine stem cell virus-based retroviral vector as well as a tetracycline-inducible lentivirus-based expression vector, and used for gene transfer to CD342KSL cells and cultured cell lines, with EGFP marking, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from wild-type or mutant U2AF35-transduced HeLa and TF-1 cells, and analysed on microarrays. RNA sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Cell proliferation assays (MTT assays) on HeLa and TF-1 cells stably transduced with lentivirus U2AF35 constructs were performed in the presence or absence of doxycycline. For competitive reconstitution assays, CD342KSL cells collected from C57BL/6 (B6)- Ly5.1 mice were retrovirally transduced with various U2AF35 constructs with EGFP marking, and transplanted with competitor cells (B6-Ly5.1/5.2 F1 mouse origin) into lethally irradiated B6-Ly5.2 mice 48 h after gene transduction. Frequency of EGFP-positive cells was assessed in peripheral blood by flow cytometry 6 weeks after the transplantation (Supplementary MethodsVII). The primer sets used for validation of gene mutations and qPCR of NMD gene expression are listed in Supplementary Tables 9211. A complete description of the materials and methods is provided in the Supplementary Information.

124||The splicing factor SF3B1 is the most commonly mutated gene in the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), particularly in patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS). We investigated the functional effects of SF3B1 disruption in myeloid cell lines: SF3B1 knockdown resulted in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and impaired erythroid differentiation and deregulation of many genes and pathways, including cell cycle regulation and RNA processing. MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared with wild-type cases include genes that are involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1 and CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7 and SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8 and HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. This is the first study to determine the target genes of SF3B1 mutation in MDS CD34+ cells. Our data indicate that SF3B1 has a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link.  Go to: Introduction The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) malignancies characterized by blood cell dysplasia and peripheral blood cytopenia. Approximately 30–40% of MDS patients will develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML).1  The recent discovery of somatic splicesomal mutations in MDS has revealed a new leukemogenic pathway involving spliceosomal dysfunction.2, 3 Somatic mutations in the splicing factor genes SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2 are frequent in MDS patients.4 Importantly, these genes encode proteins that are all involved in 3′-splice site recognition during pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing. Splicing factor gene mutations occur in over 50% of MDS patients, are highly specific to this disorder, and occur in a mutually exclusive manner.5, 6, 7  SF3B1, encoding a core component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, involved in the recognition of the branchpoint sequence, is the most commonly mutated gene found in MDS (20–28% of all patients).2, 8, 9 We and others have shown that mutations of the splicing factor SF3B1 are found in a high percentage (>70%) of MDS patients whose disease is characterised by the presence of ring sideroblasts, including both refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS).2, 8 The close association between SF3B1 mutation and the presence of ring sideroblasts is consistent with a causal relationship and makes this the first gene to be strongly associated with a specific morphological feature of MDS. Ring sideroblasts are characterised by an excess accumulation of iron in the mitochondria of erythroblasts,10 and SF3B1 mutant RARS cases show altered iron distribution characterised by coarse iron deposits compared with wild-type RARS cases.11 SF3B1 mutations are generally more prevalent in low-risk MDS and have been shown to be independent predictors of favorable clinical outcome in MDS in most studies.8, 11 The clinical consequences of SF3B1 mutation in MDS are clear, but the functional consequences of these mutations in human cells remain poorly understood. Altered RNA splicing has been suggested as the mechanism underlying the observed phenotypic changes concomitant to splicing factor gene mutations, including SF3B1; 3, 12, 13 however, the target genes in the HSC of MDS cases with SF3B1 mutations are yet to be defined.  SF3B1 mutations in MDS are primarily heterozygous point mutations. The presence of hotspots and the absence of nonsense or frameshift mutations in SF3B1 in MDS patients suggest that SF3B1 mutations are likely to be gain/change-of-function (neomorphic) mutations. A heterozygous Sf3b1+/− knockout mouse model has been shown to develop ring sideroblasts, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of SF3B1 may lead to their formation.11 Recent similar studies have not made this observation, however.14, 15 Thus, it is yet to be determined whether SF3B1 mutations found in MDS are loss-of-function mutations or gain/change-of-function mutations. In this study, we thus evaluated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell growth, gene expression and splicing in a range of myeloid cell lines and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the CD34+ cells of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  Go to: Materials and methods Myeloid cell lines culture  K562, HEL, TF1 and SKM1 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. TF1 and SKM1 cultures were supplemented with 2 and 1 ng/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, respectively.  SF3B1 knockdown  Three non-overlapping small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting SF3B1 and two different scramble sequences with guanine–cytosine content similar to the siRNA sequences (Stealth Select RNAi, Invitrogen) were used to knock down SF3B1 in myeloid cell lines. For each transfection, 30 pmol of siRNA and 2 × 106 cells were electroporated in an Amaxa Nucleofector I, using the Amaxa cell optimization kit V (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Evaluation of green fluorescent protein-positive cells obtained using the pmaxGFP fluorescent expression plasmid confirmed >80% of successfully transfected cells after 24 h. Readout data are reported as mean±s.e.m. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.  Cell growth assay  Live and dead cells were assessed by trypan blue viability testing and counted using a hemocytometer.  Cell cycle analysis  Cells were fixed with ice cold methanol, incubated with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNaseA, as previously described.16 Data were acquired on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed using FLOWJO software 7.6.4 (FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA).  Erythroid differentiation  To induce erythroid differentiation, K562, TF1 and HEL cells were cultured with hemin 50 μm for 72 h. Erythroid differentiation was studied by analyzing the expression level of γ-globin (HBG1) using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) as described previously.17 Expression of the erythroid markers CD36, CD71 and CD235a was evaluated by flow cytometry as described previously.16  Quantitative real-time PCR  Total RNA was reverse transcribed using Retroscript kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). The expression levels of SF3B1, ABCB7, FTMT, HBG1, KLF1 and B2M were determined using Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). B2M expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input complementary DNA (cDNA). Triplicate samples were run on a LightCycler 480 Real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK) and expression ratios were calculated using the ddCT method.18  Gene expression profiling  Total RNA (100 ng for each sample) was amplified and labeled with the 3′ IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips, as described previously.19, 20 CEL files were pre-processed using Robust Multi-chip Average and data analysis was performed using GeneSpring 7.3.1 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) 7.5 (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), as previously described.19 Analysis of gene set up- or downregulation was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis,21 as previously described (false discovery rate<0.1).2  Splicing analysis using human genome exon-junction microarray  Total RNA was DNAse treated (Invitrogen), purified (Agencourt RNA Clean XP) and amplified (100 ng) using Ambion WT Expression Kit (Affymetrix). The cDNA was subsequently fragmented and labeled using WT terminal labeling kit (Affymetrix). Samples were hybridized onto Affymetrix Human genome exon-junction arrays, which on average contain 119 unique probes per gene spanning every exon and known exon–exon junction. CEL files were analyzed using GenoSplice technology (www.genosplice.com).22, 23 Data were normalized using quantile normalization. Analysis at the exon level was performed taking into account only exon probes. Analysis at the splicing variant level was performed by taking into account exon–exon junction probes using the FAST DB splicing patterns annotation (release fastdb_2012_2). Unpaired Student's t-test was used to determine exon and splicing pattern variation between cells with SF3B1 knockdown and scramble controls. Genes were considered significantly deregulated when fold change was ⩾1.5 and P-value <0.05. Gene Ontology, KEGG and REACTOME analyses of differentially regulated genes were performed using DAVID.24  Splicing analysis using qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing  Splicing analysis of TP53 was performed using Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted individual bands from PCR-amplified cDNA. Primers and PCR conditions are listed in Supplementary Table S1.  Splicing analysis of cyclins CCNA2 and STK6 was performed using a qRT-PCR on cDNA, using primers specific for splice junctions corresponding to exon inclusion or skipping.25 Primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. TBP expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input cDNA.  RNA sequencing  Bone marrow samples were obtained from MDS patients and healthy controls and CD34+ cells isolated using MACS magnetic cell separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), as described previously.19, 20 RNA extracted from bone marrow CD34+ cells obtained from 12 MDS patients and 5 healthy controls was used for deep RNA-Seq. Eight of the 12 MDS cases (four RARS and four RCMD-RS) had SF3B1 gene mutation, whereas four cases (all RCMD) had no known mutations in splicing factor genes (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 or ZRSR2) (Supplementary Table S3), as determined by targeted next-generation sequencing data from a previous study.7  Total RNA was DNase treated (Invitrogen), purified using XP beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and processed (100 ng) using NEBNext Ultra directional mRNA Library prep (NEB, Hitchin, UK) as per the manufacturer's protocol for Illumina with two alterations: custom indexes were designed in house and an additional purification step was performed using XP beads (Beckman Coulter) rather than size selection. Samples were run on HiSeq2000 Illumina sequencing machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome using TopHat,26 which can handle reads spanning exon–exon boundaries. Data analysis was performed using edgeR27 to evaluate the whole transcript expression (false discovery rate<0.05) and with DEXSeq28 to evaluate differential exon usage (false discovery rate<0.05). At the expression level, only genes with at least 10 reads in four or more samples were included in the analysis; at the exon level, exons with fewer than 10 reads were excluded. Gender was included as an additional factor in the DEXSeq model testing for differential exon usage. Selected differentially expressed exons were validated using qRT-PCR (Supplemetary Figure S1, Supplementary Information). Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) v2.3 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) was used for visualization of the sequence reads. Pathway analysis was performed using IPA and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, as described above. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE63569.

Figure 1 Figure 1 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting SF3B1 was compared with the corresponding cell line transfected with the scramble control. (a) SF3B1 mRNA expression measured 3 days after knockdown. (b ... Cell growth was inhibited in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown in comparison with the scramble control (Figure 1b). Cell cycle arrest in different phases was detected in different myeloid cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1c). K562 cells showed a significant G2M cell cycle arrest with a concomitant reduction in the percentage of cells in the G1 and S phase. TF1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase. HEL cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase and a significant increase in the sub-G1 cell population, indicating increased apoptosis. Similarly, SKM1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in S and G2M phase with a concomitant increase in the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 and G1 phase, indicating cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and an increase in apoptosis (Figure 1c).  Three cell lines (TF1, K562 and HEL) with SF3B1 knockdown were cultured with hemin to induce erythroid differentiation. We assessed the expression of the erythroid differentiation markers HBG1 and KLF1 using qRT-PCR. A significant reduction in the expression of HBG1 and KLF1 was observed in TF1 and K562 cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1d). In addition, we observed a reduction in the percentage of CD36+CD71+ and CD71+CD235a+ erythroid populations (significant for the CD36+CD71+ population) in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown compared with the scramble control (Figure 1e), suggesting that normal SF3B1 function is required for erythroid differentiation.17  RARS is characterized by FTMT accumulation and low expression levels of the iron transporter ABCB7.17, 29 We have previously shown that SF3B1 knockdown leads to decreased ABCB7 expression and increased FTMT expression in K562 cells.17 In this study, we have extended these observations to the other three myeloid cell lines investigated (Figure 2a). In addition, restoration of SF3B1 expression to normal levels after 10 days of culture was followed by restoration of ABCB7 expression levels to normal (Supplementary Figure S2).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown on gene expression and splicing. (a) ABCB7 and FTMT expression levels in TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1 cells with SF3B1 knockdown, as measured by qRT-PCR 48 h post transfection. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting ... Taken together, these data show that SF3B1 knockdown results in inhibition of cell growth, induction of cell cycle arrest and impairment of erythroid differentiation in myeloid cell lines.  SF3B1 knockdown alters gene expression  To evaluate the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on global gene expression, gene expression profiling was performed in the four myeloid cell lines. For each cell line, we compared the expression profiles of cells treated with two different siRNAs targeting SF3B1 with those of cells treated with a scramble control, 48 h post transfection.  We identified many genes that were up- or downregulated by >2-fold in each cell line treated with SF3B1 siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B). Four genes were upregulated (TFDP1, LOC100505759, MKRN1 and WRNIP1) and five genes were downregulated (ZC3H7A, CREBZF, SGK494, WSB1 and two probesets for SF3B1) in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  Pathway analysis was performed on the up- and downregulated genes in each cell line with SF3B1 knockdown using IPA. Significant deregulation of pathways related to cell cycle regulation was observed in all cell lines and of mTOR signaling and AMPK signaling pathways in three cell lines (Table 1). We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to identify pathways and processes showing coordinated up- or downregulation. Upregulated gene sets include p53 signaling in K562 and SKM1 cells, and several gene sets associated with regulation of transcription, spliceosome and splicing in K562 cells (Supplementary Table S4). Downregulated gene sets associated with the mitochondrial function were found in K562 and TF1 cells, and with cell cycle regulation in SKM1 and HEL cells (Supplementary Table S4). These data show that SF3B1 knockdown in the cell lines studied results in deregulation of many genes and pathways including cell cycle and RNA processing.  Table 1 Table 1 List of significant deregulated pathways in cell lines obtained using IPA SF3B1 knockdown impact on splicing  The genome-wide effects of SF3B1 knockdown on splicing were investigated in two myeloid cell lines (K562 and TF1) using human genome exon-junction arrays. The splicing profile of cells with SF3B1 knockdown (using two different siRNA per cell line) was compared with that of cells transfected with the scramble control.  We observed 2027 differentially expressed exons from 1419 genes, and 507 significant differentially regulated splicing variants (including exon skipping, intron retention and alternative splice sites) of 384 genes in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of CDC7 and SRSF11 in the data from both the cell lines, and of TP53 in TF1 cells. We found a significant overrepresentation of 3′ acceptor splice sites affected by alternative splicing events compared with 5′ donor splice sites (5:1 ratio, P=0.0027, χ2 test with Yates' correction), consistent with the known role of SF3B1 in the recognition of 3′ splice sites. Gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/), and many themes showed significant enrichment of genes affected at the level of exon usage and splice variants (Table 2). Cell cycle and RNA degradation were found to be consistently deregulated at both levels (Table 2). We investigated TP53 differential exon usage by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted bands. We observed exon skipping that was present in the SF3B1 knockdown cells only (Figure 2b).  Table 2 Table 2 Pathway analysis using human genome exon-junction array data at two different levels: differential exon usage and different splicing variant We also investigated whether two cell cycle genes (CCNA2 and STK6) previously shown to be aberrantly spliced in HeLa cells with SF3B1 knockdown,25 were also aberrantly spliced in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown in our study. Consistent with the finding in HeLa cells, we observed aberrant splicing of these genes using a qRT-PCR strategy as described previously (Figure 2c and d).25  RNA-Seq in HSPC from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations  To gain insight into the spectrum of genes that are deregulated or aberrantly spliced in association with SF3B1 mutation in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) of MDS patients, we used deep RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation (SF3B1 mutants), four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation (wild type) and five healthy controls (control) (Supplementary Table S3). Using IGV, we evaluated the expression of the SF3B1 alleles in SF3B1 mutant cases and observed a range of 45–52% of mutant allele frequency, indicating that both wild-type and mutant alleles were equally expressed (Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Figure S4).  We used edgeR to perform differential gene expression analysis of SF3B1 mutants versus wild type and control. At the whole transcript level, we observed a total of 526 genes (253 upregulated and 273 downregulated) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutants in comparison with wild type (Supplementary Table S5). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutants with control, we found 1823 significantly differentially expressed genes (646 upregulated and 1177 downregulated) (Supplementary Table S6). Genes linked to the pathogenesis of RARS and RCMD-RS, such as ALAS2 and ABCB7, were deregulated (ALAS2 upregulated and ABCB7 downregulated) in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. We also observed upregulation of the mitochondrial genes SLC25A37 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and GLRX5 in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control.  We performed an analysis using 121 genes either known to be expressed in erythroid cells30 or described as erythroid transcription factors in the literature. We found 42 differentially expressed genes (37 upregulated and 5 downregulated) when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control. These included heme biosynthetic enzymes (for example, ALAS2, ALAD, FECH and UROD), globin genes (for example, HBQ1, HBA2, HBB and HBA1) and transcription factors (for example, GATA1, GATA2 and KLF1). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we found a total of 32 differentially expressed genes (31 upregulated and 1 downregulated) of which 28 were overlapping with the differentially expressed genes found when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control.  We then performed pathway analysis on the significantly differentially expressed genes using IPA. Many pathways, including heme biosynthesis, mitotic roles of polo-like kinase and TNFR2 signaling, were significantly deregulated in the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type (Table 3). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with control, significantly deregulated pathways included apoptosis signaling, p53 signaling, cell cycle regulation and heme degradation (Supplementary Table S7). We next performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysisand many gene sets showing significant enrichment were identified in SF3B1 mutant versus wild type and control. Upregulated gene sets included several that were related to mitochondrial function, cell cycle checkpoints and mRNA splicing. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with control cases, downregulated gene sets included several that were related to cell differentiation and apoptosis (Supplementary Table S8). Many of these deregulated pathways and gene sets are relevant to the known pathophysiology of MDS and in particular of RARS and RCMD-RS.  Table 3 Table 3 Pathway analysis (IPA) of the significant differentially expressed genes between SF3B1 mutant and wild type obtained using edgeR DEXSeq was used to perform differential exon usage analysis of the RNAseq data to evaluate aberrantly spliced genes. At the exon level, we observed a total of 3506 exons (corresponding to 1924 genes) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (Table 4, Figure 3, Supplementary Table S9). Differential exon usage was observed in at least one exon of genes known to be involved in MDS pathophysiology (TP53 and EZH1), erythroid genes (ALAD, UROD and EPB42) and genes associated with cell cycle (AURKB and CRNDE) and RNA processing (RBM5, RBM25, PRPF40A and HNRNPD). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type cases, we found 3097 significantly differentially expressed exons (corresponding to 2022 genes) (Table 5, Figure 4, Supplementary Table S10). We found differential exon usage in at least one exon of genes involved in MDS pathophysiology (CBL, ASXL1 and DNMT3A), mitochondrial function (ALAS2, NDUFAF6), erythroid differentiation (NFE2L2, PPOX and HMBS) and mRNA processing (HNRNPD, U2AF2 and PRPF8). Interestingly, UQCC1, a gene involved in mitochondrial biogenesis31 and showing abnormal splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases in uveal melanoma,32 showed differential exon usage and upregulation in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with wild type and control in our study.

Table 4 Table 4 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and control, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq Table 5 Table 5 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and wild type, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq To identify pathways affected by differential exon usage, we performed pathway analysis on the genes showing significantly differentially expressed exons using IPA. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, we observed many pathways to be affected, including cell cycle, heme biosynthesis, DNA damage response, mitochondrial and haematopoietic progenitor cells pathway (Supplementary Table S11 and S12). Using DAVID functional annotation tool, we observed significant enrichment of biological themes including alternative splicing, RNA binding, mitochondrion, spliceosome and cell cycle.  Recently, a role for SF3B1 in the maintenance of genomic stability has also been reported where it functions in a DNA damage-induced mRNA splicing complex with BRCA1 and BCLAF1.33 Given that deregulation of the DNA damage response pathway was highlighted by the IPA pathway analysis, we performed an analysis using genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex. Several genes regulated by this complex showed differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (including NUMA1, RB1, CHUK and ABL1) and compared with wild type (NUMA1, PIAS1, SMAD4, BIRC2 and PTK2) (Supplementary Table S13). The overrepresentation of genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex was significant in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (P<0.001) and compared with wild type (P=0.0498, hypergeometric test). We also found many genes to be affected at the transcript level, including BIRC3, BCL2A1, GYPB, HBB and HBBP1 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control (Supplementary Table S13).  Go to: Discussion The identification of frequent somatic mutations of SF3B1 in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts suggests a direct correlation between the presence of mutations and this particular phenotype.2, 11, 13 However, the mechanism by which SF3B1 mutation leads to MDS with ring sideroblasts remains to be elucidated.  To illuminate the role of SF3B1 mutation in MDS pathophysiology, we have determined the effects of SF3B1 disruption on cell growth and gene expression in human hematological cells. First, we investigated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell function and gene expression in myeloid cell lines. Second, we used RNA-Seq to study the global gene expression changes and splicing abnormalities associated with the presence of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients.  We have shown that SF3B1 knockdown in four myeloid cell lines resulted in inhibition of cell growth and disruption of the cell cycle. It has recently been reported that Sf3b1+/− mice showed reduced numbers of HSC and compromised reconstitution capacity in lethally irradiated mice.14, 15 Thus, reduced expression of SF3B1 appears to result in impaired cell growth in hematopoietic cells. Similar observations have been made following reduced expression of other splicing factor genes, including U2AF1.3, 4, 34  We used two different microarray platforms to identify genes deregulated at the transcriptional and exon level by SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Gene expression profiling identified many deregulated genes, with four genes consistently upregulated, including TFDP1, and five genes downregulated, including CREBZF, in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown, several of which have a role in the control of cell growth. TFDP1 is involved in the control of transcriptional activity of G1/S cell cycle checkpoint genes,35 and CREBZF is a potent suppressor of cell growth, the effects of which are mediated through the tumor suppressor p53.36 Next, we employed exon-junction arrays to study the transcriptome in K562 and TF1 cells. We identified many differentially expressed exons and differentially regulated splicing variants in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of the CDC7 and SRSF11 genes, involved in cell cycle regulation and splicing, respectively, and of the TP53 gene. Several pathways including cell cycle, RNA processing, mitochondrion and apoptosis/p53 pathway were consistently deregulated in the cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  In summary, our data on myeloid cell lines suggest that the phenotype observed in cells with SF3B1 knockdown is mediated by aberrant splicing and expression of target genes involved in key biological processes.  RNA-Seq is the method of choice for a comprehensive analysis of global gene expression and splicing. In all relevant studies published to date, RNA-Seq has been performed on unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells from a small number of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations (n⩽3 per study), revealing interesting data.11, 37, 38 MDS arise in the HSC, and it is thus of critical importance that the effects of SF3B1 mutation on the transcriptome are studied in the cell of origin. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq on purified bone marrow CD34+ cells from 12 MDS patients, eight with ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutation and four without mutation in other splicing factor genes, and from five healthy controls.  We identified many significantly differentially expressed genes at the transcript level and the exon level when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. CD34+ cells from RCMD-RS and RARS patients display a particular expression profile of mitochondria-related genes;17, 20 we observed upregulation of ALAS2 (heme biosynthesis enzyme) and downregulation of ABCB7 (involved in the transport of iron from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm) in SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control, in agreement with our previous reports.17, 20 SLC25A37, encoding a mitochondrial iron importer, and GLRX5, encoding another mitochondrial protein, were both significantly upregulated in CD34+ cells of SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control. A recent study showed SLC25A37 mRNA upregulation in SF3B1 mutant bone marrow mononuclear cells of three MDS patients with RARS/-T.38 Evidence is thus mounting to suggest that upregulation of the iron importer SLC25A37 and downregulation of iron exporter ABCB7 may be linked to the increased mitochondrial iron accumulation observed in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts.39 Deregulation of these genes could also be consistent with an impaired ability of mitochondrial pathways to use iron that may result in an attempt to increase iron availability.  Importantly, we observed many genes associated with porphyrin and heme biosynthesis showing differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant cases, indicating altered splicing. These include ALAD and UROD when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and ALAS2 and PPOX when comparing with wild type. We suggest that the aberrant expression and exon usage of mitochondrial and heme-related genes in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation has a role in ring sideroblast formation and abnormal iron homeostasis observed in this patient group. Intriguingly, the most common congenital sideroblastic anemia (X-linked sideroblastic anemia) results from an ALAS2 mutation.40  The relative expression levels of the transcription factors GATA1 and GATA2 differed from normal in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation. The dynamic and strictly regulated change of expression from GATA2 to GATA1 during erythropoiesis has a crucial role,41 and any alteration of this pattern may be predicted to lead to aberrant erythropoiesis. We suggest that the aberrant expression and splicing of erythroid-related genes observed in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation may have a role in the ineffective erythropoiesis found in these patients.  In a previous study, RNA-Seq was used to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow mononuclear cells of two MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation to that of one healthy control.11 One hundred and thirty genes showed significant differential expression, 28 of which overlap with the genes differentially expressed between SF3B1 mutant and control in our study of CD34+ cells. These genes include MAP3K8 and CLEC5A, which have been previously shown to be downregulated in MDS.19, 42 Furthermore, 350 genes showed differential exon usage, and 52 of these were in common with the genes showing differential exon usage in our study of CD34+ cells. The overlapping genes include EZH1, ASXL1, CBL1 and SMAD4.  The mutant forms of ASXL1, CBL and TP53 are known to have an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of MDS, and intriguingly all these genes were found to be alternatively spliced in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  A recent study identified a DNA damage-induced BRCA1 protein complex containing BCLAF1 and SF3B1 (BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex).33 In response to DNA damage, the complex regulates pre-mRNA splicing of genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair and hence affects their transcription and pre-mRNA maturation.33 Importantly, we found many of the genes regulated by this complex to be differentially expressed and to show differential exon usage in our study. Genes showing differential transcript level changes included BIRC3 and BCL2A1, whereas NUMA1 showed differential exon usage when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we also found differential exon usage of the PIAS1 gene, a DNA damage response regulator.43, 44 It has been demonstrated that abrogation of members of this complex including BRCA1 and BCLAF1 results in genomic instability,33 a common feature of malignant cells. In MDS patients with mutant SF3B1, the function of this complex may be impaired, with possible downstream effects on the efficiency of DNA damage repair.  Many genes involved in RNA splicing and processing were found to show differential transcript levels, as well as differential exon usage in our study, including HNRNPD, U2AF2, PRPF8 and RBM25. A recent study showed RNA processing genes to be misspliced in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of MDS/AML patients with U2AF1 mutation.45 Intriguingly, there is limited overlap between the genes misspliced as a result of U2AF1 mutation and the RNA processing/splicing genes deregulated/aberrantly spliced in our SF3B1 mutant cases in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, suggesting that this process may be affected by different splicing mutations even if their target genes are distinct.  A recent study showed that defects in the splicing factor gene PRPF8 result in missplicing in myeloid malignancies and are associated with the presence of ring sideroblasts in advanced MDS and AML.46 Interestingly, we observed differential exon usage of PRPF8 in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with control in our study, indicating a link between SF3B1 and PRPF8 and the ring sideroblast phenotype. Our finding of differential exon usage of multiple RNA processing/splicing genes in the HSPC of cases with SF3B1 mutation points towards an exacerbation of aberrant splicing, with a wider number of downstream target genes affected. Emerging evidence from our study on SF3B1 and the study on U2AF145 thus supports the hypothesis that in MDS patients harboring splicing factor mutations, there is widespread disruption of the splicing machinery as a consequence of downstream effects of the mutant protein. Loss-of-function mutations in zebrafish Prpf8 have been shown to result in missplicing of TP53.47 We found TP53 to be aberrantly spliced in MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation compared with wild type and control.  Splicing factor mutations, including SF3B1, are considered to be founder mutations and must confer a selective growth advantage to the HSC, but how this occurs remains a mystery. We have identified differential splicing in several genes known to have a role in MDS pathogenesis, including TP53 and ASXL1, as well as genes involved in DNA damage repair, in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations. We suggest that the aberrant splicing of such genes may confer oncogenic properties that help drive the malignant process. In this study, we have determined the target genes of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients with ring sideroblasts, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying this phenotype.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and related disorders (myelodysplasia) comprise a group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by deregulated, dysplastic blood cell production and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)1 . Although the prevalence ofMDS has not been determined precisely, more than 10,000 people are estimated to develop myelodysplasia annually in the United States2 . Their indolent clinical course before leukaemic transformation and ineffective haematopoiesis with evidence of myeloid dysplasia indicate a pathogenesis distinct from that involved in de novo AML. Currently, a number of gene mutations and cytogenetic changes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS, including mutations of RAS, TP53 and RUNX1, and more recently ASXL1, c-CBL, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, TET2 and EZH2 (ref. 3). Nevertheless, mutations of this set of genes do not fully explain the pathogenesis of MDS because they are also commonly found in other myeloid malignancies and roughly 20% of MDS cases have no known genetic changes (ref. 4 and unpublished data). In particular, the genetic alterations responsible for the dysplastic phenotypes and ineffective haematopoiesis of myelodysplasia are poorly understood. Meanwhile, the recent development of massively parallel sequencing technologies has provided an expanded opportunity to discover genetic changes across the entire genomes or protein-coding sequences in human cancers at a single-nucleotide level5–10, which could be successfully applied to the genetic analysis of myelodysplasia to obtain a better understanding of its pathogenesis. Overview of genetic alterations In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of paired tumour/control DNA from 29 patients with myelodysplasia (Supplementary Table 1). Although incapable of detecting non-coding mutations and gene rearrangements, the whole-exome approach is a well-established strategy for obtaining comprehensive registries of protein-coding mutations at low cost and high performance. With a mean coverage of 133.8, 80.4% of the target sequences were analysed at more than 320 depth on average (Supplementary Fig. 1). All the candidates for somatic mutations (N 5 497) generated through our data analysis pipeline were subjected to validation using Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Methods I and Supplementary Fig. 2). Finally, 268 non-synonymous somatic mutations were confirmed with an overall true positive rate of 53.9% (Supplementary Fig. 3), including 206 missense, 25 nonsense, and 10 splice site mutations, and 27 frameshift-causing insertions/deletions (indels) (Supplementary Fig. 4). The mutation rate of 9.2 (0–21) per sample was significantly lower than that in solid tumours (16.2–302)7,11,12 and multiple myeloma (32.4)6 , but was comparable to that in AML (7.3–13)13–15 and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (11.5)16. Combined with the genomic copy number profile obtained by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array karyotyping, this array of somatic mutations provided a landscape of myelodysplasia genomes (Supplementary Fig. 5)17,18. 1 Cancer Genomics Project, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan. 2 Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 3 Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Manheim of the University of Heidelberg, 1–3 Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer, Mannheim 68167, Germany. 4 Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 5 Laboratory of Functional Genomics, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 6 Laboratory of Sequence Data Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 7 Division of Systems Biomedical Technology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 8 Nakauchi Stem Cell and Organ Regeneration Project, Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 9 Department of Hematology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8571, Japan. 10Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Ohtsuka Hospital, 2-8-1 Minami-Ohtsuka, Toshima-ku, Tokyo 170-0005, Japan. 11Division of Hematology, Internal Medicine, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, 1-30 Fujigaoka, Aoba-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 227-8501, Japan. 12Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich 81377, Germany. 13Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8700 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA. 14National University of Singapore, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, 28 Medical Drive, Singapore 117456, Singapore. 15Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University, 199 Tung Hwa North Rd, Taipei 105, Taiwan. *These authors contributed equally to this work. 64 | NATURE | VOL 478 | 6 OCTOBER 2011 ©2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved Novel gene targets in myelodysplasia The list of the somatic mutations (Supplementary Table 2) included most of the known gene targets in myelodysplasia with similar mutation frequencies to those previously reported, indicating an acceptable sensitivity of the current study. The mutations of the known gene targets, however, accounted for only 12.3% of all detected mutations (N 5 33), and the remaining 235 mutations involved previously unreported genes. Among these, recurrently mutated genes in multiple cases are candidate targets of particular interest, for which high mutation rates are expected in general populations. In fact, 8 of the 12 recurrently mutated genes were among the well-described gene targets in myelodysplasia (Supplementary Table 3). However, what immediately drew our attention were the recurrent mutations involving U2AF35 (also known as U2AF1), ZRSR2 and SRSF2 (SC35), because they belong to the common pathway known as RNA splicing. Including an additional three genes mutated in single cases (SF3A1, SF3B1 and PRPF40B), six components of the splicing machinery were mutated in 16 out of the 29 cases (55.2%) in a mutually exclusive manner (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2). Frequent mutations in splicing machinery RNA splicing is accomplished by a well-ordered recruitment, rearrangement and/or disengagement of a set of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes (U1, U2, and either U4/5/6 or U11/12), as well as many other protein components onto the pre-mRNAs. Notably, the mutated components of the spliceosome were all engaged in the initial steps of RNA splicing, except for PRPF40B, whose functions in RNA splicing are poorly defined. Making physical interactions with SF1 and a serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein, such as SRSF1 or SRSF2, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) that consists of the U2AF65 (U2AF2)– U2AF35 heterodimer, is involved in the recognition of the 39 splice site (39SS) and its nearby polypyrimidine tract, which is thought to be required for the subsequent recruitment of the U2 snRNP, containing SF3A1 as well as SF3B1, to establish the splicing A complex (Fig. 1)19. ZRSR2 (or Urp), is another essential component of the splicing machinery. Showing a close structural similarity to U2AF35, ZRSR2 physically interacts with U2AF65, as well as SRSF1 and SRSF2, with a distinct function from its homologue, U2AF35 (ref. 20). To confirm and extend the initial findings in the whole-exome sequencing, we studied mutations of the above six genes together with three additional spliceosome-related genes, including U2AF65, SF1 and SRSF1, in a large series of myeloid neoplasms (N 5 582) using a high-throughput mutation screen of pooled DNA followed by confirmation/identification of candidate mutations (refs 21 and 22 and Supplementary Methods II). In total, 219 mutations were identified in 209 out of the 582 specimens of myeloid neoplasms through validating 313 provisional positive events in the pooled DNA screen (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). The mutations among four genes, U2AF35 (N 5 37), SRSF2 (N 5 56), ZRSR2 (N 5 23) and SF3B1 (N 5 79), explained most of the mutations with much lower mutational rates for SF3A1 (N 5 8), PRPF40B (N 5 7), U2AF65 (N 5 4) and SF1 (N 5 5) (Fig. 2). Mutations of the splicing machinery were highly specific to diseases showing myelodysplastic features, including MDS either with (84.9%) or without (43.9%) increased ring sideroblasts, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (54.5%), and therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (25.8%), but were rare in de novo AML (6.6%) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (9.4%) (Fig. 3a). The mutually exclusive pattern of the mutations in these splicing pathway genes was confirmed in this large case series, suggesting a common impact of these mutations on RNA splicing and the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia (Fig. 3b). The frequencies of mutations showed significant differences across disease types. Surprisingly, SF3B1 mutations were found in the majority of the cases with MDS characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, that is, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) (19/23 or 82.6%) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia with $ 15% ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (38/50 or 76%) with much lower mutation frequencies in other myeloid neoplasms.

RNA splicing is initiated by the recruitment of U1 snRNP to the 59SS. SF1 and the larger subunit of the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF), U2AF65, bind the branch point sequence (BPS) and its downstream polypyrimidine tract, respectively. The smaller subunit of U2AF (U2AF35) binds to the AG dinucleotide of the 39SS, interacting with both U2AF65 and a SR protein, such as SRSF2, through its UHM and RS domain, comprising the earliest splicing complex (E complex). ZRSR2 also interacts with U2AF and SR proteins to perform essential functions in RNA splicing. After the recognition of the 39SS, U2 snRNP, together with SF3A1 and SF3B1, is recruited to the 39SS to generate the splicing complex A.

All rights reserved for 4.3% and 12.9% of MDS cases, respectively, where deregulated iron metabolism has been implicated in the development of refractory anaemia23. With such high mutation frequencies and specificity, the SF3B1 mutations were thought to be almost pathognomonic to these MDS subtypes characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, and strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS in these categories. Less conspicuously but significantly, SRSF2 mutations were more frequent in CMML cases (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Thus, although commonly involving the E/A splicing complexes, different mutations may still have different impacts on cell functions, contributing to the determination of discrete disease phenotypes. For example, studies have demonstrated that SRSF2 was also involved in the regulation of DNA stability and that depletion of SRSF2 can lead to genomic instability24. Of interest in this context, regardless of disease subtypes, samples with SRSF2 mutations were shown to have significantly more mutations of other genes compared with U2AF35 mutations (P 5 0.001, multiple regression analysis) (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, with a rare exception of A26V in a single case, the mutations of U2AF35 exclusively involved two highly conserved amino acid positions (S34 or Q157) within the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger motifs flanking the U2AF homology motif (UHM) domain. SRSF2 mutations exclusively occurred at P95 within an intervening sequence between the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and arginine/ serine-rich (RS) domains (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs 8 and 9). Similarly, SF3B1 mutations predominantly involved K700 and, to a lesser extent, K666, H662 and E622, which are also conserved across species (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 10). The involvement of recurrent amino acid positions in these spliceosome genes strongly indicated a gain-of-function nature of these mutations, which has been a welldocumented scenario in other oncogenic mutations25. On the other hand, the 23 mutations in ZRSR2 (Xp22.1) were widely distributed along the entire coding region (Fig. 2). Among these, 14 mutations were nonsense or frameshift changes, or involved splicing donor/acceptor sites that caused either a premature truncation or a large structural change of the protein, leading to loss-of-function. Combined with their strong male preference for the mutation (14/14 cases), ZRSR2 most likely acts as a tumour suppressor gene with an X-linked recessive mode of genetic action. The remaining nine ZRSR2 mutations were missense changes and found in both males (six cases) and females (three cases), whose somatic origin was only confirmed in two cases. However, neither the dbSNP database (build131 and 132) nor the 1000 Genomes database (May 2011 snp calls) contained these missense nucleotides, suggesting that many, if not all, of these missense changes are likely to represent functional somatic changes, especially those found in males. Interrogation of these hot spots for mutations in U2AF35 and SRSF2 found no mutations among lymphoid neoplasms, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (N 5 24) or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (N 5 87) (data not shown). RNA splicing and spliceosome mutations Because the splicing pathway mutations in myelodysplasia widely and specifically affect the major components of the splicing complexes E/A in a mutually exclusive manner, the common consequence of these mutations is logically the impaired recognition of 39SSs that would lead to the production of aberrantly spliced mRNA species. To appreciate this and also to gain an insight into the biological/biochemical impact of these splicing mutations, we expressed the wild-type and the mutant (S34F) U2AF35 in HeLa cells using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) marking (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Methods III) and examined their effects on gene expression in these cells using GeneChip Human genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix), followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Supplementary Methods IV)26. Intriguingly, the GSEA disclosed a significant enrichment of the genes on the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway among the significantly upregulated genes in mutant U2AF35-transduced HeLa cells (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 11a and Supplementary Table 7), which was SRSF2 (0.7%) PRPF40B (0.7%) SF3A1 (0.7%) Dup (0.7%) U2AF35 (1.9%) SRSF2 (1.9%) ZRSR2 (1.9%) PRPF40B (1.9%) SF1 (1.9%) MDS without RS (N = 155) RARS / RCMD-RS (N = 73) CMML (N = 88) De novo AML (N = 151) MPN (N = 53) b RARS/RCMD-RS CMML AML/MDS De novo AML MPN a ZR AML/MDS (N = 62) No mut (90.6%) U2AF35  (11.6%) SRSF2 (11.6%) ZRSR2 (7.7%) SF3B1 (6.5%) No mut (56.1%) SF3B1 (75.3%) No mut (15.1%) SRSF2 (5.5%) U2AF35  (8.0%) SRSF2 (28.4%) ZRSR2 (8.0%) SF3B1 (4.5%) SF3A1 (1.3% ) PRPF40B (1.9%) U2AF65 (0.6%) SF1 (1.3%) Dup (1.3%) Dup (2.7%) ZRSR2 (1.4%) Dup (3.4%) U2AF65 (1.1%) SF3A1 (1.1% ) No mut (74.2%) U2AF35  (9.7%) SRSF2  (6.5%) ZRSR2 (1.6%) SF3B1 (4.8%) SF3A1 (1.6% ) PRPF40B (1.6% ) No mut (93.4%) U2AF35 (1.3%) SF3B1 (2.6%) No mut (45.5%) MDS without RS SF3B1 SRSF2 U2AF35 ZRSR2 SF3A1 PRPF40B U2AF65 SF1 Figure 3 | Frequencies and distribution of spliceosome pathway gene mutations in myeloid neoplasms. a, Frequencies of spliceosome pathway mutations among 582 cases with various myeloid neoplasms. b, Distribution of mutations in eight spliceosome genes, where diagnosis of each sample is shown by indicated colours.

All rights reserved confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Methods 5V). A similar result was also observed for the gene expression profile of an MDS-derived cell line (TF-1) transduced with the S34F mutant (Supplementary Figs 11b, c). The NMD activation by themutant U2AF35was suppressed significantly by the cooverexpression of the wild-type protein (Supplementary Fig. 11d), indicating that the effect of the mutant protein was likely to be mediated by inhibition of thefunctions of the wild-type protein. Given that the NMD pathway, known as mRNA surveillance, provides a post-transcriptional mechanism for recognizing and eliminating abnormal transcripts that prematurely terminate translation27, the result of the GSEA analyses indicated that the mutant U2AF35 induced abnormal RNA splicing in HeLa and TF-1 cells, leading to the generation of unspliced RNA species having a premature stop codon and induction of the NMD activity. To confirm this, we next performed whole transcriptome analysis in these cells using the GeneChip Human exon 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix), in which we differentially tracked the behaviour of two discrete sets of probes showing different level of evidence of being exons, that is, ‘Core’ (authentic exons) and ‘non-Core’ (more likely introns) sets (Supplementary Methods IV and Supplementary Fig. 12). As shown in Fig. 4d, the Core and non-Core set probes were differentially enriched among probes showing significant difference in expression between wild-type and mutant-transduced cells (false discovery rate (FDR) 5 0.01). The Core set probes were significantly enriched in those probes significantly downregulated in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells compared with wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, whereas the non-Core set probes were enriched in those probes significantly upregulated in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4e). The significant differential enrichment was also demonstrated, even when all probe sets were included (Fig. 4f). Moreover, the significantly differentially expressed Core set probes tended to be up- and downregulated in wild-type and mutant U2AF35-transduced cells compared with mock-transduced cells, respectively, and vice versa for the differentially expressed non-Core set probes (Fig. 4e). Combined, these exon array results indicated that the wild-type U2AF35 correctly promoted authentic RNA splicing, whereas the mutant U2AF35 inhibited this processes, rendering non-Core and therefore, more likely intronic sequences to remain unspliced. The abnormal splicing in mutantU2AF35-transduced cells was more directly demonstrated by sequencing mRNAs extracted from HeLa cells, in which expression of the wild-type and mutant (S34F) U2AF35 were induced by doxycycline. First, after adjusting by the total number of mapped reads, the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells showed an increased read counts in the exon fraction, but reduced counts in other fractions, compared with mutant U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4g). The reads from the mutant-transduced cells were mapped to broader genomic regions compared with those from the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, which were largely explained by non-exon reads (Fig. 4h). Finally, the number of those reads that encompassed the authentic exon/intron junctions was significantly increased in mutantU2AF35-transduced cells compared withwild-type U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4i and Supplementary Methods VI). These results clearly demonstrated that failure of splicing ubiquitously occurred in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells. A typical example of abnormal splicing in mutant-transduced cells and the list of significantly unspliced exons are shown in Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 8, respectively. Biological consequence of U2AF35 mutations Finally, we examined the biological effects of compromised functions of the E/A splicing complexes. First, TF-1 and HeLa cells were transduced with lentivirus constructs expressing either the S34F U2AF35 mutant or wild-type U2AF35 under a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Figs 14a and 15a), and cell proliferation was examined after the induction of their expression. Unexpectedly, after the induction of gene expression with doxycycline, the mutant U2AF35-transduced cells, but not the wildtype U2AF35-transduced cells, showed reduced cell proliferation (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 15b) with a marked increase in the G2/M fraction (G2/M arrest) together with enhanced apoptosis as a 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.5 2.5 0.5 SMG5 DHX34 UPF1 SMG1 UPF3B BTZ UPF2 SMG7 SMG6 * * * * * * * * * 3.0 Mock S34F U2AF35  P < 0.01 (n = 5) b d 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 P = 0.0026 0.0 SMG5 SMG9 DHX34 UPF1 SMG1 UPF3B BTZ UPF2 SMG7 MAGOH SMG6 SMG8 Y14 eIF4A3 PYM UPF3A hNAG WT S34F Mock S34F WT U2AF35 AntiU2AF35 AntiFlag Anti- β actin HeLa S34F MockWT Normalized intensity S34F WT 10–1 10–3 101 100 10–2 S34F Mock Normalized intensity Enrichment score U2AF35 Hits cNormalized expression e f S.I.

To confirm the growth-suppressive effect of U2AF35 mutants in vitro, a highly purified haematopoietic stem cell population (CD342cKit1ScaI1Lin2, CD342KSL) prepared from C57BL/6 (B6)-Ly5.1 mouse bone marrow28 was retrovirally transduced with either the mutant (S34F, Q157P and Q157R) or wild-type U2AF35, or the mock constructs, each harbouring the EGFP marker gene (Supplementary Fig. 16). The ability of these transduced cells to reconstitute the haematopoietic system was tested in a competitive reconstitution assay. The transduced cells were mixed with whole bone marrow cells from B6-Ly5.1/5.2 F1 mice, transplanted into lethally irradiated B6-Ly5.2 recipients, and peripheral blood chimaerism derived from EGFPpositive cellswasassessed6 weeks after transplantation byflow cytometry. We confirmed that each recipient mouse received comparable numbers of EGFP-positive cells among the different retrovirus groups by estimating the percentage of EGFP-positive cells and overall proliferation in transduced cells by ex vivo tracking. Also no significant difference was observed in their homing capacity to bone marrow as assessed by transwell migration assays (Supplementary Fig. 17). As shown in Fig. 5e, the wild-typeU2AF35-transduced cells showed a slightly higher reconstitution capacity than the mock-transduced cells. On the other hand, the recipients of the cells transduced with the various U2AF35 mutants showed significantly lower EGFP-positive cell chimaerism than those of either the mock- or the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, indicating a compromised reconstitution capacity of the haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells expressing the U2AF35 mutants. In summary, these mutants lead to loss-of-function of U2AF35 most probably by acting in a dominant-negative fashion to the wild-type protein. Discussion Our whole-exome sequencing study unexpectedly unmasked a complexity of novel pathway mutations found in approximately 45% to 85% of myelodysplasia patients depending on the disease subtypes, which affected multiple but distinctive components of the splicing machinery and, as such, demonstrated the unquestionable power of massively parallel sequencing technologies in cancer research. The RNA splicing system comprises essential cellular machinery, through which eukaryotes can achieve successful transcription and guarantee the functional diversity of their protein species using alternative splicing in the face of a limited number of genes29. Accordingly, the meticulous regulation of this machinery should be indispensable for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis30, deregulation of which causes severe developmental abnormalities31,32. The current discovery of frequent mutations of the splicing pathway in myelodysplasia, therefore, represents another remarkable example that illustrates how cancer develops by targeting critical cellular functions. It also provides an intriguing insight into the mechanism of ‘cancer specific’ alternative splicing, which have long been implicated in the development of cancer, including MDS and other haematopoietic neoplasms33,34. In myelodysplasia, the major targets of spliceosome mutations seemed to be largely confined to the components of the E/A splicing complex, among others to SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF35 and ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent, to SF3A1, SF1, U2AF65 and PRPF40B. The broad coverage of the wide spectrum of spliceosome components in our exome sequencing was likely to preclude frequent involvement of other components on this pathway (Supplementary Fig. 18). The surprising frequency and specificity of these mutations in this complex, together with the mutually exclusive manner they occurred, unequivocally indicate that the compromised function of the E/A complex is a hallmark of this unique category of myeloid neoplasms, playing a central role in the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia. The close relationship between the mutation types and unique disease subtypes also support their pivotal roles in MDS. Given the critical functions of the E/A splicing complex on the precise 39SS recognition, the logical consequence of these relevant mutations would be the impaired splicing involving diverse RNA species. In fact, when expressed in HeLa cells, the mutant U2AF35 induced global abnormalities of RNA splicing, leading to increased production of transcripts having unspliced intronic sequences. On the other hand, the functional link between the abnormal splicing of RNA species and the phenotype of myelodysplasia is still unclear. Mutant U2AF35 seemed to suppress cell growth/proliferation and induce apoptosis rather than confer a growth advantage or promote clonal selection. ZRSR2 knockdown in HeLa cells has been reported to also result in reduced viability, arguing for the common consequence of these pathway mutations35. These observations suggested that the oncogenic actions of these splicing pathway mutations are distinct from what is expected for classical oncogenes, such as mutated kinases and signal transducers, but could be more related to cell differentiation. Of note in this regard, the commonest clinical presentation of MDS is severe cytopenia in multiple cell lineages due to ineffective haematopoiesis with increased apoptosis rather than unlimited cell proliferation1 . In this regard, lessons may be learned from the recent findings on the pathogenesis of the 5q2 syndrome, where haploinsufficiency of RPS14 leads to increased apoptosis of erythroid progenitors, but not myeloproliferation36,37.

Moreover, the mutated components of the splicing machinery have distinct function of their own other than direct regulation of RNA splicing, involved in elongation and DNA stability, which may be important to determine specific disease phenotypes. Clearly, more studies are required to answer these questions through understanding of the molecular basis of their oncogenic actions.

Mutation analysis of the splicing pathway genes in a set of 582 myeloid neoplasms were performed by first screening mutations in PCR-amplified pooled targets from 12 individuals, followed by validation/identification of the candidate mutations within the corresponding 12 individuals by Sanger sequencing. Flag-tagged cDNAs of the wild-type and mutant U2AF35 were generated by in vitro mutagenesis, constructed into a murine stem cell virus-based retroviral vector as well as a tetracycline-inducible lentivirus-based expression vector, and used for gene transfer to CD342KSL cells and cultured cell lines, with EGFP marking, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from wild-type or mutant U2AF35-transduced HeLa and TF-1 cells, and analysed on microarrays. RNA sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Cell proliferation assays (MTT assays) on HeLa and TF-1 cells stably transduced with lentivirus U2AF35 constructs were performed in the presence or absence of doxycycline. For competitive reconstitution assays, CD342KSL cells collected from C57BL/6 (B6)- Ly5.1 mice were retrovirally transduced with various U2AF35 constructs with EGFP marking, and transplanted with competitor cells (B6-Ly5.1/5.2 F1 mouse origin) into lethally irradiated B6-Ly5.2 mice 48 h after gene transduction. Frequency of EGFP-positive cells was assessed in peripheral blood by flow cytometry 6 weeks after the transplantation (Supplementary MethodsVII). The primer sets used for validation of gene mutations and qPCR of NMD gene expression are listed in Supplementary Tables 9211. A complete description of the materials and methods is provided in the Supplementary Information. This study was approved by the ethics boards of the University of Tokyo, Munich Leukaemia Laboratory, University Hospital Mannheim, University of Tsukuba, Tokyo Metropolitan Ohtsuka Hospital and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Animal experiments were performed with approval of the Animal Experiment Committee of the University of Tokyo  
125||The RNA maturation is an important and complex biological process. It requires several small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that comprise the two forms of spliceosomes. The major form of spliceosome (U2-type) is composed of U1, U2, U4/6 and U5 snRNPs, and catalyzes most splicing events in metazoans.1  Mutations of genes, such as SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent SF1, SF3A1, U2AF2 or PRPF40B, encoding spliceosome compounds have been found to occur at high frequencies in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).2, 3, 4 Subsequently, SF3B1 mutations were also found in solid tumors such as endometrial, lung, bladder, pancreatic and breast carcinomas and cutaneous melanomas.5 We and others also reported that 15–20% of uveal melanoma (UM) carry SF3B1 mutations.6, 7, 8 SF3B1 (splicing factor 3 B subunit 1, also named SF3B155) is a central compound the U2 snRNP complex in direct contact with the branch site of the pre-mRNA. SF3B1 contains 22 HEAT repeats (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, Targets of rapamycin 1). Major hotspots of missense mutations of SF3B1 target one of the HEAT repeats at positions R625, K666 and K700, with variability according to diseases, R625 and K700 mutations being the most prevalent in UM and hematologic disorders, respectively. Prognosis value of these mutations vary according to diseases, SF3B1 mutations are associated with poor outcomes in CLL and favorable outcomes in UM.9 SF3B1 mutations are especially associated with the refractory anemia with excess of ring sideroblasts (RARS), a mild form of MDS with little impact on patient’s survival. Consequences of these mutations on splicing are less clear. Aberrant splicing associated with SF3B1 was reported by two landmark publications.2, 3 However, little overlap was found between MDS and CLL. Furthermore, Harbour et al.6 found no splicing effect of SF3B1 mutations in a series of UM patients analyzed by RNA-seq. By combining exon array and RNA-seq analyzes, we recently reported alternative transcripts of eight genes statistically associated with SF3B1 R625 mutations and linked to various RNA processing mechanisms: alternative terminal exons (UQCC, ADAM12, GAS8), alternative 3′ acceptor splice sites (CRNDE, ANKHD1), alternative cassette exons (GUSBP1), alternative first exon (F8) and intron retention (ABCC5).7  Five of these differential splicing events (CRNDE, GUSBP11, UQCC, ABCC5 and ANKHD1) were most consistently associated with the SF3B1-mutated status. Here we explored whether this splicing signature was also associated with SF3B1 mutations in malignancies other than UM, namely in MDS and CLL.  Series of CLL (26 cases), MDS of various subtypes (48 cases) and UM (87 cases) were assembled. These samples were genotyped for the recurrent mutated genes of the spliceosome, and biological and clinical data were obtained (see Supplementary Table for sample characteristics). After RNA extraction and reverse transcription, samples were analyzed for the two splice forms of UQCC, CRNDE, ANKHD1, GUSBP1 and ABCC5 by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) as described previously.7 CRNDE was poorly expressed in CLL, below the detection sensitivity of the RT-QPCR in most cases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied on the splicing ratio of the five expressed genes obtained for the series of MDS and CLL data, as well as with that of the series of UM previously reported.7 Whereas no disease aggregation was observed in the clustering, all SF3B1-mutated samples clustered in a single branch (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table for complete sample status). More specifically, this group of samples included 8 CLL SF3B1-mutated samples (K700E (6), K666T (1) and G742D (1)), 24 MDS SF3B1-mutated sample cases (K700E (14), H622Q (4), D781G (2), R625L/H/D/C (4)) and 19 SF3B1-mutated UM samples (R625H/C/L/P (16), K666M/T (2), K700E (1)). As expected, most SF3B1-mutated MDS were classified as RARS or refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (16 and 4, respectively out of 23 cases). No SF3B1-mutated samples were misclassified, except one MDS sample, MDS44 and one UM case, UM48, with low but detectable frequencies of mutated SF3B1 allele, which segregated with wild-type cases. Five cases without detected splicesome mutations (one MDS, two UM and two CLL) clustered in this branch corresponding to the mutated samples. The three SRSF2-mutated MDS cases, bearing the P95H hotspot mutation, segregated in the second branch with the wild-type samples, suggesting that this mutant-splicing factor differently affects the splicing process than the SF3B1 mutants. Two MDS samples bearing ZRSR2 missense mutations of unknown functional consequences (K413E and V304M) segregated each in a different branch.  Figure 1.

An unsupervised hierarchical clustering and a heatmap are performed using the difference in Ct (threshold cycle) between the two splicing forms expression for the five genes, measured by RT-QPCR for a series of 161 tumor samples representing 3 pathologies: uveal melanoma (UM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Data were normalized on mean and standard deviation within each pathology and research center. Clustering was performed based on Euclidian distance by Ward’s method. Splicing status is indicated by color code, representing: WT, wild-type status of the tested spliceosome compounds; SF3B1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2, mutated status of these genes, respectively. NA, not available.  Full figure and legend (124K)  Several conclusions could be drawn from these results. First, it is the first time that consistent splicing abnormalities are associated with SF3B1 mutations. The fact that the same splicing pattern is observed in tumor cells from different lineages and embryonic origins, strongly argues for a direct consequence of SF3B1 mutation. Second, the same pattern is observed irrespective of the mutated HEAT repeats of SF3B1. The reason for different hotspot mutations in different malignancies is largely unexplained but no different consequence was detected in the limited splicing events explored here. Third, the other mutated spliceosome compounds present in our series, including SRSF2 and ZRSR2, did not share the splicing abnormalities of the SF3B1 mutants. Finally, while no false negative was present in the clustering, the splicing pattern of 5 out of 161 samples from the three series was undistinguishable from that of SF3B1 samples, suggesting either experimental limitation of our splicing analysis or undetected abnormalities of the splicing machinery.  Our data clearly associate specific splicing abnormalities to SF3B1 mutations but these abnormalities are most probably not limited to those analyzed here. To statistically demonstrate splicing variants among more than 200 000 different splicing events remains challenging. It requires reliable molecular tools such as the latest generation of exon array or RNA-seq, efficient bioinformatics and large series of cases. It is thus likely that only the most consistent events were picked by the analysis of a limited number of mutated cases. Splicing forms yet to be discovered may better explain the oncogenic pathways activated by mutant SF3B1. Finally, our results do not rule out functions of SF3B1 besides splicing, which deregulations could intervene in oncogenesis.

127||The splicing factor SF3B1 is the most commonly mutated gene in the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), particularly in patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS). We investigated the functional effects of SF3B1 disruption in myeloid cell lines: SF3B1 knockdown resulted in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and impaired erythroid differentiation and deregulation of many genes and pathways, including cell cycle regulation and RNA processing. MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared with wild-type cases include genes that are involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1 and CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7 and SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8 and HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. This is the first study to determine the target genes of SF3B1 mutation in MDS CD34+ cells. Our data indicate that SF3B1 has a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link.  Go to: Introduction The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) malignancies characterized by blood cell dysplasia and peripheral blood cytopenia. Approximately 30–40% of MDS patients will develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML).1  The recent discovery of somatic splicesomal mutations in MDS has revealed a new leukemogenic pathway involving spliceosomal dysfunction.2, 3 Somatic mutations in the splicing factor genes SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2 are frequent in MDS patients.4 Importantly, these genes encode proteins that are all involved in 3′-splice site recognition during pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing. Splicing factor gene mutations occur in over 50% of MDS patients, are highly specific to this disorder, and occur in a mutually exclusive manner.5, 6, 7  SF3B1, encoding a core component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, involved in the recognition of the branchpoint sequence, is the most commonly mutated gene found in MDS (20–28% of all patients).2, 8, 9 We and others have shown that mutations of the splicing factor SF3B1 are found in a high percentage (>70%) of MDS patients whose disease is characterised by the presence of ring sideroblasts, including both refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS).2, 8 The close association between SF3B1 mutation and the presence of ring sideroblasts is consistent with a causal relationship and makes this the first gene to be strongly associated with a specific morphological feature of MDS. Ring sideroblasts are characterised by an excess accumulation of iron in the mitochondria of erythroblasts,10 and SF3B1 mutant RARS cases show altered iron distribution characterised by coarse iron deposits compared with wild-type RARS cases.11 SF3B1 mutations are generally more prevalent in low-risk MDS and have been shown to be independent predictors of favorable clinical outcome in MDS in most studies.8, 11 The clinical consequences of SF3B1 mutation in MDS are clear, but the functional consequences of these mutations in human cells remain poorly understood. Altered RNA splicing has been suggested as the mechanism underlying the observed phenotypic changes concomitant to splicing factor gene mutations, including SF3B1; 3, 12, 13 however, the target genes in the HSC of MDS cases with SF3B1 mutations are yet to be defined.  SF3B1 mutations in MDS are primarily heterozygous point mutations. The presence of hotspots and the absence of nonsense or frameshift mutations in SF3B1 in MDS patients suggest that SF3B1 mutations are likely to be gain/change-of-function (neomorphic) mutations. A heterozygous Sf3b1+/− knockout mouse model has been shown to develop ring sideroblasts, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of SF3B1 may lead to their formation.11 Recent similar studies have not made this observation, however.14, 15 Thus, it is yet to be determined whether SF3B1 mutations found in MDS are loss-of-function mutations or gain/change-of-function mutations. In this study, we thus evaluated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell growth, gene expression and splicing in a range of myeloid cell lines and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the CD34+ cells of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  Go to: Materials and methods Myeloid cell lines culture  K562, HEL, TF1 and SKM1 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. TF1 and SKM1 cultures were supplemented with 2 and 1 ng/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, respectively.  SF3B1 knockdown  Three non-overlapping small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting SF3B1 and two different scramble sequences with guanine–cytosine content similar to the siRNA sequences (Stealth Select RNAi, Invitrogen) were used to knock down SF3B1 in myeloid cell lines. For each transfection, 30 pmol of siRNA and 2 × 106 cells were electroporated in an Amaxa Nucleofector I, using the Amaxa cell optimization kit V (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Evaluation of green fluorescent protein-positive cells obtained using the pmaxGFP fluorescent expression plasmid confirmed >80% of successfully transfected cells after 24 h. Readout data are reported as mean±s.e.m. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.  Cell growth assay  Live and dead cells were assessed by trypan blue viability testing and counted using a hemocytometer.  Cell cycle analysis  Cells were fixed with ice cold methanol, incubated with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNaseA, as previously described.16 Data were acquired on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed using FLOWJO software 7.6.4 (FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA).  Erythroid differentiation  To induce erythroid differentiation, K562, TF1 and HEL cells were cultured with hemin 50 μm for 72 h. Erythroid differentiation was studied by analyzing the expression level of γ-globin (HBG1) using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) as described previously.17 Expression of the erythroid markers CD36, CD71 and CD235a was evaluated by flow cytometry as described previously.16  Quantitative real-time PCR  Total RNA was reverse transcribed using Retroscript kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). The expression levels of SF3B1, ABCB7, FTMT, HBG1, KLF1 and B2M were determined using Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). B2M expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input complementary DNA (cDNA). Triplicate samples were run on a LightCycler 480 Real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK) and expression ratios were calculated using the ddCT method.18  Gene expression profiling  Total RNA (100 ng for each sample) was amplified and labeled with the 3′ IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips, as described previously.19, 20 CEL files were pre-processed using Robust Multi-chip Average and data analysis was performed using GeneSpring 7.3.1 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) 7.5 (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), as previously described.19 Analysis of gene set up- or downregulation was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis,21 as previously described (false discovery rate<0.1).2  Splicing analysis using human genome exon-junction microarray  Total RNA was DNAse treated (Invitrogen), purified (Agencourt RNA Clean XP) and amplified (100 ng) using Ambion WT Expression Kit (Affymetrix). The cDNA was subsequently fragmented and labeled using WT terminal labeling kit (Affymetrix). Samples were hybridized onto Affymetrix Human genome exon-junction arrays, which on average contain 119 unique probes per gene spanning every exon and known exon–exon junction. CEL files were analyzed using GenoSplice technology (www.genosplice.com).22, 23 Data were normalized using quantile normalization. Analysis at the exon level was performed taking into account only exon probes. Analysis at the splicing variant level was performed by taking into account exon–exon junction probes using the FAST DB splicing patterns annotation (release fastdb_2012_2). Unpaired Student's t-test was used to determine exon and splicing pattern variation between cells with SF3B1 knockdown and scramble controls. Genes were considered significantly deregulated when fold change was ⩾1.5 and P-value <0.05. Gene Ontology, KEGG and REACTOME analyses of differentially regulated genes were performed using DAVID.24  Splicing analysis using qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing  Splicing analysis of TP53 was performed using Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted individual bands from PCR-amplified cDNA. Primers and PCR conditions are listed in Supplementary Table S1.  Splicing analysis of cyclins CCNA2 and STK6 was performed using a qRT-PCR on cDNA, using primers specific for splice junctions corresponding to exon inclusion or skipping.25 Primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. TBP expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input cDNA.  RNA sequencing  Bone marrow samples were obtained from MDS patients and healthy controls and CD34+ cells isolated using MACS magnetic cell separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), as described previously.19, 20 RNA extracted from bone marrow CD34+ cells obtained from 12 MDS patients and 5 healthy controls was used for deep RNA-Seq. Eight of the 12 MDS cases (four RARS and four RCMD-RS) had SF3B1 gene mutation, whereas four cases (all RCMD) had no known mutations in splicing factor genes (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 or ZRSR2) (Supplementary Table S3), as determined by targeted next-generation sequencing data from a previous study.7  Total RNA was DNase treated (Invitrogen), purified using XP beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and processed (100 ng) using NEBNext Ultra directional mRNA Library prep (NEB, Hitchin, UK) as per the manufacturer's protocol for Illumina with two alterations: custom indexes were designed in house and an additional purification step was performed using XP beads (Beckman Coulter) rather than size selection. Samples were run on HiSeq2000 Illumina sequencing machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome using TopHat,26 which can handle reads spanning exon–exon boundaries. Data analysis was performed using edgeR27 to evaluate the whole transcript expression (false discovery rate<0.05) and with DEXSeq28 to evaluate differential exon usage (false discovery rate<0.05). At the expression level, only genes with at least 10 reads in four or more samples were included in the analysis; at the exon level, exons with fewer than 10 reads were excluded. Gender was included as an additional factor in the DEXSeq model testing for differential exon usage. Selected differentially expressed exons were validated using qRT-PCR (Supplemetary Figure S1, Supplementary Information). Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) v2.3 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) was used for visualization of the sequence reads. Pathway analysis was performed using IPA and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, as described above. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE63569.  Go to: Results SF3B1 knockdown inhibits cell growth, induces cell cycle arrest and impairs erythroid differentiation  SF3B1 was knocked down using siRNA technology in four myeloid cell lines (TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1) that we found to be wild type for SF3B1 (Supplementary Information), resulting in a significant decrease in expression ranging between 50 and 60% (Figure 1a).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting SF3B1 was compared with the corresponding cell line transfected with the scramble control. (a) SF3B1 mRNA expression measured 3 days after knockdown. (b ... Cell growth was inhibited in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown in comparison with the scramble control (Figure 1b). Cell cycle arrest in different phases was detected in different myeloid cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1c). K562 cells showed a significant G2M cell cycle arrest with a concomitant reduction in the percentage of cells in the G1 and S phase. TF1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase. HEL cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase and a significant increase in the sub-G1 cell population, indicating increased apoptosis. Similarly, SKM1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in S and G2M phase with a concomitant increase in the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 and G1 phase, indicating cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and an increase in apoptosis (Figure 1c).  Three cell lines (TF1, K562 and HEL) with SF3B1 knockdown were cultured with hemin to induce erythroid differentiation. We assessed the expression of the erythroid differentiation markers HBG1 and KLF1 using qRT-PCR. A significant reduction in the expression of HBG1 and KLF1 was observed in TF1 and K562 cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1d). In addition, we observed a reduction in the percentage of CD36+CD71+ and CD71+CD235a+ erythroid populations (significant for the CD36+CD71+ population) in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown compared with the scramble control (Figure 1e), suggesting that normal SF3B1 function is required for erythroid differentiation.17  RARS is characterized by FTMT accumulation and low expression levels of the iron transporter ABCB7.17, 29 We have previously shown that SF3B1 knockdown leads to decreased ABCB7 expression and increased FTMT expression in K562 cells.17 In this study, we have extended these observations to the other three myeloid cell lines investigated (Figure 2a). In addition, restoration of SF3B1 expression to normal levels after 10 days of culture was followed by restoration of ABCB7 expression levels to normal (Supplementary Figure S2).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown on gene expression and splicing. (a) ABCB7 and FTMT expression levels in TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1 cells with SF3B1 knockdown, as measured by qRT-PCR 48 h post transfection. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting ... Taken together, these data show that SF3B1 knockdown results in inhibition of cell growth, induction of cell cycle arrest and impairment of erythroid differentiation in myeloid cell lines.  SF3B1 knockdown alters gene expression  To evaluate the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on global gene expression, gene expression profiling was performed in the four myeloid cell lines. For each cell line, we compared the expression profiles of cells treated with two different siRNAs targeting SF3B1 with those of cells treated with a scramble control, 48 h post transfection.  We identified many genes that were up- or downregulated by >2-fold in each cell line treated with SF3B1 siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B). Four genes were upregulated (TFDP1, LOC100505759, MKRN1 and WRNIP1) and five genes were downregulated (ZC3H7A, CREBZF, SGK494, WSB1 and two probesets for SF3B1) in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  Pathway analysis was performed on the up- and downregulated genes in each cell line with SF3B1 knockdown using IPA. Significant deregulation of pathways related to cell cycle regulation was observed in all cell lines and of mTOR signaling and AMPK signaling pathways in three cell lines (Table 1). We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to identify pathways and processes showing coordinated up- or downregulation. Upregulated gene sets include p53 signaling in K562 and SKM1 cells, and several gene sets associated with regulation of transcription, spliceosome and splicing in K562 cells (Supplementary Table S4). Downregulated gene sets associated with the mitochondrial function were found in K562 and TF1 cells, and with cell cycle regulation in SKM1 and HEL cells (Supplementary Table S4). These data show that SF3B1 knockdown in the cell lines studied results in deregulation of many genes and pathways including cell cycle and RNA processing.  Table 1 Table 1 List of significant deregulated pathways in cell lines obtained using IPA SF3B1 knockdown impact on splicing  The genome-wide effects of SF3B1 knockdown on splicing were investigated in two myeloid cell lines (K562 and TF1) using human genome exon-junction arrays. The splicing profile of cells with SF3B1 knockdown (using two different siRNA per cell line) was compared with that of cells transfected with the scramble control.  We observed 2027 differentially expressed exons from 1419 genes, and 507 significant differentially regulated splicing variants (including exon skipping, intron retention and alternative splice sites) of 384 genes in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of CDC7 and SRSF11 in the data from both the cell lines, and of TP53 in TF1 cells. We found a significant overrepresentation of 3′ acceptor splice sites affected by alternative splicing events compared with 5′ donor splice sites (5:1 ratio, P=0.0027, χ2 test with Yates' correction), consistent with the known role of SF3B1 in the recognition of 3′ splice sites. Gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/), and many themes showed significant enrichment of genes affected at the level of exon usage and splice variants (Table 2). Cell cycle and RNA degradation were found to be consistently deregulated at both levels (Table 2). We investigated TP53 differential exon usage by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted bands. We observed exon skipping that was present in the SF3B1 knockdown cells only (Figure 2b).  Table 2 Table 2 Pathway analysis using human genome exon-junction array data at two different levels: differential exon usage and different splicing variant We also investigated whether two cell cycle genes (CCNA2 and STK6) previously shown to be aberrantly spliced in HeLa cells with SF3B1 knockdown,25 were also aberrantly spliced in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown in our study. Consistent with the finding in HeLa cells, we observed aberrant splicing of these genes using a qRT-PCR strategy as described previously (Figure 2c and d).25  RNA-Seq in HSPC from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations  To gain insight into the spectrum of genes that are deregulated or aberrantly spliced in association with SF3B1 mutation in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) of MDS patients, we used deep RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation (SF3B1 mutants), four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation (wild type) and five healthy controls (control) (Supplementary Table S3). Using IGV, we evaluated the expression of the SF3B1 alleles in SF3B1 mutant cases and observed a range of 45–52% of mutant allele frequency, indicating that both wild-type and mutant alleles were equally expressed (Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Figure S4).  We used edgeR to perform differential gene expression analysis of SF3B1 mutants versus wild type and control. At the whole transcript level, we observed a total of 526 genes (253 upregulated and 273 downregulated) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutants in comparison with wild type (Supplementary Table S5). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutants with control, we found 1823 significantly differentially expressed genes (646 upregulated and 1177 downregulated) (Supplementary Table S6). Genes linked to the pathogenesis of RARS and RCMD-RS, such as ALAS2 and ABCB7, were deregulated (ALAS2 upregulated and ABCB7 downregulated) in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. We also observed upregulation of the mitochondrial genes SLC25A37 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and GLRX5 in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control.  We performed an analysis using 121 genes either known to be expressed in erythroid cells30 or described as erythroid transcription factors in the literature. We found 42 differentially expressed genes (37 upregulated and 5 downregulated) when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control. These included heme biosynthetic enzymes (for example, ALAS2, ALAD, FECH and UROD), globin genes (for example, HBQ1, HBA2, HBB and HBA1) and transcription factors (for example, GATA1, GATA2 and KLF1). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we found a total of 32 differentially expressed genes (31 upregulated and 1 downregulated) of which 28 were overlapping with the differentially expressed genes found when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control.  We then performed pathway analysis on the significantly differentially expressed genes using IPA. Many pathways, including heme biosynthesis, mitotic roles of polo-like kinase and TNFR2 signaling, were significantly deregulated in the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type (Table 3). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with control, significantly deregulated pathways included apoptosis signaling, p53 signaling, cell cycle regulation and heme degradation (Supplementary Table S7). We next performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysisand many gene sets showing significant enrichment were identified in SF3B1 mutant versus wild type and control. Upregulated gene sets included several that were related to mitochondrial function, cell cycle checkpoints and mRNA splicing. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with control cases, downregulated gene sets included several that were related to cell differentiation and apoptosis (Supplementary Table S8). Many of these deregulated pathways and gene sets are relevant to the known pathophysiology of MDS and in particular of RARS and RCMD-RS.  Table 3 Table 3 Pathway analysis (IPA) of the significant differentially expressed genes between SF3B1 mutant and wild type obtained using edgeR DEXSeq was used to perform differential exon usage analysis of the RNAseq data to evaluate aberrantly spliced genes. At the exon level, we observed a total of 3506 exons (corresponding to 1924 genes) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (Table 4, Figure 3, Supplementary Table S9). Differential exon usage was observed in at least one exon of genes known to be involved in MDS pathophysiology (TP53 and EZH1), erythroid genes (ALAD, UROD and EPB42) and genes associated with cell cycle (AURKB and CRNDE) and RNA processing (RBM5, RBM25, PRPF40A and HNRNPD). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type cases, we found 3097 significantly differentially expressed exons (corresponding to 2022 genes) (Table 5, Figure 4, Supplementary Table S10). We found differential exon usage in at least one exon of genes involved in MDS pathophysiology (CBL, ASXL1 and DNMT3A), mitochondrial function (ALAS2, NDUFAF6), erythroid differentiation (NFE2L2, PPOX and HMBS) and mRNA processing (HNRNPD, U2AF2 and PRPF8). Interestingly, UQCC1, a gene involved in mitochondrial biogenesis31 and showing abnormal splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases in uveal melanoma,32 showed differential exon usage and upregulation in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with wild type and control in our study.

Table 4 Table 4 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and control, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq Table 5 Table 5 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and wild type, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq To identify pathways affected by differential exon usage, we performed pathway analysis on the genes showing significantly differentially expressed exons using IPA. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, we observed many pathways to be affected, including cell cycle, heme biosynthesis, DNA damage response, mitochondrial and haematopoietic progenitor cells pathway (Supplementary Table S11 and S12). Using DAVID functional annotation tool, we observed significant enrichment of biological themes including alternative splicing, RNA binding, mitochondrion, spliceosome and cell cycle.  Recently, a role for SF3B1 in the maintenance of genomic stability has also been reported where it functions in a DNA damage-induced mRNA splicing complex with BRCA1 and BCLAF1.33 Given that deregulation of the DNA damage response pathway was highlighted by the IPA pathway analysis, we performed an analysis using genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex. Several genes regulated by this complex showed differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (including NUMA1, RB1, CHUK and ABL1) and compared with wild type (NUMA1, PIAS1, SMAD4, BIRC2 and PTK2) (Supplementary Table S13). The overrepresentation of genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex was significant in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (P<0.001) and compared with wild type (P=0.0498, hypergeometric test). We also found many genes to be affected at the transcript level, including BIRC3, BCL2A1, GYPB, HBB and HBBP1 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control (Supplementary Table S13).  Go to: Discussion The identification of frequent somatic mutations of SF3B1 in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts suggests a direct correlation between the presence of mutations and this particular phenotype.2, 11, 13 However, the mechanism by which SF3B1 mutation leads to MDS with ring sideroblasts remains to be elucidated.  To illuminate the role of SF3B1 mutation in MDS pathophysiology, we have determined the effects of SF3B1 disruption on cell growth and gene expression in human hematological cells. First, we investigated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell function and gene expression in myeloid cell lines. Second, we used RNA-Seq to study the global gene expression changes and splicing abnormalities associated with the presence of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients.  We have shown that SF3B1 knockdown in four myeloid cell lines resulted in inhibition of cell growth and disruption of the cell cycle. It has recently been reported that Sf3b1+/− mice showed reduced numbers of HSC and compromised reconstitution capacity in lethally irradiated mice.14, 15 Thus, reduced expression of SF3B1 appears to result in impaired cell growth in hematopoietic cells. Similar observations have been made following reduced expression of other splicing factor genes, including U2AF1.3, 4, 34  We used two different microarray platforms to identify genes deregulated at the transcriptional and exon level by SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Gene expression profiling identified many deregulated genes, with four genes consistently upregulated, including TFDP1, and five genes downregulated, including CREBZF, in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown, several of which have a role in the control of cell growth. TFDP1 is involved in the control of transcriptional activity of G1/S cell cycle checkpoint genes,35 and CREBZF is a potent suppressor of cell growth, the effects of which are mediated through the tumor suppressor p53.36 Next, we employed exon-junction arrays to study the transcriptome in K562 and TF1 cells. We identified many differentially expressed exons and differentially regulated splicing variants in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of the CDC7 and SRSF11 genes, involved in cell cycle regulation and splicing, respectively, and of the TP53 gene. Several pathways including cell cycle, RNA processing, mitochondrion and apoptosis/p53 pathway were consistently deregulated in the cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  In summary, our data on myeloid cell lines suggest that the phenotype observed in cells with SF3B1 knockdown is mediated by aberrant splicing and expression of target genes involved in key biological processes.  RNA-Seq is the method of choice for a comprehensive analysis of global gene expression and splicing. In all relevant studies published to date, RNA-Seq has been performed on unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells from a small number of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations (n⩽3 per study), revealing interesting data.11, 37, 38 MDS arise in the HSC, and it is thus of critical importance that the effects of SF3B1 mutation on the transcriptome are studied in the cell of origin. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq on purified bone marrow CD34+ cells from 12 MDS patients, eight with ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutation and four without mutation in other splicing factor genes, and from five healthy controls.  We identified many significantly differentially expressed genes at the transcript level and the exon level when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. CD34+ cells from RCMD-RS and RARS patients display a particular expression profile of mitochondria-related genes;17, 20 we observed upregulation of ALAS2 (heme biosynthesis enzyme) and downregulation of ABCB7 (involved in the transport of iron from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm) in SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control, in agreement with our previous reports.17, 20 SLC25A37, encoding a mitochondrial iron importer, and GLRX5, encoding another mitochondrial protein, were both significantly upregulated in CD34+ cells of SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control. A recent study showed SLC25A37 mRNA upregulation in SF3B1 mutant bone marrow mononuclear cells of three MDS patients with RARS/-T.38 Evidence is thus mounting to suggest that upregulation of the iron importer SLC25A37 and downregulation of iron exporter ABCB7 may be linked to the increased mitochondrial iron accumulation observed in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts.39 Deregulation of these genes could also be consistent with an impaired ability of mitochondrial pathways to use iron that may result in an attempt to increase iron availability.  Importantly, we observed many genes associated with porphyrin and heme biosynthesis showing differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant cases, indicating altered splicing. These include ALAD and UROD when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and ALAS2 and PPOX when comparing with wild type. We suggest that the aberrant expression and exon usage of mitochondrial and heme-related genes in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation has a role in ring sideroblast formation and abnormal iron homeostasis observed in this patient group. Intriguingly, the most common congenital sideroblastic anemia (X-linked sideroblastic anemia) results from an ALAS2 mutation.40  The relative expression levels of the transcription factors GATA1 and GATA2 differed from normal in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation. The dynamic and strictly regulated change of expression from GATA2 to GATA1 during erythropoiesis has a crucial role,41 and any alteration of this pattern may be predicted to lead to aberrant erythropoiesis. We suggest that the aberrant expression and splicing of erythroid-related genes observed in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation may have a role in the ineffective erythropoiesis found in these patients.  In a previous study, RNA-Seq was used to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow mononuclear cells of two MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation to that of one healthy control.11 One hundred and thirty genes showed significant differential expression, 28 of which overlap with the genes differentially expressed between SF3B1 mutant and control in our study of CD34+ cells. These genes include MAP3K8 and CLEC5A, which have been previously shown to be downregulated in MDS.19, 42 Furthermore, 350 genes showed differential exon usage, and 52 of these were in common with the genes showing differential exon usage in our study of CD34+ cells. The overlapping genes include EZH1, ASXL1, CBL1 and SMAD4.  The mutant forms of ASXL1, CBL and TP53 are known to have an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of MDS, and intriguingly all these genes were found to be alternatively spliced in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  A recent study identified a DNA damage-induced BRCA1 protein complex containing BCLAF1 and SF3B1 (BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex).33 In response to DNA damage, the complex regulates pre-mRNA splicing of genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair and hence affects their transcription and pre-mRNA maturation.33 Importantly, we found many of the genes regulated by this complex to be differentially expressed and to show differential exon usage in our study. Genes showing differential transcript level changes included BIRC3 and BCL2A1, whereas NUMA1 showed differential exon usage when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we also found differential exon usage of the PIAS1 gene, a DNA damage response regulator.43, 44 It has been demonstrated that abrogation of members of this complex including BRCA1 and BCLAF1 results in genomic instability,33 a common feature of malignant cells. In MDS patients with mutant SF3B1, the function of this complex may be impaired, with possible downstream effects on the efficiency of DNA damage repair.  Many genes involved in RNA splicing and processing were found to show differential transcript levels, as well as differential exon usage in our study, including HNRNPD, U2AF2, PRPF8 and RBM25. A recent study showed RNA processing genes to be misspliced in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of MDS/AML patients with U2AF1 mutation.45 Intriguingly, there is limited overlap between the genes misspliced as a result of U2AF1 mutation and the RNA processing/splicing genes deregulated/aberrantly spliced in our SF3B1 mutant cases in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, suggesting that this process may be affected by different splicing mutations even if their target genes are distinct.  A recent study showed that defects in the splicing factor gene PRPF8 result in missplicing in myeloid malignancies and are associated with the presence of ring sideroblasts in advanced MDS and AML.46 Interestingly, we observed differential exon usage of PRPF8 in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with control in our study, indicating a link between SF3B1 and PRPF8 and the ring sideroblast phenotype. Our finding of differential exon usage of multiple RNA processing/splicing genes in the HSPC of cases with SF3B1 mutation points towards an exacerbation of aberrant splicing, with a wider number of downstream target genes affected. Emerging evidence from our study on SF3B1 and the study on U2AF145 thus supports the hypothesis that in MDS patients harboring splicing factor mutations, there is widespread disruption of the splicing machinery as a consequence of downstream effects of the mutant protein. Loss-of-function mutations in zebrafish Prpf8 have been shown to result in missplicing of TP53.47 We found TP53 to be aberrantly spliced in MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation compared with wild type and control.  Splicing factor mutations, including SF3B1, are considered to be founder mutations and must confer a selective growth advantage to the HSC, but how this occurs remains a mystery. We have identified differential splicing in several genes known to have a role in MDS pathogenesis, including TP53 and ASXL1, as well as genes involved in DNA damage repair, in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations. We suggest that the aberrant splicing of such genes may confer oncogenic properties that help drive the malignant process. In this study, we have determined the target genes of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients with ring sideroblasts, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying this phenotype.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and related disorders (myelodysplasia) comprise a group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by deregulated, dysplastic blood cell production and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)1 . Although the prevalence ofMDS has not been determined precisely, more than 10,000 people are estimated to develop myelodysplasia annually in the United States2 . Their indolent clinical course before leukaemic transformation and ineffective haematopoiesis with evidence of myeloid dysplasia indicate a pathogenesis distinct from that involved in de novo AML. Currently, a number of gene mutations and cytogenetic changes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS, including mutations of RAS, TP53 and RUNX1, and more recently ASXL1, c-CBL, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, TET2 and EZH2 (ref. 3). Nevertheless, mutations of this set of genes do not fully explain the pathogenesis of MDS because they are also commonly found in other myeloid malignancies and roughly 20% of MDS cases have no known genetic changes (ref. 4 and unpublished data). In particular, the genetic alterations responsible for the dysplastic phenotypes and ineffective haematopoiesis of myelodysplasia are poorly understood. Meanwhile, the recent development of massively parallel sequencing technologies has provided an expanded opportunity to discover genetic changes across the entire genomes or protein-coding sequences in human cancers at a single-nucleotide level5–10, which could be successfully applied to the genetic analysis of myelodysplasia to obtain a better understanding of its pathogenesis. Overview of genetic alterations In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of paired tumour/control DNA from 29 patients with myelodysplasia (Supplementary Table 1). Although incapable of detecting non-coding mutations and gene rearrangements, the whole-exome approach is a well-established strategy for obtaining comprehensive registries of protein-coding mutations at low cost and high performance. With a mean coverage of 133.8, 80.4% of the target sequences were analysed at more than 320 depth on average (Supplementary Fig. 1). All the candidates for somatic mutations (N 5 497) generated through our data analysis pipeline were subjected to validation using Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Methods I and Supplementary Fig. 2). Finally, 268 non-synonymous somatic mutations were confirmed with an overall true positive rate of 53.9% (Supplementary Fig. 3), including 206 missense, 25 nonsense, and 10 splice site mutations, and 27 frameshift-causing insertions/deletions (indels) (Supplementary Fig. 4). The mutation rate of 9.2 (0–21) per sample was significantly lower than that in solid tumours (16.2–302)7,11,12 and multiple myeloma (32.4)6 , but was comparable to that in AML (7.3–13)13–15 and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (11.5)16. Combined with the genomic copy number profile obtained by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array karyotyping, this array of somatic mutations provided a landscape of myelodysplasia genomes (Supplementary Fig. 5)17,18. 1 Cancer Genomics Project, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan. 2 Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 3 Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Manheim of the University of Heidelberg, 1–3 Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer, Mannheim 68167, Germany. 4 Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 5 Laboratory of Functional Genomics, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 6 Laboratory of Sequence Data Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 7 Division of Systems Biomedical Technology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 8 Nakauchi Stem Cell and Organ Regeneration Project, Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 9 Department of Hematology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8571, Japan. 10Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Ohtsuka Hospital, 2-8-1 Minami-Ohtsuka, Toshima-ku, Tokyo 170-0005, Japan. 11Division of Hematology, Internal Medicine, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, 1-30 Fujigaoka, Aoba-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 227-8501, Japan. 12Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich 81377, Germany. 13Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8700 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA. 14National University of Singapore, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, 28 Medical Drive, Singapore 117456, Singapore. 15Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University, 199 Tung Hwa North Rd, Taipei 105, Taiwan. *These authors contributed equally to this work. 64 | NATURE | VOL 478 | 6 OCTOBER 2011 ©2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved Novel gene targets in myelodysplasia The list of the somatic mutations (Supplementary Table 2) included most of the known gene targets in myelodysplasia with similar mutation frequencies to those previously reported, indicating an acceptable sensitivity of the current study. The mutations of the known gene targets, however, accounted for only 12.3% of all detected mutations (N 5 33), and the remaining 235 mutations involved previously unreported genes. Among these, recurrently mutated genes in multiple cases are candidate targets of particular interest, for which high mutation rates are expected in general populations. In fact, 8 of the 12 recurrently mutated genes were among the well-described gene targets in myelodysplasia (Supplementary Table 3). However, what immediately drew our attention were the recurrent mutations involving U2AF35 (also known as U2AF1), ZRSR2 and SRSF2 (SC35), because they belong to the common pathway known as RNA splicing. Including an additional three genes mutated in single cases (SF3A1, SF3B1 and PRPF40B), six components of the splicing machinery were mutated in 16 out of the 29 cases (55.2%) in a mutually exclusive manner (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2). Frequent mutations in splicing machinery RNA splicing is accomplished by a well-ordered recruitment, rearrangement and/or disengagement of a set of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes (U1, U2, and either U4/5/6 or U11/12), as well as many other protein components onto the pre-mRNAs. Notably, the mutated components of the spliceosome were all engaged in the initial steps of RNA splicing, except for PRPF40B, whose functions in RNA splicing are poorly defined. Making physical interactions with SF1 and a serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein, such as SRSF1 or SRSF2, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) that consists of the U2AF65 (U2AF2)– U2AF35 heterodimer, is involved in the recognition of the 39 splice site (39SS) and its nearby polypyrimidine tract, which is thought to be required for the subsequent recruitment of the U2 snRNP, containing SF3A1 as well as SF3B1, to establish the splicing A complex (Fig. 1)19. ZRSR2 (or Urp), is another essential component of the splicing machinery. Showing a close structural similarity to U2AF35, ZRSR2 physically interacts with U2AF65, as well as SRSF1 and SRSF2, with a distinct function from its homologue, U2AF35 (ref. 20). To confirm and extend the initial findings in the whole-exome sequencing, we studied mutations of the above six genes together with three additional spliceosome-related genes, including U2AF65, SF1 and SRSF1, in a large series of myeloid neoplasms (N 5 582) using a high-throughput mutation screen of pooled DNA followed by confirmation/identification of candidate mutations (refs 21 and 22 and Supplementary Methods II). In total, 219 mutations were identified in 209 out of the 582 specimens of myeloid neoplasms through validating 313 provisional positive events in the pooled DNA screen (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). The mutations among four genes, U2AF35 (N 5 37), SRSF2 (N 5 56), ZRSR2 (N 5 23) and SF3B1 (N 5 79), explained most of the mutations with much lower mutational rates for SF3A1 (N 5 8), PRPF40B (N 5 7), U2AF65 (N 5 4) and SF1 (N 5 5) (Fig. 2). Mutations of the splicing machinery were highly specific to diseases showing myelodysplastic features, including MDS either with (84.9%) or without (43.9%) increased ring sideroblasts, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (54.5%), and therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (25.8%), but were rare in de novo AML (6.6%) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (9.4%) (Fig. 3a). The mutually exclusive pattern of the mutations in these splicing pathway genes was confirmed in this large case series, suggesting a common impact of these mutations on RNA splicing and the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia (Fig. 3b). The frequencies of mutations showed significant differences across disease types. Surprisingly, SF3B1 mutations were found in the majority of the cases with MDS characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, that is, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) (19/23 or 82.6%) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia with $ 15% ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (38/50 or 76%) with much lower mutation frequencies in other myeloid neoplasms.

RNA splicing is initiated by the recruitment of U1 snRNP to the 59SS. SF1 and the larger subunit of the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF), U2AF65, bind the branch point sequence (BPS) and its downstream polypyrimidine tract, respectively. The smaller subunit of U2AF (U2AF35) binds to the AG dinucleotide of the 39SS, interacting with both U2AF65 and a SR protein, such as SRSF2, through its UHM and RS domain, comprising the earliest splicing complex (E complex). ZRSR2 also interacts with U2AF and SR proteins to perform essential functions in RNA splicing.

All rights reserved for 4.3% and 12.9% of MDS cases, respectively, where deregulated iron metabolism has been implicated in the development of refractory anaemia23. With such high mutation frequencies and specificity, the SF3B1 mutations were thought to be almost pathognomonic to these MDS subtypes characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, and strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS in these categories. Less conspicuously but significantly, SRSF2 mutations were more frequent in CMML cases (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Thus, although commonly involving the E/A splicing complexes, different mutations may still have different impacts on cell functions, contributing to the determination of discrete disease phenotypes. For example, studies have demonstrated that SRSF2 was also involved in the regulation of DNA stability and that depletion of SRSF2 can lead to genomic instability24. Of interest in this context, regardless of disease subtypes, samples with SRSF2 mutations were shown to have significantly more mutations of other genes compared with U2AF35 mutations (P 5 0.001, multiple regression analysis) (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, with a rare exception of A26V in a single case, the mutations of U2AF35 exclusively involved two highly conserved amino acid positions (S34 or Q157) within the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger motifs flanking the U2AF homology motif (UHM) domain. SRSF2 mutations exclusively occurred at P95 within an intervening sequence between the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and arginine/ serine-rich (RS) domains (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs 8 and 9). Similarly, SF3B1 mutations predominantly involved K700 and, to a lesser extent, K666, H662 and E622, which are also conserved across species (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 10). The involvement of recurrent amino acid positions in these spliceosome genes strongly indicated a gain-of-function nature of these mutations, which has been a welldocumented scenario in other oncogenic mutations25. On the other hand, the 23 mutations in ZRSR2 (Xp22.1) were widely distributed along the entire coding region (Fig. 2). Among these, 14 mutations were nonsense or frameshift changes, or involved splicing donor/acceptor sites that caused either a premature truncation or a large structural change of the protein, leading to loss-of-function. Combined with their strong male preference for the mutation (14/14 cases), ZRSR2 most likely acts as a tumour suppressor gene with an X-linked recessive mode of genetic action. The remaining nine ZRSR2 mutations were missense changes and found in both males (six cases) and females (three cases), whose somatic origin was only confirmed in two cases. However, neither the dbSNP database (build131 and 132) nor the 1000 Genomes database (May 2011 snp calls) contained these missense nucleotides, suggesting that many, if not all, of these missense changes are likely to represent functional somatic changes, especially those found in males. Interrogation of these hot spots for mutations in U2AF35 and SRSF2 found no mutations among lymphoid neoplasms, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (N 5 24) or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (N 5 87) (data not shown). RNA splicing and spliceosome mutations Because the splicing pathway mutations in myelodysplasia widely and specifically affect the major components of the splicing complexes E/A in a mutually exclusive manner, the common consequence of these mutations is logically the impaired recognition of 39SSs that would lead to the production of aberrantly spliced mRNA species. To appreciate this and also to gain an insight into the biological/biochemical impact of these splicing mutations, we expressed the wild-type and the mutant (S34F) U2AF35 in HeLa cells using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) marking (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Methods III) and examined their effects on gene expression in these cells using GeneChip Human genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix), followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Supplementary Methods IV)26. Intriguingly, the GSEA disclosed a significant enrichment of the genes on the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway among the significantly upregulated genes in mutant U2AF35-transduced HeLa cells (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 11a and Supplementary Table 7), which was SRSF2 (0.7%) PRPF40B (0.7%) SF3A1 (0.7%) Dup (0.7%) U2AF35 (1.9%) SRSF2 (1.9%) ZRSR2 (1.9%) PRPF40B (1.9%) SF1 (1.9%) MDS without RS (N = 155) RARS / RCMD-RS (N = 73) CMML (N = 88) De novo AML (N = 151) MPN (N = 53) b RARS/RCMD-RS CMML AML/MDS De novo AML MPN a ZR AML/MDS (N = 62) No mut (90.6%) U2AF35  (11.6%) SRSF2 (11.6%) ZRSR2 (7.7%) SF3B1 (6.5%) No mut (56.1%) SF3B1 (75.3%) No mut (15.1%) SRSF2 (5.5%) U2AF35  (8.0%) SRSF2 (28.4%) ZRSR2 (8.0%) SF3B1 (4.5%) SF3A1 (1.3% ) PRPF40B (1.9%) U2AF65 (0.6%) SF1 (1.3%) Dup (1.3%) Dup (2.7%) ZRSR2 (1.4%) Dup (3.4%) U2AF65 (1.1%) SF3A1 (1.1% ) No mut (74.2%) U2AF35  (9.7%) SRSF2  (6.5%) ZRSR2 (1.6%) SF3B1 (4.8%) SF3A1 (1.6% ) PRPF40B (1.6% ) No mut (93.4%) U2AF35 (1.3%) SF3B1 (2.6%) No mut (45.5%) MDS without RS SF3B1 SRSF2 U2AF35 ZRSR2 SF3A1 PRPF40B U2AF65 SF1 Figure 3 | Frequencies and distribution of spliceosome pathway gene mutations in myeloid neoplasms. a, Frequencies of spliceosome pathway mutations among 582 cases with various myeloid neoplasms. b, Distribution of mutations in eight spliceosome genes, where diagnosis of each sample is shown by indicated colours.

All rights reserved confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Methods 5V). A similar result was also observed for the gene expression profile of an MDS-derived cell line (TF-1) transduced with the S34F mutant (Supplementary Figs 11b, c). The NMD activation by themutant U2AF35was suppressed significantly by the cooverexpression of the wild-type protein (Supplementary Fig. 11d), indicating that the effect of the mutant protein was likely to be mediated by inhibition of thefunctions of the wild-type protein. Given that the NMD pathway, known as mRNA surveillance, provides a post-transcriptional mechanism for recognizing and eliminating abnormal transcripts that prematurely terminate translation27, the result of the GSEA analyses indicated that the mutant U2AF35 induced abnormal RNA splicing in HeLa and TF-1 cells, leading to the generation of unspliced RNA species having a premature stop codon and induction of the NMD activity. To confirm this, we next performed whole transcriptome analysis in these cells using the GeneChip Human exon 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix), in which we differentially tracked the behaviour of two discrete sets of probes showing different level of evidence of being exons, that is, ‘Core’ (authentic exons) and ‘non-Core’ (more likely introns) sets (Supplementary Methods IV and Supplementary Fig. 12). As shown in Fig. 4d, the Core and non-Core set probes were differentially enriched among probes showing significant difference in expression between wild-type and mutant-transduced cells (false discovery rate (FDR) 5 0.01). The Core set probes were significantly enriched in those probes significantly downregulated in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells compared with wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, whereas the non-Core set probes were enriched in those probes significantly upregulated in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4e). The significant differential enrichment was also demonstrated, even when all probe sets were included (Fig. 4f). Moreover, the significantly differentially expressed Core set probes tended to be up- and downregulated in wild-type and mutant U2AF35-transduced cells compared with mock-transduced cells, respectively, and vice versa for the differentially expressed non-Core set probes (Fig. 4e). Combined, these exon array results indicated that the wild-type U2AF35 correctly promoted authentic RNA splicing, whereas the mutant U2AF35 inhibited this processes, rendering non-Core and therefore, more likely intronic sequences to remain unspliced. The abnormal splicing in mutantU2AF35-transduced cells was more directly demonstrated by sequencing mRNAs extracted from HeLa cells, in which expression of the wild-type and mutant (S34F) U2AF35 were induced by doxycycline. First, after adjusting by the total number of mapped reads, the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells showed an increased read counts in the exon fraction, but reduced counts in other fractions, compared with mutant U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4g). The reads from the mutant-transduced cells were mapped to broader genomic regions compared with those from the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, which were largely explained by non-exon reads (Fig. 4h). Finally, the number of those reads that encompassed the authentic exon/intron junctions was significantly increased in mutantU2AF35-transduced cells compared withwild-type U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4i and Supplementary Methods VI). These results clearly demonstrated that failure of splicing ubiquitously occurred in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells. A typical example of abnormal splicing in mutant-transduced cells and the list of significantly unspliced exons are shown in Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 8, respectively. Biological consequence of U2AF35 mutations Finally, we examined the biological effects of compromised functions of the E/A splicing complexes. First, TF-1 and HeLa cells were transduced with lentivirus constructs expressing either the S34F U2AF35 mutant or wild-type U2AF35 under a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Figs 14a and 15a), and cell proliferation was examined after the induction of their expression. Unexpectedly, after the induction of gene expression with doxycycline, the mutant U2AF35-transduced cells, but not the wildtype U2AF35-transduced cells, showed reduced cell proliferation (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 15b) with a marked increase in the G2/M fraction (G2/M arrest) together with enhanced apoptosis as a 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.5 2.5 0.5 SMG5 DHX34 UPF1 SMG1 UPF3B BTZ UPF2 SMG7 SMG6 * * * * * * * * * 3.0 Mock S34F U2AF35  P < 0.01 (n = 5) b d 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 P = 0.0026 0.0 SMG5 SMG9 DHX34 UPF1 SMG1 UPF3B BTZ UPF2 SMG7 MAGOH SMG6 SMG8 Y14 eIF4A3 PYM UPF3A hNAG WT S34F Mock S34F WT U2AF35 AntiU2AF35 AntiFlag Anti- β actin HeLa S34F MockWT Normalized intensity S34F WT 10–1 10–3 101 100 10–2 S34F Mock Normalized intensity Enrichment score U2AF35 Hits cNormalized expression e f S.I.

To confirm the growth-suppressive effect of U2AF35 mutants in vitro, a highly purified haematopoietic stem cell population (CD342cKit1ScaI1Lin2, CD342KSL) prepared from C57BL/6 (B6)-Ly5.1 mouse bone marrow28 was retrovirally transduced with either the mutant (S34F, Q157P and Q157R) or wild-type U2AF35, or the mock constructs, each harbouring the EGFP marker gene (Supplementary Fig. 16). The ability of these transduced cells to reconstitute the haematopoietic system was tested in a competitive reconstitution assay. The transduced cells were mixed with whole bone marrow cells from B6-Ly5.1/5.2 F1 mice, transplanted into lethally irradiated B6-Ly5.2 recipients, and peripheral blood chimaerism derived from EGFPpositive cellswasassessed6 weeks after transplantation byflow cytometry. We confirmed that each recipient mouse received comparable numbers of EGFP-positive cells among the different retrovirus groups by estimating the percentage of EGFP-positive cells and overall proliferation in transduced cells by ex vivo tracking. Also no significant difference was observed in their homing capacity to bone marrow as assessed by transwell migration assays (Supplementary Fig. 17). As shown in Fig. 5e, the wild-typeU2AF35-transduced cells showed a slightly higher reconstitution capacity than the mock-transduced cells. On the other hand, the recipients of the cells transduced with the various U2AF35 mutants showed significantly lower EGFP-positive cell chimaerism than those of either the mock- or the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, indicating a compromised reconstitution capacity of the haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells expressing the U2AF35 mutants. In summary, these mutants lead to loss-of-function of U2AF35 most probably by acting in a dominant-negative fashion to the wild-type protein. Discussion Our whole-exome sequencing study unexpectedly unmasked a complexity of novel pathway mutations found in approximately 45% to 85% of myelodysplasia patients depending on the disease subtypes, which affected multiple but distinctive components of the splicing machinery and, as such, demonstrated the unquestionable power of massively parallel sequencing technologies in cancer research. The RNA splicing system comprises essential cellular machinery, through which eukaryotes can achieve successful transcription and guarantee the functional diversity of their protein species using alternative splicing in the face of a limited number of genes29. Accordingly, the meticulous regulation of this machinery should be indispensable for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis30, deregulation of which causes severe developmental abnormalities31,32. The current discovery of frequent mutations of the splicing pathway in myelodysplasia, therefore, represents another remarkable example that illustrates how cancer develops by targeting critical cellular functions. It also provides an intriguing insight into the mechanism of ‘cancer specific’ alternative splicing, which have long been implicated in the development of cancer, including MDS and other haematopoietic neoplasms33,34. In myelodysplasia, the major targets of spliceosome mutations seemed to be largely confined to the components of the E/A splicing complex, among others to SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF35 and ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent, to SF3A1, SF1, U2AF65 and PRPF40B. The broad coverage of the wide spectrum of spliceosome components in our exome sequencing was likely to preclude frequent involvement of other components on this pathway (Supplementary Fig. 18). The surprising frequency and specificity of these mutations in this complex, together with the mutually exclusive manner they occurred, unequivocally indicate that the compromised function of the E/A complex is a hallmark of this unique category of myeloid neoplasms, playing a central role in the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia. The close relationship between the mutation types and unique disease subtypes also support their pivotal roles in MDS. Given the critical functions of the E/A splicing complex on the precise 39SS recognition, the logical consequence of these relevant mutations would be the impaired splicing involving diverse RNA species. In fact, when expressed in HeLa cells, the mutant U2AF35 induced global abnormalities of RNA splicing, leading to increased production of transcripts having unspliced intronic sequences. On the other hand, the functional link between the abnormal splicing of RNA species and the phenotype of myelodysplasia is still unclear. Mutant U2AF35 seemed to suppress cell growth/proliferation and induce apoptosis rather than confer a growth advantage or promote clonal selection. ZRSR2 knockdown in HeLa cells has been reported to also result in reduced viability, arguing for the common consequence of these pathway mutations35. These observations suggested that the oncogenic actions of these splicing pathway mutations are distinct from what is expected for classical oncogenes, such as mutated kinases and signal transducers, but could be more related to cell differentiation. Of note in this regard, the commonest clinical presentation of MDS is severe cytopenia in multiple cell lineages due to ineffective haematopoiesis with increased apoptosis rather than unlimited cell proliferation1 . In this regard, lessons may be learned from the recent findings on the pathogenesis of the 5q2 syndrome, where haploinsufficiency of RPS14 leads to increased apoptosis of erythroid progenitors, but not myeloproliferation36,37.

All rights reserved pathogenesis of MDS, where the broad spectrum of RNA species affected by impaired splicing hampers identification of responsible gene targets. Moreover, the mutated components of the splicing machinery have distinct function of their own other than direct regulation of RNA splicing, involved in elongation and DNA stability, which may be important to determine specific disease phenotypes. Clearly, more studies are required to answer these questions through understanding of the molecular basis of their oncogenic actions. METHODS SUMMARY Whole-exome sequencing of paired tumour/normal DNA samples from the 29 patients was performed after informed consent was obtained. SNP array-based copy number analysis was performed as previously described17,18. Mutation analysis of the splicing pathway genes in a set of 582 myeloid neoplasms were performed by first screening mutations in PCR-amplified pooled targets from 12 individuals, followed by validation/identification of the candidate mutations within the corresponding 12 individuals by Sanger sequencing. Flag-tagged cDNAs of the wild-type and mutant U2AF35 were generated by in vitro mutagenesis, constructed into a murine stem cell virus-based retroviral vector as well as a tetracycline-inducible lentivirus-based expression vector, and used for gene transfer to CD342KSL cells and cultured cell lines, with EGFP marking, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from wild-type or mutant U2AF35-transduced HeLa and TF-1 cells, and analysed on microarrays. RNA sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Cell proliferation assays (MTT assays) on HeLa and TF-1 cells stably transduced with lentivirus U2AF35 constructs were performed in the presence or absence of doxycycline. For competitive reconstitution assays, CD342KSL cells collected from C57BL/6 (B6)- Ly5.1 mice were retrovirally transduced with various U2AF35 constructs with EGFP marking, and transplanted with competitor cells (B6-Ly5.1/5.2 F1 mouse origin) into lethally irradiated B6-Ly5.2 mice 48 h after gene transduction. Frequency of EGFP-positive cells was assessed in peripheral blood by flow cytometry 6 weeks after the transplantation (Supplementary MethodsVII). The primer sets used for validation of gene mutations and qPCR of NMD gene expression are listed in Supplementary Tables 9211. A complete description of the materials and methods is provided in the Supplementary Information.

128||The RNA maturation is an important and complex biological process. It requires several small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that comprise the two forms of spliceosomes. The major form of spliceosome (U2-type) is composed of U1, U2, U4/6 and U5 snRNPs, and catalyzes most splicing events in metazoans.1  Mutations of genes, such as SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent SF1, SF3A1, U2AF2 or PRPF40B, encoding spliceosome compounds have been found to occur at high frequencies in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).2, 3, 4 Subsequently, SF3B1 mutations were also found in solid tumors such as endometrial, lung, bladder, pancreatic and breast carcinomas and cutaneous melanomas.5 We and others also reported that 15–20% of uveal melanoma (UM) carry SF3B1 mutations.6, 7, 8 SF3B1 (splicing factor 3 B subunit 1, also named SF3B155) is a central compound the U2 snRNP complex in direct contact with the branch site of the pre-mRNA. SF3B1 contains 22 HEAT repeats (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, Targets of rapamycin 1). Major hotspots of missense mutations of SF3B1 target one of the HEAT repeats at positions R625, K666 and K700, with variability according to diseases, R625 and K700 mutations being the most prevalent in UM and hematologic disorders, respectively. Prognosis value of these mutations vary according to diseases, SF3B1 mutations are associated with poor outcomes in CLL and favorable outcomes in UM.9 SF3B1 mutations are especially associated with the refractory anemia with excess of ring sideroblasts (RARS), a mild form of MDS with little impact on patient’s survival. Consequences of these mutations on splicing are less clear. Aberrant splicing associated with SF3B1 was reported by two landmark publications.2, 3 However, little overlap was found between MDS and CLL. Furthermore, Harbour et al.6 found no splicing effect of SF3B1 mutations in a series of UM patients analyzed by RNA-seq. By combining exon array and RNA-seq analyzes, we recently reported alternative transcripts of eight genes statistically associated with SF3B1 R625 mutations and linked to various RNA processing mechanisms: alternative terminal exons (UQCC, ADAM12, GAS8), alternative 3′ acceptor splice sites (CRNDE, ANKHD1), alternative cassette exons (GUSBP1), alternative first exon (F8) and intron retention (ABCC5).7  Five of these differential splicing events (CRNDE, GUSBP11, UQCC, ABCC5 and ANKHD1) were most consistently associated with the SF3B1-mutated status. Here we explored whether this splicing signature was also associated with SF3B1 mutations in malignancies other than UM, namely in MDS and CLL.  Series of CLL (26 cases), MDS of various subtypes (48 cases) and UM (87 cases) were assembled. These samples were genotyped for the recurrent mutated genes of the spliceosome, and biological and clinical data were obtained (see Supplementary Table for sample characteristics). After RNA extraction and reverse transcription, samples were analyzed for the two splice forms of UQCC, CRNDE, ANKHD1, GUSBP1 and ABCC5 by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) as described previously.7 CRNDE was poorly expressed in CLL, below the detection sensitivity of the RT-QPCR in most cases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied on the splicing ratio of the five expressed genes obtained for the series of MDS and CLL data, as well as with that of the series of UM previously reported.7 Whereas no disease aggregation was observed in the clustering, all SF3B1-mutated samples clustered in a single branch (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table for complete sample status). More specifically, this group of samples included 8 CLL SF3B1-mutated samples (K700E (6), K666T (1) and G742D (1)), 24 MDS SF3B1-mutated sample cases (K700E (14), H622Q (4), D781G (2), R625L/H/D/C (4)) and 19 SF3B1-mutated UM samples (R625H/C/L/P (16), K666M/T (2), K700E (1)). As expected, most SF3B1-mutated MDS were classified as RARS or refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (16 and 4, respectively out of 23 cases). No SF3B1-mutated samples were misclassified, except one MDS sample, MDS44 and one UM case, UM48, with low but detectable frequencies of mutated SF3B1 allele, which segregated with wild-type cases. Five cases without detected splicesome mutations (one MDS, two UM and two CLL) clustered in this branch corresponding to the mutated samples. The three SRSF2-mutated MDS cases, bearing the P95H hotspot mutation, segregated in the second branch with the wild-type samples, suggesting that this mutant-splicing factor differently affects the splicing process than the SF3B1 mutants. Two MDS samples bearing ZRSR2 missense mutations of unknown functional consequences (K413E and V304M) segregated each in a different branch.  Figure 1.

An unsupervised hierarchical clustering and a heatmap are performed using the difference in Ct (threshold cycle) between the two splicing forms expression for the five genes, measured by RT-QPCR for a series of 161 tumor samples representing 3 pathologies: uveal melanoma (UM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Data were normalized on mean and standard deviation within each pathology and research center. Clustering was performed based on Euclidian distance by Ward’s method.

NA, not available.  Full figure and legend (124K)  Several conclusions could be drawn from these results. First, it is the first time that consistent splicing abnormalities are associated with SF3B1 mutations. The fact that the same splicing pattern is observed in tumor cells from different lineages and embryonic origins, strongly argues for a direct consequence of SF3B1 mutation. Second, the same pattern is observed irrespective of the mutated HEAT repeats of SF3B1. The reason for different hotspot mutations in different malignancies is largely unexplained but no different consequence was detected in the limited splicing events explored here. Third, the other mutated spliceosome compounds present in our series, including SRSF2 and ZRSR2, did not share the splicing abnormalities of the SF3B1 mutants. Finally, while no false negative was present in the clustering, the splicing pattern of 5 out of 161 samples from the three series was undistinguishable from that of SF3B1 samples, suggesting either experimental limitation of our splicing analysis or undetected abnormalities of the splicing machinery.  Our data clearly associate specific splicing abnormalities to SF3B1 mutations but these abnormalities are most probably not limited to those analyzed here. To statistically demonstrate splicing variants among more than 200 000 different splicing events remains challenging. It requires reliable molecular tools such as the latest generation of exon array or RNA-seq, efficient bioinformatics and large series of cases. It is thus likely that only the most consistent events were picked by the analysis of a limited number of mutated cases. Splicing forms yet to be discovered may better explain the oncogenic pathways activated by mutant SF3B1. Finally, our results do not rule out functions of SF3B1 besides splicing, which deregulations could intervene in oncogenesis.   Graphical Abstract Image for unlabelled figure Figure options  Introduction RNA splicing, a highly regulated molecular event orchestrated by the spliceosome, involves the removal of intronic sequences from pre-mRNA and the ligation of exons to generate mature mRNA (Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009). This process can result in multiple mRNAs being produced from a single gene providing increased protein diversity in cells. Dysregulation of RNA splicing has been identified as a causative defect in several diseases (Dehm, 2013 ;  Singh and Cooper, 2012). Furthermore, dysregulated alternative splicing has been proposed to play an important role in tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy; however, in many cases, the molecular consequences of dysregulated splicing in cancer have remained largely elusive (Zhang and Manley, 2013). Recently, recurrent heterozygous mutations were identified in components of the spliceosome in various tumor types suggesting that somatic mutations in spliceosome genes play an important role in cancer (Yoshida and Ogawa, 2014). SF3B1 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene with particular enrichment in diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, uveal melanoma (UVM), skin melanoma (SKCM), and breast (BRCA) and pancreatic cancers ( Biankin et al., 2012; Ellis et al., 2012; Harbour et al., 2013; Kong et al., 2014; Landau et al., 2013; Malcovati et al., 2015 ;  Yoshida et al., 2011). Based on the high frequency of SF3B1 mutations and the key role in splicing of this protein, we sought to study the molecular and functional consequences of SF3B1 hotspot mutations on RNA splicing in cell lines and patient samples.  Splicing takes place after the recognition of consensus sequences near the 5′ and 3′ ends of introns, known as 5′ and 3′ splice sites (ss), by the splicing machinery. U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) recognizes the 5′ ss, whereas U2 snRNP is directed to the appropriate 3′ ss by short, conserved pre-mRNA sequences, including a branch point sequence (BPS), the polypyrimidine (Py) tract, and the AG dinucleotide at the intron-exon junction. Prior to U2 snRNP recruitment, SF1 recognizes the BPS, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) large subunit (U2AF2) recognizes the Py tract, and U2AF small subunit (U2AF1) recognizes the AG dinucleotide. Subsequently, the U2 snRNP replaces SF1 in an ATP-dependent process that facilitates protein and RNA rearrangements. In particular, the N terminus of SF3B1, a U2 snRNP component, has been shown to bind with U2AF2, whereas the SF3B1 C terminus along with another U2 snRNP component, p14, interacts with the BPS and nearby pre-mRNA sequences (Gozani et al., 1998). In addition, U2 snRNP and pre-mRNA complex is stabilized by a base-paired duplex between the U2 snRNA and the BPS. The subsequent binding of U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP induces structural rearrangements that lead to activation of two catalytic steps that generate the lariat intermediate and subsequent final exon-exon product (Horowitz, 2012; Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009).  The recurrent hotspot mutations in SF3B1 are found exclusively in the C-terminal HEAT domains (residues 622–781; Figure S1A). Though there has been lack of structural information on how SF3B1 interacts with pre-mRNA, previous cryo-electron microscopy studies suggest that SF3B1 may undergo a conformational change to a more open form that enables mRNA binding and BPS recognition by the U2 snRNP (Golas et al., 2003). Although it was previously reported by several groups that SF3B1 mutant-positive cancers are associated with aberrant splicing (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013), here, we show that SF3B1 hotspot mutations (SF3B1MUT) result in neomorphic activity causing aberrant splicing. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ ss selection through the use of a branch point (BP) different from the BP utilized by SF3B1 wild-type (SF3B1WT) and that SF3B1MUT still requires the canonical Py tract for the formation of the active spliceosome to induce aberrant splicing. We predict that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced mRNAs are subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that multiple aberrant transcripts are degraded, resulting in downregulation of the associated canonical protein in cell line models and patient samples. These insights into the splicing aberrations induced by SF3B1MUT will enable discovery of downstream consequences that contribute to neoplasms and the discovery of targeted therapeutic approaches for SF3B1MUT cancers.  Results SF3B1MUT Tumor-Specific Splicing Defects  To provide a more complete understanding of the splicing aberrations observed in SF3B1MUT cancers, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from different tumor types were analyzed using a bioinformatic pipeline that we developed in order to quantify exon-exon junctions without the need of predetermined alternative splicing models or annotated splice junctions. The analysis pipeline was applied to CLL patient samples (7 SF3B1MUT and 6 SF3B1WT) and a number of samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas: luminal A primary BRCA (7 SF3B1K700E and 14 SF3B1WT), SKCM (3 SF3B1MUT and 12 SF3B1WT), and UVM (18 SF3B1MUT and 18 SF3B1WT) (Table S1). This analysis revealed 895 aberrant splice junctions to be significantly upregulated in SF3B1MUT compared to SF3B1WT of which 534 events (∼60%) were unique as they had not been previously annotated in major transcriptome databases. The majority of aberrant splicing events observed were aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures 1A and S1B; Table S2), consistent with previous observations (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013).

Box plots and whiskers are represented as per the Tukey method. See also Figure S1 and Tables S2 and S3. Figure options Unsupervised clustering was applied to the identified aberrant junctions and it led to clustering of SF3B1MUT samples distinct from the cluster of SF3B1WT samples (Figure 1B), with the exception of two SF3B1MUT samples (TCGA-D8-A1JH and TCGA-ER-A19S) that clustered with the SF3B1WT samples. This was likely driven by low mutant allele fractions (7% and 14%, respectively) when compared with a range of 25%–52% for other samples (Figure 1B; Table S2). Moreover, samples with SF3B1MUT clustered within each tumor type (BRCA, SKCM, UVM, and CLL), each showing a set of unique aberrantly spliced junctions (Figures 1B and S1C). A set of “common” events (i.e., events found in all tumor types) were observed, consistent with a small overlap of splicing abnormalities found in CLL and UVM described in two previous reports (Furney et al., 2013). The pattern of tumor-specific splicing in BRCA and CLL could, at least in part, be explained by the increased expression of the genes that are aberrantly spliced in these tumor types compared to the other diseases (p = 7.5022 × 10−05 and p = 1.0078 × 10−36, respectively); however, the same was not observed for SKCM and UVM (Figure 1C; Table S3). This suggests that additional mechanisms, such as tissue-specific splicing regulation, might contribute to these patterns.  Using the aberrant junctions identified in the previous analysis, we extended the clustering analysis to include 14 MDS RARS samples (12 SF3B1MUT) and an additional 19 samples from TCGA with miscellaneous SF3B1 mutations (Table S1). For the MDS samples, relatively low sequencing depth and inclusion of just two SF3B1WT samples precluded their use for the discovery of MDS-specific aberrant junctions. While all SF3B1MUT MDS patients and three BRCA patients (p.N626D, p.D781E, and p.K666E) clustered with the original SF3B1MUT sample set, 16 SF3B1 mutant patients clustered with SF3B1WT samples (Figure S1D). These patient samples carried mutations in SF3B1 (“Non-hotspot” in Figure S1D and Table S1) that are not co-localized with the hotspot mutations in the HEAT domain. These analyses strongly suggest a convergence of mechanism and downstream splicing effects induced by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1 Mutations Induce Aberrant mRNA Splicing in Human and Mouse Cells  To study SF3B1MUT in vitro, a pancreatic cancer cell line carrying endogenous SF3B1 mutations (Panc05.04: p.Q699H and p.K700E) was utilized. In addition, the p.K700E, p.K666N, or p.H662Q mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E, Nalm-6 SF3B1K666N, Nalm-6 SF3B1H662Q) or a synonymous mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700K, referred as SF3B1WT) was introduced by AAV-mediated homology to the Nalm-6 pre-B cell line to produce isogenic matched cell lines. Unsupervised clustering of these cell lines and a panel of several SF3B1WT pancreatic cancer cell lines using the aberrant splice junctions identified in patient samples resulted in clear segregation of SF3B1MUT cell lines from SF3B1WT cells (Figure 2A). A similar increase in aberrant splice junctions observed in RNA-seq data analysis was confirmed in Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells using a Nanostring assay developed to quantify aberrant splice junctions (Figure S2A). Panc05.04 cells carry the hotspot mutation p.K700E and a mutation at position 699 (p.Q699H) that is not observed in patient samples. When the p.Q699H and p.K700E were expressed alone or in combination in 293FT cells, only cells expressing p.K700E and p.Q699H/p.K700E induced aberrant splicing indicating that p.Q699H does not appear to affect this aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures S2B and S2C). These data confirm that Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1MUT cell lines are representative models to study the splicing functional activity of SF3B1MUT in vitro.

Data are represented as mean of three biological replicates. Data are presented in box plots as boxes in the first and third quartiles, midline as the median, and whiskers extending to the range excluding outliers. See also Figure S2. Figure options To confirm that additional cancer-associated SF3B1 hotspot mutations induced aberrant splicing, we expressed various mxSF3B1MUT, mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R in 293FT cells (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for a description of mxSF3B1; Figure S2D) and analyzed splicing aberrations by Nanostring. The p.K700R mutation served as a negative control as it doesn’t introduce a major change in charge or size of the amino acid and is not disease associated. All SF3B1MUT tested demonstrated the same usage of aberrant splice sites observed in endogenous and engineered cell lines; however, the SF3B1K700R or SF3B1WT did not show these splicing changes (Figure 2B). Moreover, the expression of any of the SF3B1 constructs did not change the overall expression (sum of aberrant and canonical) of affected genes (Figure 2B). To further confirm the correlation between expression of SF3B1 p.K700E mutation and aberrant splicing, tetracycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to selectively knockdown (KD) the SF3B1MUT or SF3B1WT allele in Panc05.04 and Panc10.05 (SF3B1MUT and SF3B1WT cells). After confirmation of KD efficiency (Figures S2E–S2H), RNA isolated from treated cells was analyzed by Nanostring. Depletion of the SF3B1MUT allele in Panc05.04 resulted in downregulation of aberrant splice isoforms, whereas an accumulation of aberrant splice isoforms was observed with selective SF3B1WT allele depletion (Figures 2C and 2D), indicating that SF3B1MUT was responsible for the appearance of aberrant splicing. These results were also supported by the expression of a pan shRNA or depletion of SF3B1WT in the Panc10.05 where no effect on aberrant splicing was observed (Figures 2C and 2D). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT acquires a neomorphic function and may also lose wild-type splicing activity. This observation was also supported by the recent paper by Zhou et al. proposing that in a different SF3B1 mutant cell line (ESS1) wild-type SF3B1 was required for survival (Zhou et al., 2015).  SF3B1MUT Recognizes a Cryptic 3′ AG with a Short and Weak Py Tract  The most common splicing abnormality observed in SF3B1MUT cells was the usage of an aberrant 3′ ss. To understand the sequence features and the mechanism by which mutant SF3B1 would induce aberrant splicing, computational analysis of SF3B1MUT patient data and minigene assay validation methods were utilized. First, an enrichment of the cryptic AGs was determined to be located between −15 and −24 nt upstream of the canonical 3′ ss in SF3B1MUT patient samples (Figure 3A). In contrast, the first AG (but not GAG) upstream of a canonical AG in RefSeq showed a much lower density in this region and a wider distribution. Interestingly, the motif sequences associated with the cryptic and canonical AGs showed several different features. Upstream of the canonical AGs, a clear enrichment of pyrimidines was observed in agreement with the presence of a Py tract, whereas the cryptic AGs were associated with a short and weak Py tract and an enrichment of adenines (A) that are possibly important for BPS selection. In contrast, no clear features were associated with the first upstream AGs in RefSeq (Figures 3B and S3). Interestingly, similar features, such as the position of cryptic AG between −15 and −24, the presence of a short and weak Py tract, and an enrichment of As were observed in aberrant 3′ spliced junctions detected in NIH 3T3 mouse cells overexpressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures S4A–S4C). While similar features associated with aberrant splice junction usage were observed in mxSF3B1K700E mouse cells, the overlap of affected junctions observed in human cells was low due to low sequence similarity of introns between species (Figure S4D; Table S4). An exception was observed for the UXS1 gene for which the junction between exon 2 and exon 3 is conserved among different species ( Figure S4E). These data strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant splicing in the presence of competing 3′ ss via a sequence-dependent feature located within the intron and preferentially recognizes cryptic splice sites with weaker Py tract in close proximity to an enrichment of As.

Shown here is a representative ethidium-bromide-stained 2.5% agarose gel of the indicated RT-PCR reactions of mRNA isolated from transfected cells. See also Figures S4 and S5 and Table S4. Figure options To confirm the importance of these specific sequence features, we selected the exon 9/exon 10 junction in ZDHHC16 to develop a minigene as it was observed to be aberrantly spliced among all the SF3B1 hotspot mutant samples analyzed. In addition, several alterations in the cryptic 3′ ss, the length/strength of the Py tracts, and the potential BPS were tested ( Figure S5A). Splicing was assessed by RT-PCR using cDNA prepared from 293FT cells co-transfected with ZDHHC16 minigene and mxSF3B1 plasmid. As expected, when the ZDHHC16 exon 9, intron 9 and exon 10 (E9-I9-E10) minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, only canonical splicing was observed, whereas in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E and all the other hotspot mutations, both canonical and aberrant splicing was detected (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 4 and 5; Figure S5B). Interestingly, once the cryptic AG was removed (E9-I9NoAG-E10), aberrant splicing was not observed even in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that the cryptic AG is necessary for aberrant splicing. To understand whether exonic sequences play a role in aberrant splicing, we looked at the preceding junction in ZDHHC16 (E8-I8-E9). As expected, no aberrant splicing was observed when this minigene was co-transfected with any of the mxSF3B1 constructs (Figure 3D, lanes 10 and 11). Canonical and aberrant splicing was detected when intron 8 between exon 8 and 9 was replaced with intron 9 (E8-I9-E9) in the ZDHHC16 minigene and co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, but not when co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R (Figure 3D, lanes 12 and 13). These results agree with the computational analysis suggesting that the cryptic AG is necessary and the intronic features are sufficient to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  Identification of the 3′ ss occurs during early assembly of the spliceosome, in particular when the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex recognizes the Py tract and AG, and then again when the AG is recognized during the second step of splicing (Horowitz, 2012). To understand if the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is sufficient to recruit the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex, the length/strength of the canonical Py tract was reduced from 19 nt to 10, 6, and 2 nt (PyT 10n, PyT 6n, and PyT 2n, respectively) or the weak and short cryptic Py tract was replaced with a strong Py tract (SELEX) (Figure S5A) (Lim et al., 2011). When the minigene PyT 2n (or PyT 10n and PyT 6n, in Figure S5C) was co-transfected with the mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, the splicing event occurred with selection of a new cryptic 3′ ss within exon 10 positioned 54 nt downstream of the canonical 3′ ss (sequencing data not shown), suggesting that the PyT 2n was not recognized by U2AF complex (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15; Figure S5C). This is in agreement with previous reports suggesting that Py tract length and strength are necessary for the recruitment of U2AF2/U2AF1 to guide splicing to occur at that position (Coolidge et al., 1997). Surprisingly, when the same minigenes were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, similar results were observed and splicing occurred within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15), suggesting that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is not sufficient to recruit the U2AF complex and that the cryptic AG requires the downstream canonical Py tract to induce aberrant splicing. The nucleotide base upstream of the AG dinucleotide has been reported to be critical for U2AF1 interaction in early recognition of 3′ ss and is usually a T/C in consensus sequences (Ilagan et al., 2015). Hence, introduction of a G upstream of the canonical or cryptic AG (−3 T > G or −24 C > G) would potentially abolish their use as a 3′ ss, respectively. When −3 T > G minigene was co-transfected with either mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E constructs, splicing was observed within exon 10, similar to PyT 2n, suggesting again that the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex needs to be recruited at the canonical AG during first step of splicing to allow usage of the cryptic AG by SF3B1MUT (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 16 and 17). Interestingly, when −24 C > G minigene was used, only canonical splicing was observed, even after mxSF3B1K700E expression (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 8 and 9). These data suggest that the −3 position relative to cryptic AG is also important when the cryptic 3′ ss is recognized during the second transesterification reaction of splicing. Moreover, when the short and weak cryptic Py tract was replaced with a SELEX Py tract, the cryptic AG was used as the preferred 3′ ss by cells expressing both mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 18 and 19). Taken together, these data support the notion that the sequence features required by SF3B1MUT-containing U2 snRNP complex are located within the intron and that the cryptic AG and the downstream canonical Py tract are required to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1MUT Utilizes a Different BPS  The computational analysis of motifs near the 3′ ss showed an enrichment of As upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse mutant SF3B1 cells, suggesting the importance of this sequence for the SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 complex. DeBoever and colleagues suggested that these were the BPSs for the mutant and wild-type SF3B1 complexes using a BPS prediction algorithm (DeBoever et al., 2015). Instead, we used the recently mapped BPS data using K562 SF3B1WT cells and overlaid these data with introns in which the aberrant splice junctions were observed in SF3B1MUT cells (Mercer et al., 2015). A total of 151 BPs were mapped among 93 introns; 60 introns have only one identified BP, and another 33 introns contain multiple reported BPs. The distribution of these BPs with respect to the cryptic AG indicated that the majority of BPs overlapped with the A of the cryptic AG or were in close proximity (between 1, cryptic A and −5), but did not coincide with the enrichment of As observed in the motif analysis (Figure 4A). The enrichment of As was observed between −8 and −18 nt upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse cells expressing mutant SF3B1 (Figures 4B and S4C). This suggests that these As could play an important role for SF3B1MUT function. To test this hypothesis, the 3 As located between −33 and −35 were mutated to Gs in the ZDHHC16 minigene (−33 to −35 AAA > GGG; Figure 4C and S5A). When this minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT and mxSF3B1K700R, canonical splicing was observed, suggesting that these As are not part of the BPS for wild-type U2 complex (Figure 4D, lanes 11 and 12). Instead, when the cells were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, canonical splicing was observed without any aberrant splicing, indicating that the three As are probably part of the BPS used by the U2 mutant complex (Figure 4D, lane 12). To identify the BPS used by the U2 wild-type complex, the A at position −26 and −30 alone or together were mutated to G (−26 A > G, −30 A > G and −26, −30 AA > GG; Figure 4C). When the A at position −26 alone or both −26 and −30 were mutated to G and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, splicing was observed within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10), suggesting that this is likely the BPS for SF3B1WT, but not for SF3B1K700E, as canonical and aberrant splicing was observed in these conditions (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10). Interestingly, when the minigene with the A at position −30 alone was mutated to G (Figure 4C and S5A) and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R splicing was observed mostly within exon 10 and when co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, only aberrant splicing was observed (Figure 4D, lanes 7 and 8). As expected, when all the As were mutated to Gs (all A > G, Figures 4C and S5A), each mxSF3B1 construct spliced within exon 10 (Figure 4D, lanes 13 and 14). Additionally, this outcome was confirmed by mapping the two different BPs using nested PCR analysis and sequencing of endogenous ZDHHC16 intron 9 lariat in K562 isogenic cells ( Figure 4E). Unlike in SF3B1WT cells, we observed at least two major templates with different sequences in the SF3B1K700E cells due to a mixed population of SF3B1WT and SF3B1MUT proteins. Through analysis and matching of expected transcript sequences using Mutation Surveyor, we found that −34 A and −30 A were the BPs used for SF3B1K700E and SF3B1WT, respectively. To extend our observation, we also mapped BPs in four additional genes that are aberrantly spliced in presence of SF3B1K700E: TMEM14C (intron 1), SEPT6 (intron 9), DLST (intron 5), and DIP2A (intron 23) ( Table S5). These results prove that the SF3B1 wild-type and mutant-containing U2 complexes are able to use two different BPs.  SF3B1MUT Uses a Different BPS than SF3B1WT(A) Relative positions of mapped BP ... Figure 4.  SF3B1MUT Uses a Different BPS than SF3B1WT (A) Relative positions of mapped BP (n = 151) from Mercer et al. compared to the location of cryptic AGs identified in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells (Mercer et al., 2015).

Figure options Aberrant Transcripts Generated by SF3B1MUT Are Subjected to NMD  Erroneous or aberrant mRNAs that contain a premature termination codon are subjected to NMD to prevent potential deleterious effects of their translation to proteins (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Computational analysis revealed that the majority of cryptic AGs were located upstream of canonical 3′ ss at nucleotide distances that were not multiples of 3 (Figure 5A). This result suggested that the aberrant transcripts would have a higher probability to be out of frame and therefore degraded by NMD. To confirm that predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts were degraded by the NMD pathway, RNA-seq was performed on Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells treated with cycloheximide, a translation inhibitor known to inhibit NMD (Singh et al., 2012). Bioinformatic prediction analysis revealed that 44% of all aberrant mRNAs identified in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cell lines would result in an NMD-sensitive transcript (Rivas et al., 2015) (Figure 5B; Tables S6 and S7). RNA-seq analysis from Nalm-6 isogenic cells demonstrated that NMD-sensitive genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E than Nalm-6 SF3B1WT (p = 1.06 × 10−12), whereas predicted NMD-insensitive genes were expressed at similar levels (Figure 5C). RNA-seq analysis identified 41 predicted NMD-sensitive genes to be both downregulated in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E and to have increased abundance following cycloheximide treatment (Figure 5D; Table S6), suggesting that these aberrant transcripts were degraded by the NMD. In addition, to evaluate if this would result in downregulation of the associated canonical protein, stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) with subsequent mass spectrometry was used to quantify protein levels in Nalm-6 isogenic lines (Oda et al., 1999)· Eleven predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts for which peptides could be detected in Nalm-6 SF3B1WT were selected for evaluation, and ten were found to have decreased peptide counts by at least 2- to 8-fold (e.g., ABCB7, AKAP8L; Figure 6A). Decreased expression of canonical proteins was confirmed by western blot analysis using available antibodies, such as MZB1, PHGDH, and SEPT6 (Figure 6B). Among the downregulated proteins in the SILAC experiment were two proteins of particular interest: MZB1 and ABCB7. MZB1 is a B cell-specific and ER-localized protein implicated in antibody secretion and integrin-mediated cell adhesion (van Anken et al., 2009). As shown in Figure 6C, MZB1 was aberrantly spliced in SF3B1K700E cells and the canonical isoform was clearly downregulated at transcript and protein level (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6D). As shown in Figure 6E, clear downregulation of canonical MZB1 protein level was also observed in four out of five CLL patients with SF3B1MUT, but not in SF3B1WT samples. The result for patient 8 could be explained by the low allele fraction for Y623C (10%), and this was associated with undetectable aberrant splicing for ZDHHC16 and no change in canonical MZB1 when compared with one of the SF3B1WT patients (Figure S6). ABCB7 is a mediator of iron accumulation and erythroid growth and has been reported to be downregulated specifically in an MDS subtype characterized by refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (Boultwood et al., 2008). Interestingly, SF3B1 mutations have been found at a frequency of 80%–90% in RARS, but not in other MDS subtypes (Papaemmanuil et al., 2011). In addition, a partial loss-of-function mutation in ABCB7 has been identified in X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia demonstrating an iron-overload phenotype in cells with defective ABCB7 (Allikmets et al., 1999). We identified that ABCB7 is aberrantly spliced in SF3B1 mutant cells (Figure 6F) and demonstrated that the aberrant transcript is subject to NMD, causing downregulation of the canonical transcript and protein (Figures 6A and 6D). Therefore, aberrant splicing and subsequent NMD of ABCB7 likely explains the association between ABCB7 downregulation observed in RARS and the presence of SF3B1 mutants. Taken together, these data suggest that SF3B1MUT might contribute to the phenotypes observed in diseases by inducing the generation of NMD-sensitive transcripts through aberrant splicing and to a subsequent reduction in the levels of the corresponding proteins.  44% of All Aberrantly Spliced Genes Are Putative Targets of NMD(A) Frequency of ...

See also Figure S6. Figure options Discussion In the current study, we describe the mechanism by which SF3B1 hotspot mutations induce aberrant splicing and the fate of resulting NMD-sensitive aberrant mRNAs in several cancer types. These mutations are associated with the expression of hundreds of aberrantly spliced junctions, mostly by utilizing a cryptic AG. While some aberrant junctions are common across different cancer types, others are tumor specific, which in some cases is a consequence of tissue-specific gene expression; however, additional factors likely contribute to these differences. Interestingly, aberrant splicing was observed only in patients carrying hotspot mutations located in the C-terminal HEAT domains, but not in samples from “non-hotspot” patients, as they clustered with the SF3B1WT patients in aberrant junction usage comparisons. The majority of these non-hotspot mutations are located away from the HEAT repeat domains, which suggests that they may have different effects on cancer cells or simply are passenger mutations, and are not the focus of the present study. We calculated an electrostatic potential map based on a homology model of SF3B1WT with importin-β and observed that all hotspot mutations are co-localized in a limited, positively charged region even though they are distributed across five different HEAT domains (Figure 7A). Furthermore, while there are various amino acid substitutions at the hotspots that result in change of size and/or polarity of side chains, our data suggest the functional consequences on splicing for these changes are similar. We show that hotspot SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ splicing in junctions associated with specific sequence features: an enrichment of As followed by a short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG located −15 to −24 nt from the canonical 3′ ss.

The position of the hotspot mutations located in the five HEAT repeat domains (highlighted in yellow) is represented in the inset. (B and C) Schematic representation of splicing in SF3B1WT (B) and SF3B1MUT (C) cells and molecular consequences of transcripts is also shown. Figure options Based on computational analysis, it was recently suggested that SF3B1 mutations cause a change in the size of the sterically protected region downstream of the BP without any altered BP recognition allowing the utilization of the cryptic AG (DeBoever et al., 2015). It was also suggested that SF3B1 mutations could alter interactions with U2AF2, affecting the ability to recognize the canonical 3′ ss and leading to cryptic 3′ ss selection. In contrast, we provide experimental evidence that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is insufficient for the recruitment of the U2AF complex and that the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss, and thereby interaction with U2AF2 is required to observe aberrant splicing as well. In addition, we have demonstrated that the SF3B1MUT U2 complex utilizes a BP that is different from the one used by the wild-type U2 complex (proposed model, Figures 7B and 7C). Based on these data and the restricted localization of the hotspot mutations, we hypothesize that SF3B1MUT interacts differently with the pre-mRNA or splicing factors that are important for the recognition of AG during the second step of splicing. The close proximity of the two mapped BPs for ZDHHC16 (−30A for SF3B1WT and −34A for SF3B1MUT) reported here (Figure 4E) and the published data on the crosslinking of SF3B1 to bases flanking the BPS (Gozani et al., 1998) would suggest a competition between the SF3B1WT- and SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 snRNP complexes to select the canonical or cryptic AG for splicing, respectively. The mechanism by which SF3B1MUT favors selection of a different BP can only be speculated at this point. Based on our data and a previous study investigating spliceostatin A’s mechanism of action (Corrionero et al., 2011), there are at least two hypotheses: the selection of the new BP is guided by SF3B1MUT through enhanced direct interactions with specific nucleotides flanking the new BPS compensating for reduced base pairing with U2 snRNA or by the base pairing of U2 snRNA with the new/suboptimal BPS compensating for impaired interactions of SF3B1MUT across the canonical BPS.  Although SF3B1MUT does not seem to affect the pre-assembly of U2 snRNP (preliminary data not shown), it is possible that the interactions with splicing factors involved in selection of an alternative AG in the second step of splicing are impaired. Previously, it has been reported that the second step splicing factor, Slu7, is required for correct 3′ ss selection (Chua and Reed, 1999a ;  Chua and Reed, 1999b). Similar to U2AF1, Slu7 harbors a Zn knuckle domain, and it is conceivable that it directly interacts with AG during the second step of splicing. As observed in the case of SF3B1MUT, depletion of Slu7 results in selection of a cryptic AG closer to the BPS. This suggests that SF3B1 hotspot mutations may impair the recruitment of Slu7 to the catalytic core. Additionally, it has been reported that splicing factor SPF45 (hSPF45 is RBM17) is involved in recognition and activation of an alternative AG upstream of the canonical 3′ ss. It has been suggested that SPF45 directly or indirectly binds to the upstream alternative AG with the help of SF3B1 and promotes its utilization during the second catalytic step (Corsini et al., 2007 ;  Lallena et al., 2002). Interestingly, as observed in the present study for SF3B1MUT, SPF45 also depends on the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss to splice at the alternative AG. Since SF3B1MUT binds at a different BPS, it can be speculated that the recruited SPF45 can access the cryptic AG which is otherwise prevented due to the steric hindrance by SF3B1WT. Taken together, the SF3B1 hotspot mutations could be facilitating SPF45 activity and/or abrogating Slu7 activity for selection of the aberrant AG, thereby providing an unanticipated mechanism for regulation of splice site utilization.  Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is a known cellular mechanism that adds complexity and flexibility in gene expression to induce stage-specific patterns not only by inducing expression of a particular isoform but also by engaging NMD to downregulate gene expression (Ge and Porse, 2014 ;  Kalyna et al., 2012). Here, we predicted that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced transcripts in SF3B1MUT cells are NMD sensitive, and we have demonstrated that the associated canonical isoforms are downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels. The downregulation of a large number of genes induced by this “spliceosome sickness” could be the cause of impaired cell functions that contribute to cancer phenotypes and potentially create dependency on essential genes or pathways for survival. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency is a proposed mechanism for disease pathogenesis in MDS, where chromosome 5q is deleted and decreased expression of genes located on the remaining chromosome is observed (e.g., RPS14 and CSKN1A1; Ebert et al., 2008 ;  Schneider et al., 2014). It is plausible that SF3B1 mutations contribute to MDS in a similar fashion by downregulating expression of certain genes resulting in a non-classical path to haploinsufficiency. In addition to the downregulation of canonical proteins, it is also possible that NMD-insensitive aberrant transcripts are translated into aberrant proteins that have altered function. Proteomic analysis of isogenic SF3B1MUT cells did not reveal the presence of aberrant proteins (data not shown), but this may be due to limitations of assay sensitivity, and additional targeted SILAC or deep RNA sequencing of active ribosome fractions may have the required sensitivity to detect such proteins. Recently, several groups reported the molecular consequences and phenotypic effects of other spliceosome mutations, such as U2AF1 and the exonic splicing enhancer binding serine/arginine-rich protein SRSF2 ( Ilagan et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015 ;  Shirai et al., 2015). Though there are some overlaps in genes differentially spliced in tissues affected by each spliceosome mutation, we see only minimal overlaps in predicted NMD targets (Figure S7). However, mutations in all three splicing factors are observed in MDS and are mutually exclusive, suggesting that some of the downstream effects might be common. Thus, while not explored in this study, it is likely that SF3B1 mutations result in defects in hematopoiesis, as has been observed in animal models of SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations. Additional work is ongoing to define the downstream splicing abnormalities that drive the phenotypic effects of spliceosome mutations. Finally, it is also plausible that mutations in SF3B1 impact other proposed splicing regulators (e.g., chromatin, histone modifications), and these should be the subject of future study ( de Almeida et al., 2011; Kfir et al., 2015 ;  Khan et al., 2013).  In summary, computational and experimental approaches were used to demonstrate that SF3B1MUT utilizes a different BP to induce aberrant splicing across multiple cancer types. These insights describe a neomorphic activity for SF3B1 mutations that causes downregulation of canonical protein expression. Furthermore, these studies provide a foundation for the potential discovery of targeted approaches for the treatment of patients carrying SF3B1 hotspot mutations.  Uveal melanoma, the most common eye malignancy causes severe visual morbidity and is fatal in about 50% of patients. Primary uveal melanoma can be cured by surgery or radiotherapy, but the metastatic disease is treatment refractory. To understand comprehensively uveal melanoma genetics, we performed SNP arrays and whole genome sequencing on 12 primary uveal melanomas. We observed only ~2000 predicted somatic single nucleotide variants per tumor and low levels of aneuploidy. We did not observe an ultraviolet radiation DNA-damage signature, but identified SF3B1 mutations in three samples and a further 15 mutations in an extension cohort of 105 samples. SF3B1 mutations were associated with good prognosis and were rarely coincident with BAP1 mutations. SF3B1 encodes a component of the spliceosome and RNA sequencing revealed that SF3B1 mutations were associated with differential alternative splicing of protein coding genes including ABCC5 and UQCC, and of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) CRNDE.  Keywords: uveal melanoma, whole genome sequencing, GNAQ/GNA11, SF3B1 Go to: Introduction Uveal melanoma arises in the iris, cilliary body and choroid. Light skin complexion, fair hair, blue eyes and the presence of cutaneous nevi are risk factors in uveal melanoma (1), but the UVR-associated increase in cutaneous melanoma that occurred in countries such as Australia over the past 4 decades has not been accompanied by parallel increases in uveal melanoma (2–4). Thus the role of UVR in uveal melanoma etiology is unclear.  Class 1 uveal melanomas present a low risk of metastasis, whereas class 2 tumors are highly metastatic and are characterized by monosomy of chromosome 3 and gain of 8q. Mutually exclusive mutations in GNAQ or GNA11, the principal driver oncogenes in uveal melanoma, occur in ~85% of cases (5, 6), and inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor BAP1 occur in ~85% of metastatic tumors and are associated with disease dissemination (7). Recently, exome sequencing of uveal melanomas has identified recurrent mutations in EIF1AX and SF3B1 (8, 9), predominantly in low grade tumors. Somatic mutations in SF3B1, which encodes a component of the spliceosome, also occur in hematological, breast and pancreatic cancers (10–13). Mutant SF3B1 is associated with differential gene splicing in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (14), but aberrant splicing in SF3B1 mutant uveal melanoma has not been reported (9).  To gain insight into uveal melanoma genetics, we performed SNP array analysis, whole genome sequencing, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 12 frozen primary uveal melanoma samples. Despite its dismal prognosis, we find that uveal melanoma has a remarkably low mutation burden, and we did not observe a UVR DNA-damage signature. However, we found recurrent mutations in SF3B1 that were associated with differential alternative splicing of both coding and non-coding genes that may play a role in the etiology of this disease.  Go to: Results Our discovery cohort comprised 12 primary uveal melanoma T3-T4 tumors that represented different histological types (1 epithelioid cell, 3 spindle cell and 8 mixed cases) and were treated by primary enucleation (Supplementary Table 1). One case was metastatic at diagnosis and 6 patients subsequently developed metastases. SNP array analysis was performed using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 SNP arrays and whole genome sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The whole genome sequence coverage was >30× (Supplementary Table 2) and the data were aligned to the reference genome and duplicate reads excluded. The whole genomes were compared to their matched normal DNA to identify chromosomal translocations, short insertions/deletions (indels) and somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs).  The SNP arrays revealed low levels of aneuploidy in 11 of the tumors and tetraploidy in tumor #7 (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Table 3). The diploid tumors presented recurrent chromosome 3 monosomy (9 tumors), losses of 1p (5 tumors), 6q (3 tumors) and 8p (5 tumors), and gains in 6p (4 tumors) and 8q (7 tumors; Supplementary Figs. S1, S2). These aberrations are characteristic of uveal melanoma, but we also observed loss of 16q in three tumors and gain of chromosome 11 in two (Supplementary Figs. S1, S2). The presence of two identical copies of chromosome 3 in tumor #7 suggested that chromosome 3 monosomy preceded acquisition of the tetraploid state. Tumor #7 also displayed trisomy for 1q and monosomy for 8p. Commensurate with the SNP array data, whole genome sequencing also revealed a low level of chromosomal aberrations. We predicted 2-59 inter-chromosomal translocations, 0-7 intra-chromosomal translocations, no inversions, 2-25 large deletions and 0-5 large insertions (Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Table 4). Thus, the frequency of structural variations in uveal melanoma is only ~40% of that reported in cutaneous melanoma and only ~20% of that reported in acral melanoma (Fig 1A)(15, 16). It is also only ~10% of that we recently found in mucosal melanoma (Fig. 1A) (17).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Somatic mutations in uveal melanoma. The whole genome sequencing also revealed a very low number of SNVs. We predicted only 1629-2604 (median 2112) somatic SNVs and 47-178 (median 67) somatic short indels (Table 1). The SNV mutation rate of <1 per Mb (Table 1) is markedly lower than is seen in most other types of cancer (Fig. 1B) and significantly lower than is seen in cutaneous (~30,000 mutations/genome), mucosal (~8000 mutations/genome), or acral (~5,000 mutations/genome) melanoma (15–17).  Table 1 Table 1 Summary of whole genome sequencing mutations for uveal melanoma. UVR-induced DNA damage is characterized by C>T transitions at the 3’ end of pyrimidine dinucleotides (18), a “signature” that accounts for 80-90% of mutations in cutaneous melanoma, and up to 60% of the mutations in acral melanoma (15, 16). Although C to T (G to A) transitions were the commonest mutation in uveal melanoma, they accounted for only ~35% of the lesions (Fig. 1C) and were not enriched at the 3’ position of pyrimidine dimers (Fig. 1D). Thus, UVR induced DNA damage does not appear to play a role in uveal melanomagenesis.  In line with the generally low level of mutations, we observed very few coding region mutations, predicting only 4-19 non-synonymous SNVs per tumor; of which 92% of those tested were validated by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Table 5). We also predicted only 0-2 coding region indels per tumor (Table 1). The only recurrent mutations were A>T, p.209L mutations in GNA11 (7 tumors) and T>A/T>G, p.209L mutations in GNAQ (3 tumors; Supplementary Table 6). We did, however, observe a small number of non-recurrent mutations in individual genes with possible functional significance, including C>T p.P107L in GNA15 that was coincident with A>T, p.209L GNA11 in tumor #10, C>T p.G8R in EIF1AX in tumor #8, and BAP1 mutations in 7 tumors (Supplementary Table 6).  Critically, we also observed non-recurrent mutations in SF3B1 in three tumors (T>G, p.K666T: tumor #6; T>C, p.K700E: tumor #11; C>T, p.R625H: tumor #12) and although there were no chromosome losses or gains in the region encoding SF3B1 (2q33.1) these data suggested a role for SF3B1 in uveal melanoma. We screened SF3B1 in 105 additional consecutive archival primary uveal melanomas and detected 15 additional mutations (8 p.R625H, 4 p.R625C, 1 p.R625P, 1 p.R625L, 1 p.K666T; Supplementary Table 7). Our overall mutation rate of 15% (18/119) is similar to the rate (18.6%) recently reported for SF3B1 mutations in uveal melanoma by whole exome sequencing (9), but note that in addition to the R625 codon mutations reported therein, we also observed K666 and K700 codon mutations (Supplementary Fig. S3). The SF3B1 mutations are inversely associated with chromosome 3 monosomy and notably, they are associated with improved progression-free and cancer survival (Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Fig. S4).  SF3B1 encodes subunit 1 of splicing factor 3b, a component of the spliceosome, so to evaluate the effects of SF3B1 mutations on uveal melanoma transcripts, we hybridized three SF3B1 mutated tumors and three SF3B1 wild-type tumors to Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Arrays (HTA2), which contain both exon and exon-exon junction probes. 325 genes were predicted to be differentially expressed, with 46 genes up-regulated and 279 genes down-regulated in the SF3B1 mutant compared to the SF3B1 wild-type tumors (Supplementary Table 8). Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes did not predict any significant GO term(s), and did not predict KEGG or REACTOME pathway enrichment. However, splicing level analysis predicted 130 genes that contained at least one differentially regulated exon and/or splicing pattern (Supplementary Table 9). Manual inspection of the predicted events by the GenoSplice EASANA® visualization interface revealed eight high-confidence or very high-confidence events, including alternative terminal exons (four events), alternative 3’ acceptor splice sites (two events), alternative cassette exons (one event), and intron retention (one event; Table 2). Critically, six of these events (GUSBP11, UQCC, ANKHD1, ADAM12, CRNDE and ABCC5) were also identified when we analyzed the RNA-seq data from Harbour et al. (Table 2).  Table 2 Table 2 Alternative gene splicing associated with SF3B1 mutations in uveal melanoma. Next, we compared the RNA-seq data from our three SF3B1 mutant to our nine SF3B1 wildtype tumors. For this we used DEXSeq, a Bioconductor package that uses generalized linear models to detect differential exon usage (19), and also MATS, which uses a Bayesian statistical framework to identify alternative splicing (20). 47 genes were predicted to be differentially spliced in these two populations by at least one algorithm (Supplementary Tables 10 & 11). Strikingly, when we compared our analysis of our HTA2 and the Harbour et al. data with our RNA-seq analyses, three alternative splicing events, CRNDE, ABCC5 and UQCC, were identified by all three analyses (Table 2). These data suggest that CRNDE, ABCC5 and UQCC are strong candidates for alternative splicing in SF3B1 mutant tumors, hence we examined the sequencing profiles for three genes in our RNA-seq data. We normalized the number of mapped bases for these genes and compared nucleotide coverage at each base in SF3B1 mutant and wild-type tumors (Fig. 2).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Alternative splicing in SF3B1 mutant uveal melanoma. The profiles for UQCC, revealed clear evidence of alternative terminal exon use in the SF3B1 wild-type and SF3B1 mutant tumors (Fig. 2A). For CRNDE we observed near uniform representation of all bases of exon 4 in the SF3B1 wild-type tumors, but an enrichment of the reads at the 3’ end of this exon in the SF3B1 mutant tumors (Fig. 2B). Finally, in ABCC5, we observed clear evidence of differential splicing of intron 8 (Fig. 2C). Critically, we detected all three of these splicing events when we analysed the RNA-seq data from Harbour et al (Supplementary Figure S5)(9) providing independent confirmation of these alternative splicing events.  Finally, to further validate our findings, we assessed alternative splicing of GUSBP11, UQCC, ANKHD1, GAS8, F8, ADAM12, CRNDE and ABCC5 – the eight genes that provided the strongest evidence of splicing – by qRT-PCR in 74 independent uveal melanomas comprising 58 SF3B1 wild-type and 16 SF3B1 mutant tumors. This analysis confirmed that all eight genes were alternatively spliced in SF3B1 mutant compared to SF3B1 wild-type tumors (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. S6).  Go to: Discussion We describe here the first whole genome sequencing of uveal melanoma, and our data reveal that this is a comparatively simple genetic disease characterized by recurrent chromosomal gains and losses and a relatively low number of SNVs and structural variants. The tumor genomes display a homogenous SNV burden, both in terms of number (1629-2604) and mutation class, and notably, they do not display a canonical UVR-induced DNA damage signature at pyrimidine dinucleotides. The absence of this signature negates an obvious influence of UVR in the etiology of this disease.  We confirm that GNAQ and GNA11 are the most commonly mutated driver oncogenes and that BAP1 is the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor. In addition, we confirm SF3B1 as recurrently mutated in 15% of cases, with a mutation hotspot at codon R625. SF3B1 mutations have been reported in hematological, breast and pancreatic cancers (10–13). Intriguingly, in those cancers codon K700 mutations predominate whereas in uveal melanoma R625 codon mutations predominate. This suggests that either the gene mutations have distinct etiology, so different hotspots are targeted in each disease, or that the diverse biology of the diseases favors selection of discrete mutations. Notably, in common with previous studies (8, 9), we confirm that in uveal melanoma SF3B1 mutations are associated with better prognosis. Thus, in uveal melanoma and myelodysplastic syndrome SF3B1 mutations are associated with improved outcome, whereas in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), SF3B1 mutations are associated with poorer prognosis (21).  SF3B1 encodes subunit 1 of splicing factor 3b, a component of the spliceosome, a large intracellular machine that processes precursor mRNA into mature transcripts. Specifically, splicing factor 3b anchors precursor mRNA onto the splicosome to define the splicing site. Previous studies show that spliceosomal component mutations can alter splicing within a gene, can cause intron retention or can cause aberrant alternative splicing, affecting protein isoform balance and thereby cell proliferation and differentiation (22, 23). In CLL, SF3B1 mutations are associated with alternative splicing at the 3’ ends of genes to generate truncated variants of the vitamin C transporter SLC23A2, the T-cell regulator TC1RG1, and the forkhead transcription factor FOXP1. We show that in uveal melanoma SF3B1 mutations are also associated with alternative splicing (Fig. 2D). We show that in common with CLL, SF3B1 mutations in uveal melanoma are associated with alternative splicing of the 3’ end of transcripts, for example in UQCC, which encodes the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex chaperone, a protein implicated in bone development and stature. We also see differential splicing of ABCC5, a multidrug resistance-associated protein that is implicated in breast cancer metastasis (24) and colorectal cancer (25). Interestingly, in uveal melanoma, we observe evidence of intron retention in ABCC5 in the SF3B1 wild type samples compared to the mutant samples, suggesting that this gene is more efficiently spliced in the SF3B1 mutant than wild-type tumors.  More intriguing, we show that SF3B1 mutations are associated with cryptic alternative splicing of exon 4 of CRNDE. This long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) exists in several alternatively spliced forms and is upregulated in both solid tumors and leukemias (26, 27). CRNDE in general, and exon 4 in particular is alternatively spliced in colorectal cancer and the alternative forms are thought to regulate gene expression by regulating chromatin-modifying enzymes (27, 28). We show that in uveal melanoma, mutations in SF3B1 are associated with cryptic alternative splicing within exon 4 of CRNDE, and considering the comparatively simple genetics of uveal melanoma, it will be important to determine how alternative splicing of this non-coding gene affects cellular function.  In conclusion, we show that despite its appalling prognosis, uveal melanoma is a relatively simple genetic disease characterized by recurrent chromosomal losses and gains, and a low mutational burden. We confirm that GNAQ/GNA11 are the most commonly mutated oncogenes and BAP1 the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor. We identify SF3B1 mutations in ~15% of cases and show these are associated with better prognosis, which will guide clinical management of this disease. Intriguingly, we show that SF3B1 mutations are associated with diverse alternative splicing events, including alternative terminal exon usage, intron retention and cryptic splicing within exons of both protein coding and non-coding genes. Future studies will focus on how these events affect uveal melanoma biology.  Go to: Methods Patient Cohorts  Discovery set Twelve patients with uveal melanoma were included in the WGS study (Supplementary table 1) from whom tumour and matched blood samples were obtained. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Institut Curie and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.  Validation set Consecutive patients diagnosed at the Institut Curie between January 2006 and December 2008 who underwent primary enucleation and with sufficient material at the Biobank were included in the validation series with exclusion of patients with metastasis at diagnosis. Patient characteristics are reported in Supplementary table 6. The follow-up for this analysis ended on December 2012, with a median time of 38 months. During this period, 57 patients (53%) developed metastatic disease and 50 patients (47%) died. Metastatic melanoma was the cause of the death in 43 patients (40%). DNA was extracted from frozen materials or FFPE sections. SF3B1, GNAQ, GNA11 and BAP1 were sequenced by Sanger methods. Oligonucleotide primer sequences are available upon request.  DNA and RNA extraction and sequence analysis  Tumor DNA and RNA were provided by the Biological Resource Center of the Institut Curie. The DNA was extracted from frozen tumor or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples using a standard phenol/chloroform procedure. The total RNA was isolated from frozen tumor samples using TRIzol reagent and cDNA synthesis was performed with MuLV Reverse Transcriptase in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France), with quality assessments performed on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. For Sanger sequencing, gDNA was amplified by PCR and the products were sequenced using dye-terminator chemistry as previously described (16). Primer sequences are available upon request. Sequences were visualized using Sequencher software.  Whole genome sequencing and analysis  Extracted DNA samples were sequenced on three lanes of Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencers to produce paired-end reads of 100bp. FASTQ files from each lane were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh37). Data for each sample were merged and duplicate reads were marked using Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net/). Somatic variants were identified by comparing matched tumor and normal genomes (Supplementary Methods).  SNP array analysis  Genome-wide genotyping for tumor and blood DNA samples was conducted on Illumina HumanOmni2.5 SNP arrays. Raw data files were processed using GenomeStudio and somatic alterations were identified (Supplementary Methods).  RNA extraction and Array hybridization  Total RNA was isolated from frozen biopsy using a miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and quality assessment was conducted using RNA 6000 Nano labchip (Bioanalyzer, Agilent) and by a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo). Total RNA RIN values were between 7.7 and 9 (average: 8.65). Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 ST arrays were hybridized according to Affymetrix recommendations using the Ambion WT protocol (Life technologies, France) and Affymetrix labeling and hybridization kits. 100ng of total RNA were processed in parallel with an external MAQC A RNA to control robustness of data. Labeled DNA mean yield was 7.19 µg (min: 6.27µg; max: 7.57µg). Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Transcriptome 2.0 ST microarrays (HTA2) were hybridized with 4.7 µg of labeled DNA. Raw data, transcript data and exon data were controlled with Expression console (Affymetrix) at the Institut Curie microarray core facility. The benefit of this array is to highlight spliced RNA isoforms using both exon and exon-exon junction probes that can measure excluded or included exons/regions.  Microarray data analysis  Affymetrix HTA2 dataset analysis was performed by GenoSplice technology (www.genosplice.com and Supplementary Methods). We performed an unpaired Student’s t-test to compare gene intensities between SF3B1 wild-type and SF3B1 mutated tumors. Genes were considered significantly differentially expressed when fold-change was ≥1.5 and P-value ≤0.05 (unadjusted P-value). Analysis at the splicing level was first performed taking into account only exon probes (‘EXON analysis’; see Supplementary Methods). Results were considered statistically significant for unadjusted P-values ≤ 0.05 and fold-changes ≥ 1.5 for SPLICING PATTERN analysis and unadjusted P-values ≤ 0.05 and fold-changes ≥ 2.0 for EXON analysis. After bioinformatics analysis of microarray data, a manual inspection using the GenoSplice EASANA® interface was conducted to select high-confident events.  RNA-seq analysis  RNA from the 12 tumor samples was sequenced (Supplementary Methods). Reads were aligned using Tophat (29). Differential splicing analysis between the mutant (n=3) and wild-type SF3B1 (n=9) samples was conducted using DEXseq (19) and events with an FDR <0.1 were regarded as significant. Differential splicing analysis was also conducted by MATS (20), using the mapped read bamfiles as input and events with an FDR <0.1 were regarded as significant. The RNA-seq data from the Habour et al. study (9) were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRA062359) and analysed using the same methodology with the exception that read lengths were trimmed to 99bp. One of the samples described as wild-type SF3B1 was predicted to have an SF3B1 R625C mutation (Supplementary Figure S7) and was designated SF3B1 mutant for the differential splicing analysis.  Splice variant analysis in the validation series  The validation set was used to measure the predicted splice variant of 8 genes using specific probes (Supplementary Table 12). 1.3ng of cDNA were analyzed in duplicate to quantify spliced and unspliced forms by real time PCR. 45 cycles of QPCR were conducted on 384 well plates using QuantiTect SYBR Green reagents (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) onto the ABI 9700HT device. To perform the splice variant analysis, 3 steps were achieved per gene of interest. First, CT values were averaged per sample, then a ratio of spliced form was calculated per sample using the formula: 2-(CT form1 mRNA - CT form2 mRNA). Finally, for each splicing event, a Mann-Whitney U test was applied between SF3B1 mutated and wildtype cases.  Statistical methods  Cancer-specific survival (CSS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to death from uveal melanoma or last follow-up. Event-free survival (EFS) was calculated from the surgical resection to development of metastasis or last follow-up. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method and the difference between groups was compared with the log-rank test. χ2 and Fisher's exact tests were used to determine association between variables. P-values less than 0.05 (two-sided) were considered statistically significant.  Data access  Whole genome, RNA-seq and SNP array data have been submitted to the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under study accession number EGAS00001000472. 
129||The RNA maturation is an important and complex biological process. It requires several small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that comprise the two forms of spliceosomes. The major form of spliceosome (U2-type) is composed of U1, U2, U4/6 and U5 snRNPs, and catalyzes most splicing events in metazoans.1  Mutations of genes, such as SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent SF1, SF3A1, U2AF2 or PRPF40B, encoding spliceosome compounds have been found to occur at high frequencies in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).2, 3, 4 Subsequently, SF3B1 mutations were also found in solid tumors such as endometrial, lung, bladder, pancreatic and breast carcinomas and cutaneous melanomas.5 We and others also reported that 15–20% of uveal melanoma (UM) carry SF3B1 mutations.6, 7, 8 SF3B1 (splicing factor 3 B subunit 1, also named SF3B155) is a central compound the U2 snRNP complex in direct contact with the branch site of the pre-mRNA. SF3B1 contains 22 HEAT repeats (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, Targets of rapamycin 1). Major hotspots of missense mutations of SF3B1 target one of the HEAT repeats at positions R625, K666 and K700, with variability according to diseases, R625 and K700 mutations being the most prevalent in UM and hematologic disorders, respectively. Prognosis value of these mutations vary according to diseases, SF3B1 mutations are associated with poor outcomes in CLL and favorable outcomes in UM.9 SF3B1 mutations are especially associated with the refractory anemia with excess of ring sideroblasts (RARS), a mild form of MDS with little impact on patient’s survival. Consequences of these mutations on splicing are less clear. Aberrant splicing associated with SF3B1 was reported by two landmark publications.2, 3 However, little overlap was found between MDS and CLL. Furthermore, Harbour et al.6 found no splicing effect of SF3B1 mutations in a series of UM patients analyzed by RNA-seq. By combining exon array and RNA-seq analyzes, we recently reported alternative transcripts of eight genes statistically associated with SF3B1 R625 mutations and linked to various RNA processing mechanisms: alternative terminal exons (UQCC, ADAM12, GAS8), alternative 3′ acceptor splice sites (CRNDE, ANKHD1), alternative cassette exons (GUSBP1), alternative first exon (F8) and intron retention (ABCC5).7  Five of these differential splicing events (CRNDE, GUSBP11, UQCC, ABCC5 and ANKHD1) were most consistently associated with the SF3B1-mutated status. Here we explored whether this splicing signature was also associated with SF3B1 mutations in malignancies other than UM, namely in MDS and CLL.  Series of CLL (26 cases), MDS of various subtypes (48 cases) and UM (87 cases) were assembled. These samples were genotyped for the recurrent mutated genes of the spliceosome, and biological and clinical data were obtained (see Supplementary Table for sample characteristics). After RNA extraction and reverse transcription, samples were analyzed for the two splice forms of UQCC, CRNDE, ANKHD1, GUSBP1 and ABCC5 by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) as described previously.7 CRNDE was poorly expressed in CLL, below the detection sensitivity of the RT-QPCR in most cases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied on the splicing ratio of the five expressed genes obtained for the series of MDS and CLL data, as well as with that of the series of UM previously reported.7 Whereas no disease aggregation was observed in the clustering, all SF3B1-mutated samples clustered in a single branch (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table for complete sample status). More specifically, this group of samples included 8 CLL SF3B1-mutated samples (K700E (6), K666T (1) and G742D (1)), 24 MDS SF3B1-mutated sample cases (K700E (14), H622Q (4), D781G (2), R625L/H/D/C (4)) and 19 SF3B1-mutated UM samples (R625H/C/L/P (16), K666M/T (2), K700E (1)). As expected, most SF3B1-mutated MDS were classified as RARS or refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (16 and 4, respectively out of 23 cases). No SF3B1-mutated samples were misclassified, except one MDS sample, MDS44 and one UM case, UM48, with low but detectable frequencies of mutated SF3B1 allele, which segregated with wild-type cases. Five cases without detected splicesome mutations (one MDS, two UM and two CLL) clustered in this branch corresponding to the mutated samples. The three SRSF2-mutated MDS cases, bearing the P95H hotspot mutation, segregated in the second branch with the wild-type samples, suggesting that this mutant-splicing factor differently affects the splicing process than the SF3B1 mutants. Two MDS samples bearing ZRSR2 missense mutations of unknown functional consequences (K413E and V304M) segregated each in a different branch.  Figure 1.

An unsupervised hierarchical clustering and a heatmap are performed using the difference in Ct (threshold cycle) between the two splicing forms expression for the five genes, measured by RT-QPCR for a series of 161 tumor samples representing 3 pathologies: uveal melanoma (UM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Data were normalized on mean and standard deviation within each pathology and research center. Clustering was performed based on Euclidian distance by Ward’s method. Splicing status is indicated by color code, representing: WT, wild-type status of the tested spliceosome compounds; SF3B1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2, mutated status of these genes, respectively. NA, not available.  Full figure and legend (124K)  Several conclusions could be drawn from these results. First, it is the first time that consistent splicing abnormalities are associated with SF3B1 mutations. The fact that the same splicing pattern is observed in tumor cells from different lineages and embryonic origins, strongly argues for a direct consequence of SF3B1 mutation. Second, the same pattern is observed irrespective of the mutated HEAT repeats of SF3B1. The reason for different hotspot mutations in different malignancies is largely unexplained but no different consequence was detected in the limited splicing events explored here. Third, the other mutated spliceosome compounds present in our series, including SRSF2 and ZRSR2, did not share the splicing abnormalities of the SF3B1 mutants. Finally, while no false negative was present in the clustering, the splicing pattern of 5 out of 161 samples from the three series was undistinguishable from that of SF3B1 samples, suggesting either experimental limitation of our splicing analysis or undetected abnormalities of the splicing machinery.  Our data clearly associate specific splicing abnormalities to SF3B1 mutations but these abnormalities are most probably not limited to those analyzed here. To statistically demonstrate splicing variants among more than 200 000 different splicing events remains challenging. It requires reliable molecular tools such as the latest generation of exon array or RNA-seq, efficient bioinformatics and large series of cases. It is thus likely that only the most consistent events were picked by the analysis of a limited number of mutated cases. Splicing forms yet to be discovered may better explain the oncogenic pathways activated by mutant SF3B1. Finally, our results do not rule out functions of SF3B1 besides splicing, which deregulations could intervene in oncogenesis.  Discovery of recurrent missense mutations in splicing factors in cancers revealed the importance of the spliceosome pathway as a direct actor in carcinogenesis and questioned functional roles and molecular mechanisms of these mutations. SF3B1 (Splicing Factor 3B Subunit 1A) encodes for a core component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex of the spliceosome and is involved in early stages of splicing. Alterations in SF3B1 were initially discovered in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), together with other mutations of splicing factors, such as U2AF1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2 (refs 1, 2, 3). Importantly, these genes encode proteins that are all involved in 3′-splice site recognition during RNA splicing4. It has been shown that SF3B1 is mutated in a significant proportion (∼20%) of uveal melanoma (UM), a rare malignant entity deriving from melanocytes from the uveal tract5,6,7, and in other solid tumours at lesser frequencies8,9.  RNA splicing is a fundamental process in eukaryotes, which is carried out by the splicing machinery (spliceosome) composed of five snRNPs and additional proteins10. Introns contain consensus sequences that define the 5′ donor splice site (5′ss), branchpoint (BP) and 3′ acceptor splice site (3′ss), which are initially recognized by the U1 snRNP, SF1 protein and U2AF, respectively. U2AF is a heterodimer composed of U2AF2 (also known as U2AF65) and U2AF1 (also known as U2AF35), which recognize the poly-pyrimidine tract and the well-conserved AG dinucleotide sequence of 3′ss, respectively. After binding to the 3′ss, U2AF facilitates replacement of SF1 by U2 snRNP at the BP. Interaction between U1 and U2 snRNPs then triggers transesterification joining the 5′-end of the intron to the BP, most generally an adenosine located in a loosely defined consensus ∼25 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ss. The 5′ss and 3′ss are then ligated together and the branched intron is discarded10.  SF3B1 mediates U2 snRNP recruitment to the BP by interacting with the intronic RNA on both sides of the BP and with U2AF11. Structurally, the SF3B1 protein has an N-terminal hydrophilic region containing U2AF-binding motif and a C-terminal region, which consists of 22 non-identical HEAT (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, Targets of rapamycin 1) repeats. Cancer-associated mutations in SF3B1 are missense mutations with three major hotspots targeting the fifth, sixth and seventh HEAT repeats at codon positions R625, K666 and K700, respectively. Interestingly, K700 mutations are by far the most frequent in haematopoietic malignancies, whereas R625 mutations are prevailing in UM. These alterations affect residues that are predicted to be spatially close to one another and therefore might have a similar functional impact1.  Recently, RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of CLL, breast cancer and UM showed that a global splicing defect in SF3B1-mutated tumours consists in usage of cryptic 3′ss (hereafter called AG′) located 10 to 30 bases upstream of normal 3′ss, yet the underlying mechanism has remained poorly understood. It has been proposed that AG′ is located at the end of a sterically protected region in a specific region downstream the BP. Yet, not every potentially located AG′ was used in an SF3B1MUT context12.  In the present study, RNA-Seq analysis of 74 primary UMs, mutated or not for SF3B1, confirmed the SF3B1MUT-promoted pattern identified by DeBoever et al.12, demonstrating the robustness of the deregulated pattern. By constructing in cellulo models, we show that SF3B1MUT is the direct cause of the deregulated splice pattern and could be qualified neither as gain-of-function (that is, hyperactivity) nor loss-of-function, but rather as change-of-function mutants. Our experiments provided evidence that (i) mutant SF3B1 preferentially recognizes alternative BPs upstream of the canonical sites and (ii) the alternative 3′ss used in a SF3B1MUT context are less dependent on U2AF. We propose a model of the SF3B1MUT dysfunctions that sheds new light on the mechanism of splicing dysregulation in cancer. In addition, our data reveal a currently under-appreciated role for recently described alternative branch points13 in alternative splicing and disease.  Results SF3B1 mutations promote upstream alternative acceptors Following initial finding of recurrent mutations of SF3B1 gene in UM5, we set up an independent consecutive series of UM to analyse the effect of SF3B1 hotspot mutations. This series included 74 T2–T4 tumours of different histologic types (21 epithelioid cell, 18 spindle cell and 35 mixed cases) treated by primary enucleation. Thirty-eight cases (51%) subsequently developed metastases and 40 patients (54%) died. SF3B1 mutations were found in 16 tumours affecting two hotspots p.R625 and p.K666 (Supplementary Table 1). No mutation of other genes coding for splicing factors was observed. SNP array analysis did not reveal any chromosome loss or gain in the region containing SF3B1 (2q33.1). The overall mutation rate of 22% (16/74) is comparable to the rate (19%) recently reported for SF3B1 mutations in UM5,6,7.  To evaluate the effects of SF3B1 mutations on splicing, we performed transcriptome analysis of the UM cohort using RNA-Seq technique. Differential analysis of splice junctions between the SF3B1MUT (n=16) and SF3B1WT (n=56) tumours using DESeq2 (ref. 14) revealed an overall high level of differences. The top 1,469 differentially spliced junctions with P-values ≤10−5 (Benjamini-Hochberg) and absolute Log2(fold change)≥1 were selected for further analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). A hierarchical clustering of the 74 tumours using the 1,469 differential splicing junctions showed coherent changes in SF3B1MUT tumours (Fig. 1a). A single SF3B1WT tumour clustered together with SF3B1MUT cases. Manual reanalysis excluded any variant of its SF3B1-coding sequence or any over- or under-expression of the SF3B1 transcript and exome sequencing of this case failed to identify any mutation of the spliceosome genes as a potential genocopy.  Figure 1: Differential splice junctions in SF3B1MUT tumours. Figure 1 (a) Hierarchical clustering and heat-map analysis of differential splice junctions in tumour samples. The colours of squares below the tree denote the subtype of each sample. Below the array tree and the subtype identification row, the heat map of the 1,469 splice junctions is shown. The complete list of up- and downregulated splice junctions can be found in Supplementary Data 1. (b) Venn diagram of differential splice junctions in SF3B1MUT compared with SF3B1WT tumours. Numbers show the count of alterations within only 5′ss (186 events) or only 3′ss (1,124 events). The overlapping area represents junctions that are either ambiguously attributed to an alternative donor or acceptor site, or attributed to both alternative 3′ and 5′ splice sites (159 events). (c) Distances between the alternative and canonical SF3B1MUT-sensitive 3′ss. For alternative 3′ss within the 50 nts preceding the canonical 3′ss (765), the distance between the alternative (AG’) and corresponding canonical (AG) 3′ss was plotted as a histogram. Negative distances mean the alternative AG’ upstream of the canonical AG, whereas positive distances mean the AG’ downstream. The 0 point demarks the position of the canonical AG. Full size image Interestingly, 72% (1,060/1,469) of differential splice variants had no Ensembl Transcript identifiers (ENST) and these novel splice variants were found almost exclusively in SF3B1 mutants. To be noticed, only 9% (12,866/142,458) of non-differential splice variants had no ENST. The acceptor splice site (3′ss) was altered in 1,124 differential junctions (76.5%), whereas the altered donor splice site (5′ss) was observed in 186 differential junctions (12.7%; Fig. 1b). For 159 junctions (10.8%), the novel junction was either ambiguously attributed to the alternative 5′ or 3′ss, or attributed to both alternative 5′ss and 3′ss.  The analysis of distances between the alternative and canonical SF3B1MUT-sensitive 3’ss showed repetitive peaks of alternative 3’ss every three nucleotides (Fig. 1c). Such spacing of two nucleotides suggests that frameshift variants are targeted by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.  We observed that the majority (765 out of 1,124) of the SF3B1MUT-promoted alternative 3′ss—thereafter named AG′—were located within 50 nucleotides (nts) that precede the canonical 3′ss—thereafter named AG—with a clear clustering in the −12 to −24 nt region upstream of the canonical AG (Fig. 1c). No ENST Identifier exists for 675 out of these 765 AG′ alternative acceptor sites (88%).  These results are concordant with a recent study based on RNA-Seq data from CLL, breast cancer and UM samples12. DeBoever et al. showed that 619 cryptic 3′ss clustering 10–30 nucleotides upstream of canonical 3′ss were used in cancers with SF3B1 mutations. Interestingly, we found 327 out of these 619 cryptic 3′ss (53%) to be differentially expressed in our data set, demonstrating the robustness of this splicing pattern despite the differences in the series of analysed tumours and bioinformatics pipelines.  Sequence context determines acceptor sensitivity to SF3B1 MUT To validate the splice pattern detected in SF3B1MUT tumours and to determine if it is conferred by sequences in the region of the 3′ss, we performed minigene splicing assay. We selected seven 3′ss within the top differential splice junctions associated with SF3B1MUT tumours (named as sensitive 3′ss) and two 3′ss found unaltered in an SF3B1MUT context (named as insensitive 3′ss; Table 1). Regions containing the selected 3′ss were cloned into an ExonTrap vector and expressed into human cell lines with different SF3B1 status: 2 UM cell lines, MP41 (SF3B1WT) and Mel202 (SF3B1R625G; Supplementary Figs 2 and 3). In addition, to directly determine whether the splice pattern detected in SF3B1MUT tumours is dependent on SF3B1 status, we used two isogenic HEK293T cell lines, SF3B1WT and SF3B1K666T obtained by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. RNA-Seq data, as visualized by IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer), showed different mutation rates of 30% in Mel202 cells and 14% in SF3B1K666T HEK293T cells, because of multiple copies of the wild-type SF3B1 allele in these aneuploid cell lines. As expected, Mel202 (SF3B1MUT) clusters with the SF3B1MUT tumours and MP41 (SF3B1WT) clusters with SF3B1WT tumours. Probably due to its low level of SF3B1K666T expression, SF3B1K666T-HEK293T clusters together with HEK293T (WT) and SF3B1WT tumours (Supplementary Fig. 2).  Table 1: Sensitive and insensitive 3′ss selected for validation in cell lines. Full size table The splice forms corresponding to canonical AG usage were found expressed after transfection of the insensitive 3′ss constructs in all cell lines, regardless of their SF3B1 status (Fig. 2a). Likewise, for the seven sensitive 3′ss constructs, the splice forms corresponding to canonical AG usage were found expressed in the SF3B1WT cell lines MP41 and HEK293T. By contrast, the SF3B1MUT cell lines Mel202 and SF3B1K666T HEK293T expressed the alternative splice forms using the alternative AG′ in addition to the canonical AG (Fig. 2a). The correspondence between band sizes and splice usage was verified by Sanger sequencing. Interestingly, the ratio of the alternative AG′ versus canonical AG usage (AG′/AG) based on capillary electrophoresis profiles varied according to the SF3B1MUT/SF3B1WT rate in the cell lines (Fig. 2b,c). Of note, a faint but significant usage of alternative AG′ in SF3B1WT cell lines was detected on the capillary electrophoresis profiles for three sensitive 3′ss, ENOSF1, TMEM14C and ZNF76 (AG′/AG in SF3B1WT cell lines=0.2, 0.1 and 0.07, respectively), implying that the AG′ usage may be reinforced rather than induced de novo in an SF3B1MUT context (Fig. 2b).  Figure 2: In cellulo validation of differential splice junctions. Figure 2 (a) Minigene splice assay of two SF3B1MUT-insensitive 3′ss (WRAP73 and VPS45) and 6 SF3B1MUT-sensitive 3′ss (TMEM14C, ENOSF1, ZNF76, DPH5, DLST, ARMC9). Gel electrophoresis shows the different splicing processes for minigene ExonTrap constructions in SF3B1WT cell lines (MP41 and HEK293T) and SF3B1MUT cell lines (Mel202 and K666T-SF3B1 HEK293T). The lower band corresponds to the variant generated by the usage of the canonical 3′ss (AG). The intermediate band corresponds to a splice generated by the usage of the alternative 3′ss (AG’). The upper band is the heteroduplex formation from two bands (AG and AG’). (b) Analysis of alternative AG’ and canonical AG usage of the ExonTrap construct (ENOSF1) in cell lines by capillary electrophoresis of RT–PCR products. Representative GeneMarker electrophoregrams for fragment analysis of ENOSF1 minigene cDNA expression are shown. The x axis represents molecular size (in nucleotides (nts)) of PCR products, and the y axis indicates relative fluorescent units (RFUs). The peak of 203 nts refers to the internal splicing of the pET01 ExonTrap vector using its 3′ss and 5′ss. The peak of 303 nts corresponds to the usage of the canonical AG, whereas the peak of 319 nts corresponds to the usage of alternative AG’ WT. (c) Heat-map analysis using the AG’/AG ratio of the top differential splice junctions in cell lines as determined by capillary electrophoresis of RT–PCR products. Full size image In conclusion, we demonstrate that the aberrant splice pattern is strictly dependent on the SF3B1MUT status and on sequences in the close vicinity of the sensitive 3′ss.  SF3B1 hotspot mutations are change-of-function mutations The mode of action of SF3B1 mutant was then addressed by analysing endogenous DPH5 and ARMC9 transcripts. The different cell lines were transiently transfected with expression vectors for SF3B1WT and SF3B1K700E and examined 48 h later for the AG′/AG usage of endogenous 3′ss (Fig. 3a). We represent the shift from the canonical AG to the alternative AG′ by the AG′/AG index, which is the ratio of mRNA expression of AG′ form to AG form of a validated gene, DPH5 or ARMC9, determined by quantitative reverse transcription (RT)–PCR. The overexpression of SF3B1K700E significantly increased the AG′/AG index in SF3B1WT cell lines (10- and 32-fold increases for DPH5 in MP41 and HEK293T, respectively), whereas overexpression of SF3B1WT had no effect on the AG′/AG index. The overexpression of SF3B1K700E increased by only three-fold the AG′/AG index in SF3B1K666T HEK293T (transcript mutation rate=14%) and did not modify it in Mel202 cell line (transcript mutation rate=30%), which may indicate a saturating effect of SF3B1MUT. Similar results were obtained with the endogenous sensitive 3′ss of ARMC9. We conclude that SF3B1 mutation does not lead to a hyper-activity of the protein, as its phenotype is not reproduced by SF3B1 overexpression.  Figure 3: Overexpression and underexpression of wild-type SF3B1 do not reproduce the splice pattern of SF3B1 hotspot mutations. Figure 3 (a) Effect of overexpression of wild-type and mutated SF3B1 on the AG’/AG ratio of DPH5 and ARMC9 in SF3B1WT and SF3B1MUT cell lines. MP41, Mel202, HEK293T and SF3B1K666T-HEK293T cell lines were transiently transfected with expression vectors for SF3B1WT and SF3B1K700E. The protein overexpression was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Flag using β-actin as a loading control (upper panel). Ratios of expression levels of alternative AG’ and canonical AG forms (AG’/AG) of DPH5 and ARMC9 were determined by quantitative RT–PCR (lower panel). The results are average of three replicates and are represented as mean±s.d. Paired t-test was used to generate the P-values comparing each condition to the empty vector transfection: NS, non-significant; *P>0.05; ***P<0.001. (b) Effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of SF3B1 on the AG’/AG ratio in cell lines. HEK293T, MP41 and Mel202 cells were transiently transfected with non-target control siRNA or two different siSF3B1: ‘4’and ‘5’. Proteins and RNA were extracted at 48 h after transfection. siRNA-mediated knockdown was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-SF3B1, using anti-β-actin as a loading control. Numbers represent the protein band intensity normalized to β-actin and expressed as a percentage of control samples (upper panel). Ratios of expression levels of alternative AG’ form to the expression level of canonical AG form (AG’/AG) of DPH5 were determined by quantitative RT–PCR (lower panel). The results are average of three replicates and are represented as mean±s.d. Full size image To determine whether SF3B1 mutations are loss-of-function mutations, we then assessed the effect of SF3B1 short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown on alternative splicing in SF3B1WT HEK293T and MP41 and in SF3B1MUT Mel202. Non-target siRNA was used as a negative control and siRNA-mediated knockdown was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3b). As shown in Fig. 3b, SF3B1 siRNA-mediated knockdown did not have any significant effect on AG′/AG index despite up to 93% of SF3B1 protein level reduction. These findings demonstrate that the SF3B1MUT splice pattern is not mimicked by SF3B1 knockdown.  Altogether, our results provide the first evidence that SF3B1 mutants are neither gain- (hyperactive) nor loss-of-function mutants, and suggest change-of-function consequences.  SF3B1 MUT-promoted AG′ are weakly dependent on U2AF As sensitivity to SF3B1 mutants was conferred by sequences in the close vicinity of 3′ss (Fig. 2), we searched for a sequence pattern associated with sensitive 3′ss. We compared the sequences of alternative AG′, corresponding canonical AG, and insensitive 3′ss (Fig. 4a). Two obvious features were found associated with AG′ consensus sequence: the paucity of G nucleotide at +1 position, and the frequency of A nucleotides at −11 to −14. Only 20% of G was observed for the alternative AG′, compared with ∼50% of G for both canonical AG and insensitive 3′ss (Fig. 4b). The high proportion of AG-(C/T) in the alternative AG′ site (65% versus 23% in AG′ and AG, respectively) is best explained by the presence of the AG′ within the polypyrimidine tract of the corresponding canonical AG. AG-G is part of the recognition motif of U2AF1 (ref. 15). The low frequency of G nucleotide immediately following alternative AG′ sites suggests lesser dependence to U2AF1 compared with the canonical AG at the step of 3’ss recognition16,17,18. To test this hypothesis, MP41 and HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with siU2AF1 or siU2AF2. Efficient knockdown was confirmed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4c, both U2AF1 and U2AF2 knockdowns increased the AG′/AG index of DPH5 and ARMC9 in SF3B1WT cells, and had no significant effect in SF3B1R625/K666 cells (Fig. 4c). These findings suggest that AG′ is less dependent on U2AF than the competing canonical AG.  Figure 4: Characterization of alternative 3′ss (AG’) sequences. Figure 4 (a) Comparison of sequence logos of 3′ss sensitive to SF3B1 status with canonical (AG) and alternative (AG’) sequences and 3′ss insensitive to SF3B1 status. One-hundred-nucleotide-long sequences surrounding the 3′ss were used to generate sequence logos with WebLogo. The height of each letter indicates the preference strength for that nucleotide at each position. (b) The proportion of the nucleotides immediately following the alternative (AG’), the canonical (AG) and insensitive 3′ss. (c) Effect of U2AF35 and U2AF65 siRNA-mediated knockdown on the AG’/AG ratio in cell lines. MP41 and HEK293T (SF3B1WT) and Mel202 and SF3B1K666T-HEK293T (SF3B1MUT) cells were transiently transfected with non-target control siRNA, siU2AF35 or siU2AF65. Proteins and RNA were extracted at 48 h after transfection. siRNA-mediated knockdown was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-U2AF35 and anti-U2AF65, using anti-β-actin as a loading control. Numbers represent the protein band intensity normalized to β-actin and expressed as percentage of control samples (upper panel). Ratio of expression levels of alternative AG’ form to the expression level of canonical AG form (AG’/AG) of DPH5 and ARMC9 was determined by quantitative RT–PCR (lower panel). The results are average of three replicates and are represented as mean±s.d. (d) Effect of U2AF35 hotspot mutations on the AG’/AG ratio of DPH5 in MDS tumours. Ratio of expression levels of alternative AG’ form to the expression level of canonical AG form (AG′/AG) of DPH5 was determined by quantitative RT–PCR in two MDS samples, each harbouring one of the two U2AF35 hotspot mutations, S34F and Q157P and compared with mutated and wild-type SF3B1 uveal melanoma (UM) samples. Full size image One hypothesis to explain why U2AF knockdown partially mimicked the effect of SF3B1MUT was that the SF3B1–U2AF2 interaction11 might be decreased in the case of mutant SF3B1. However, U2AF2 and U2AF1 antibodies immunoprecipitated equally SF3B1WT and SF3B1K700M, implying no detectable alteration in the SF3B1MUT–U2AF interaction (Supplementary Fig. 4).  Considering that U2AF1 mutations are reported in ∼10% of patients with MDS and associated with partial functional impairment in regulated splicing2,19, we tested two MDS samples each harbouring one of the two U2AF1 hotspot mutations, S34F and Q157P. Neither of these MDS samples presented any increase of the AG′/AG index of DPH5, demonstrating that U2AF1 and SF3B1 hotspot mutations do not lead to the same aberrant splicing phenotype (Fig. 4d).  Overall, our results exclude a defective SF3B1MUT–U2AF interaction and show that U2AF1MUT and SF3B1MUT can induce different splicing patterns. Importantly, the rarity of G at the position +1 after AG′ as well as the increase of AG′/AG transcript ratio when U2AF is depleted suggest that SF3B1MUT-promoted 3′ss (AG′) is less dependent on U2AF as compared with downstream canonical 3′ss (AG).  Alternative BP usage in an SF3B1 MUT context The second feature characterizing the AG′ consensus sequence is the presence of frequent adenosines at a distance of 11–14 nts preceding the AG′, which could represent alternative BPs (Fig. 4a). Exploring this hypothesis, we investigated whether SF3B1MUT alters BP choice.  We used the online tools SVM (Support Vector Machine algorithm)-BPfinder and the Human Splicing Finder to predict the BP of the 744 sensitive 3′ss. The predicted BP clustered together at ∼22 nts upstream the insensitive 3′ss. However, the predicted BP for the alternative and canonical 3′ss showed a bi-modal distribution centred at 5 and 15 nts upstream the AG′, and at 20 and 35 nts upstream AG (Fig. 5a). Using the experimentally determined BP data set recently reported by Mercer et al.13, we found 286 out of the 744 sensitive 3’ss with a determined BP in an SF3B1WT context (Fig. 5a). Remarkably, we found that 37% (105/286) of the A of the BP coincided with the A of AG′. Most of the other BP were closely distributed upstream of AG′ at an average of 5 nts. This superimposition of BP and AG′ made unlikely the usage of the same BP for both the canonical AG and alternative AG′. We thus suspected the usage of alternative branchpoint (BP′), possibly corresponding to the second peak of predicted BP around 35 nts 5′ to the AG and ∼15 nts 5′ to the AG′ (Fig. 5a).  Figure 5: Identification of alternative branchpoint usage in an SF3B1MUT context. Figure 5 (a) Analysis of distances between the branchpoints and the associated alternative (AG’), canonical (AG) or insensitive 3′ss. Left panel: Zero represents the position of the AG’, AG or insensitive 3′ss.

Right panel: the extracted branchpoint sequence logos generated by WebLogo. **Significantly different in the three branchpoint patterns (χ2 test, P<0.01), ***Significantly different in the three branchpoint patterns (χ2 test, P<0.001). (b) Point mutations of branchpoints in TMEM14C and ENOSF1 ExonTrap constructs. All adenosines within a region of 30 nts preceding the canonical AG were mutated into guanines. Mutant constructs were expressed in MP41 (SF3B1WT) and Mel202 (SF3B1MUT) cells followed by RT–qPCR. The lower band corresponds to the variant generated by the usage of the canonical 3′ss (AG). The intermediate band corresponds to the variant generated by the usage of the alternative 3′ss (AG’). The upper band is the heteroduplex formation from two bands (AG and AG′). The numbers represent the ratio of AG’ usage as determined by capillary electrophoresis. (c) Base-pairing potential mutants of TMEM14C. Mutant constructs (sequences shown in Supplementary Fig. 5) were expressed in MP41 (SF3B1WT) and Mel202 (SF3B1MUT) cells followed by RT–qPCR. The lower band corresponds to the variant generated by the usage of the canonical 3′ss (AG). The upper band corresponds to the variant generated by the usage of the alternative 3′ss (AG’). A schematic presentation of the strength of the resulting branchpoints as estimated by their SVM score is shown on the right panel. The ratio of AG’ usage as determined by capillary electrophoresis in MP41 and Mel202 cells is shown as a heat map. Full size image To explore such hypothesis, we mutated all adenosines within a region of 30 nts preceding the canonical AG in two sensitive sequences, TMEM14C and ENOSF1. These two minigenes were selected for their low frequency of adenosines upstream the 3′ss in order to limit the number of required site-directed mutations. We then expressed these variant acceptor sequences in MP41 (SF3B1WT) and Mel202 (SF3B1MUT) cells followed by RT–quantitative PCR and fragment analysis by capillary electrophoresis as described above (Fig. 5b).  The observed consequences of TMEM14C mutants were the following: (i) the -17A>G_-16A>G-double mutation completely abolished the usage of the alternative AG′ in both recipient cell lines; (ii) the -13A>G mutation had no consequence on 3′ss usage; (iii) the -6A>G mutation completely abolished the usage of the canonical AG; (iv) the -2A>G mutation completely abolished the usage of the alternative AG′ as it destroyed the AG′ site.  We interpret these data as indicating that the A at 30 nts upstream of AG is the BP′ for AG′, as its mutation allowed only the use of the canonical AG regardless of SF3B1 status. Alternatively, -6A>G mutation switched the usage of the AG to the usage of AG′, arguing that this site may serve as the BP for the canonical AG. Our data therefore support the existence of two branchpoints, BP and BP′, differentially used depending on the SF3B1 status.  Similar observations were obtained with the ENOSF1 construct confirming the existence of two different BPs. Specifically, we could determine the BP′ of AG′ at 29 nts preceding the AG (-29A>G). The -18A>G mutation disturbed the usage of both AG′ and AG, whereas the -17A>G mutation disturbed AG usage and inhibited the usage of AG′. In fact, the later mutation created another alternative acceptor site replacing the AG′ (AAG>AGG), and competing with the canonical AG. The potential BP was loosely defined for ENOSF1, because of the multiple adenosines in the vicinity of AG′ participating to the usage of the canonical AG. To be noticed, the -15A>G mutation of the nucleotide immediately following the AG′ strengthened the alternative site, presumably by reinforcing the binding of U2AF1 to the AG′-G site. Thus, the analyses of both the TMEM14C and ENOSF1 genes indicate that SF3B1MUT affects the 3′ss choice by promoting the use of alternative BPs.  SF3B1 plays a major role in U2 snRNP recruitment to the BP. To determine whether the potential of BP sequences to form base-pairing interaction with U2 snRNA (small nuclear RNAs) can modulate the sensitivity to SF3B1 mutations, BP and BP′ mutants of TMEM14C were generated (Supplementary Fig. 5). The strength of the resulting BPs was estimated by their SVM score20 (Fig. 5c). The TMEM14Cmut1 allows a perfect base-pairing of BP with U2 snRNA21; TMEM14Cmut2 contains a suboptimal BP; TMEM14Cmut3 contains a defective alternative BP′; TMEM14Cmut2+3 includes both TMEM14Cmut2 and TMEM14Cmut3 mutated regions and TMEM14Cswap contains swapped endogenous BP and BP′ sequences.  The consequences of these mutants were then assessed by the AG′/AG index (RT–PCR). Enhancing the base-pairing of the BP region (TMEM14Cmut1), disrupting BP′ (TMEM14Cmut3) or combining a disrupted BP′ with a suboptimal BP (TMEM14Cmut2+3) led to a total inhibition of AG′ usage, regardless of the SF3B1 status. Decreasing the strength of BP (TMEM14Cmut2) led to a reinforcement of AG′ usage (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, swapping the BP and BP′ sequences (TMEM14Cswap) decreased AG′ usage, which could be interpreted as a higher strength of BP′ as compared with BP to form base-pairing interactions with U2 snRNA.  We extended this finding by an in silico comparison of the sequence patterns of alternative, canonical and insensitive BPs. We show that the canonical, alternative and insensitive BP presented distinct patterns (Fig. 5a), with significant sequence differences at positions +2, +4 and +6 of the motif (+5 being the A of the BP).  These data suggest that SF3B1MUT favours the use of BP′ with stronger base-pairing potential with U2 snRNA compared with the downstream BP.  Collectively, in an SF3B1MUT context, the stronger affinity of BP′ for U2 snRNA when compared with BP may allow the use BP′ with suboptimal AG′ (not followed by G, Fig. 4b) and may explain the lower dependence of AG′ on U2AF (Fig. 4c).  Discussion Here, we addressed the consequences of SF3B1 hotspot mutations on splicing in UM and its underlying mechanisms. First, we observed that SF3B1 hotspot mutations in UM are associated with deregulation of a restricted subset (∼0.5%) of splice junctions, mostly caused by the usage of alternative 3′ss (AG′) upstream of the canonical 3′ss (AG). This finding is concordant with a recent publication12, implying the robustness of the deregulated splice pattern in SF3B1MUT tumours. Furthermore, this pattern is shared by tumours having for origin different cell lineages12,22. Second, we show here that SF3B1MUT pattern was reproduced neither by knockdown nor by overexpressing wild-type SF3B1, indicating that SF3B1 mutants could be qualified as change-of-function mutants. Third, and important, our data provide significant progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying alternative 3′ss regulation by SF3B1MUT. We show that this mechanism involves a misregulation of BP′ usage, which have been largely overlooked in previous studies of alternative splicing and have been identified only recently on a large scale13.  Based on in silico data, DeBoever et al. proposed that SF3B1MUT-induced alternative 3′ss (AG′) is located at the end of a sterically protected region in a specific region downstream the canonical BP. Yet, not every potentially well-located AG′ was used in an SF3B1MUT context, suggesting additional or different requirements for SF3B1MUT selectivity12. They hypothesized no alternative BP usage as a mechanism of AG′ selection, because of the observed limited distances between AG and AG′. Strikingly, however, we showed here that mutagenesis of the predicted BP′ and the predicted canonical BP abrogated usage of AG′ and AG, respectively, confirming the existence of two BPs differentially used according to SF3B1 status. Interestingly, since submission of our work, Darman et al. reported findings fully confirming our results. They also showed the consequences of SF3B1 mutations on transcription through the generation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay-sensitive aberrant spliced transcripts23.  Until recently, only few examples of alternative branchpoints were reported, such as in human XPC and rat fibronectin genes24,25. However in 2015, the genome-wide identification of BPs revealed that one-third (32%) of introns have at least two BPs13, but little is known about their regulation. Our findings provide the first evidence that misregulation of alternative BPs is involved in physiology or pathology.  Our findings indicate that SF3B1MUT-induced alternative 3′ss usage relies on three properties: an AG′ with lower affinity to U2AF than the canonical 3′ss, the presence of an BP′ with a higher affinity to U2 snRNA than canonical BP and the location of BP′ at a distance of 11–14 nts preceding the AG′. Based on these findings and on current understanding of SF3B1 function, we propose the following model for how SF3B1MUT exerts its effects (Fig. 6). Because BP′ potential to form base-pairing interactions with U2 snRNA is generally superior to that of canonical BP, we suggest that U2 snRNP containing SF3B1MUT has more stringent requirement for BP sequences than U2 snRNP-containing SF3B1WT. Consistently, the hotspot mutations of SF3B1 target the HEAT repeats of SF3B1, which form helical structures that occlude the binding surface for RNA recognition motif of p14, a component of U2 snRNP that binds the BP1,26. The hotspot mutations of SF3B1 in the HEAT repeats occur on the inner surface of the structure and may induce a conformational change in the U2 snRNP complex altering its selectivity for BPs. It is likely that stronger BP′ (in terms of U2 snRNA complementarity) can compensate for lower AG affinity to U2AF, leading to the recognition of BP′ in a U2AF-independent manner (or less dependent than in the case of canonical BP). This model is supported by our U2AF depletion experiments and is consistent with previous findings that BP recognition may depend or not on AG binding to U2AF35, according to BP and 3′ss sequence and organization11,16,17,18. In contrast, SF3B1WT may allow a more promiscuous binding of U2 snRNA to both canonical and alternative BPs, and in this case, the final choice of BP may be determined by context, especially 3′ss affinity for U2AF.  Figure 6: A model for alternative splicing dysregulation induced by SF3B1 hotspot mutations. Figure 6 The 3′ss contains a segment, which is rich in pyrimidines (Y), a well-conserved AG dinucleotide and a branchpoint (BP) sequence recognized by the U2 snRNP. The U2 snRNP complex binds to the intron through base-pairing interactions between the BP sequence and the U2 snRNA, and through interactions between intron sequences, SF3B1 and p14. The HEAT repeats of SF3B1 form helical structures that occlude the surface of RNA recognition motif of p14. U2 snRNP containing SF3B1WT recognizes the canonical U2AF-dependant BP. The hotspot mutations of SF3B1 targeting the HEAT repeats occur on the inner surface of the structure and might induce a conformational change in the U2 snRNP complex altering its selectivity for BPs. U2 snRNP containing SF3B1MUT has more stringent requirement for BP sequences and less for U2AF-dependent sequences, leading to the binding of alternative branchpoints (BP’) with high potential of base-pairing with U2 snRNP.

Full size image Further work is required to evaluate the molecular mechanism by which the mutations of the SF3B1 HEAT domains may influence the base-pairing potential of U2 snRNA. The functional impact of SF3B1MUT-deregulated splicing pattern on oncogenesis also remains to be understood. Meanwhile, our study opens new possibilities for applying the deregulated splicing pattern as a screening tool as well as for targeting the splicing deregulation as a therapeutic strategy in UM and other SF3B1MUT-associated diseases27.  Methods Patient cohort A series of 109 consecutive patients diagnosed for UM without metastasis at diagnosis and treated by primary enucleation at the Institut Curie between January 2006 and December 2008 was assembled. RNA extracted from the tumour specimens was qualified for 74 (74/109) cases, which defined the patient cohort for this study.  RNA samples were obtained from surgical residual tumour tissues. In accordance to the national law on the protection of individuals taking part in biomedical research, patients were informed by their referring oncologist that their biological samples could be used for research purposes and they gave their verbal informed consent. All analyses done in this work were approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of the Institut Curie Hospital Group.  DNA and RNA sequencing Tumour DNA and RNA were provided by the Biological Resource Center of the Institut Curie. The DNA was extracted from frozen tumour or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples using a standard phenol/chloroform procedure. SF3B1 was sequenced by Sanger methods as previously described5. Primers used for Sanger sequencing are: (forward) 5′-CCAACTCATGACTGTCCTTTCT-3′ and 5′-TGGAAGGCCGAGAGATCATT-3′.  The total RNA was isolated from frozen tumour samples using a NucleoSpin Kit (Macherey-Nagel). cDNA synthesis was conducted with MuLV Reverse Transcriptase in accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions (Invitrogen), with quality assessments conducted on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraries were constructed using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using a 100-bp paired-end sequencing strategy. An average depth of global sequence coverage of 114 million and a median coverage of 112 million was attained.  RNA-Seq analysis TopHat (v2.0.6)28 was used to align the reads against the human reference genome Hg19 RefSeq (RNA sequences, GRCh37) downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Read counts for splicing junctions from junctions.bed TopHat output were considered. Differential analysis was performed on junction read counts using DESeq2 (ref. 14). Only alternative acceptor splice sites (two or more 3′ss with junctions to the same 5′ss) and alternative donor splice sites (two or more 5′ss with junctions to the same 3′ss) were considered for this analysis.  Fifty-nucleotide-long sequences surrounding the splice acceptor sites were extracted to generate sequence logos using WebLog 3 (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/)29 with the default parameters, the classic colour scheme and the unit frequency being plotted as ‘probability’.  The data set supporting the results of this article is available on ArrayExpress repository under the accession E-MTAB-4097.  BP sequence analysis The online tools SVM-BPfinder20 (http://regulatorygenomics.upf.edu/Software/SVM_BP/) and the Human Splicing Finder30 (http://www.umd.be/HSF/) were used to predict the BPs. The SVM_BP code was altered to allow for BP six base pairs from the 3′ss by setting minidist3ss=6 in svm_getfeat.py.  Minigene constructs For each selected candidate gene alternative AG′-centred sequence of ∼200 nucleotides was PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of HEK293T cells using Phusion Hot Start II High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The primer sequence information is provided in Supplementary Table 2. We introduced 15 bases of homology with the ends of the linearized vector at the 5′-end of the forward and reverse primers. Using In-fusion HD cloning kit (Clontech), we cloned the amplicon into the BamH1 site of pET01 ExonTrap vector (Mobitec) containing a functional splice donor site (Supplementary Fig. 3).  Wild-type and mutated SF3B1 constructs A pCMV-3tag-1A vector containing wild-type SF3B1 was synthesized by Genscript Corporation. Because mammalian SF3B1 cDNA sequence was found unclonable in bacteria, a synthetic sequence was generated after codon-optimization for expression in bacteria. The full sequence of codon-optimized SF3B1 is available upon request. K700E mutation in SF3B1 was introduced using QuikChange II Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Primers used for generating the mutated SF3B1 are: (forward) 5′-CTGGTGGATGAGCAGCAGGAGGTCAGAACCATCTCTGC-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GCAGAGATGGTTCTGACCTCCTGCTGCTCATCCACCAG-3′.  BP mutant constructs Mutations of potential BP in TMEM14C and ENOSF1 ExonTrap constructs were introduced using QuikChange II Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. The primer sequences used to generate the mutations are provided in Supplementary Table 3.  Cell culture and transfection Mel202 cell line was purchased from the European Searchable Tumour Line Database (Tubingen University, Germany) and MP41 (derived at Institut Curie and described in ref. 31) UM cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A point mutation in SF3B1 resulting in K666T amino-acid substitution was introduced using CRISPR/CAS9-stimulated homology-mediated repair to generate isogenic HEK293T cell lines and was verified by Sanger sequencing. A donor template encoding a puromycin selection cassette was transfected at a 1:1:1 ratio with Cas9 (Addgene 41815) and a SF3B1-specific gRNA (built from gRNA cloning vector, Addgene 41824). The selection cassette was removed by flippase-mediated excision. All cell lines were tested and proved to be Mycoplasma free. Authentication of the cell lines was verified by Sanger sequencing for their mutational status and by RNA-Seq.  Plasmid transfections were carried out in cell lines using 500 ng of plasmid construct and LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h, total RNA was extracted with NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel). The quantity and quality of RNA was determined by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop Technologies). Five hundred nanograms of RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Twenty-five nanograms of the synthesized cDNA was used as a template for RT–PCR amplification with specific primers.  HEK293T and MP41 cells were transfected with the following siRNA obtained from Qiagen: SF3B1 (Cat.No. SI00715932 and Cat. No. SI04154647), U2AF1 (Cat.No. SI04158049 and Cat. No. SI04159547); U2AF2 (Cat.No. SI00754026 and Cat. No. SI04194498) or control siRNA (Cat.No. S103650318). The cells were transfected with 50 nM of siRNA using lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). After 48 h, total RNA was extracted and was used as a template for cDNA synthesis. Twenty-five nanograms of the synthesized cDNA was used for RT–PCR amplification with specific primers. PCR products were separated on a 2–3% agarose gel (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7).  Immunoblot analysis Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and proteins were quantified using a BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Equal amounts were separated on SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes followed by immunoblotting with specific primary antibodies for SF3B1 (1:1,000; #170854; Abcam), Flag (1:1,000, #3165; Sigma), U2AF1 (1:500; #19961; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), U2AF2 (1:500; #53942; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and β-actin (1:2,000; #5313; Sigma). The membrane was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with either goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse Odyssey secondary antibodies coupled to a 700 or 800 nm. Immunolabelled proteins were detected using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-cor). Quantifications were performed using the ImageJ Software. β-Actin immunoblotting was used to quantify and normalize results.  Co-immunoprecipitation HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.11.Myc-U2AF2, kindly given by Edwin Chan32, and either pCMV-3tag-1A-SF3B1WT or pCMV-3tag-1A-SF3B1K700M. After 48 h, proteins immunoprecipitated by anti-Flag gel affinity (A2220, Sigma) were separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed in a western blot assay with anti-U2AF2 and anti-U2AF1 antibody (Supplementary Fig. 8).  Fragment analysis by capillary electrophoresis Minigene fragments were amplified by RT–PCR using a 5' FAM-forward primer and reverse-specific primers (Supplementary Table 2). One microlitre of RT–PCR product was added to 18.5 μl of deionized formamide and 0.5 μl HD400 marker (Applied Biosystems). The mixture was then denatured 3 min at 95 °C, immediately put on ice, and separated using an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. The data were analysed using GeneMarker software (SoftGenetics). 
130||The RNA maturation is an important and complex biological process. It requires several small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that comprise the two forms of spliceosomes. The major form of spliceosome (U2-type) is composed of U1, U2, U4/6 and U5 snRNPs, and catalyzes most splicing events in metazoans.1  Mutations of genes, such as SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent SF1, SF3A1, U2AF2 or PRPF40B, encoding spliceosome compounds have been found to occur at high frequencies in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).2, 3, 4 Subsequently, SF3B1 mutations were also found in solid tumors such as endometrial, lung, bladder, pancreatic and breast carcinomas and cutaneous melanomas.5 We and others also reported that 15–20% of uveal melanoma (UM) carry SF3B1 mutations.6, 7, 8 SF3B1 (splicing factor 3 B subunit 1, also named SF3B155) is a central compound the U2 snRNP complex in direct contact with the branch site of the pre-mRNA. SF3B1 contains 22 HEAT repeats (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, Targets of rapamycin 1). Major hotspots of missense mutations of SF3B1 target one of the HEAT repeats at positions R625, K666 and K700, with variability according to diseases, R625 and K700 mutations being the most prevalent in UM and hematologic disorders, respectively. Prognosis value of these mutations vary according to diseases, SF3B1 mutations are associated with poor outcomes in CLL and favorable outcomes in UM.9 SF3B1 mutations are especially associated with the refractory anemia with excess of ring sideroblasts (RARS), a mild form of MDS with little impact on patient’s survival. Consequences of these mutations on splicing are less clear. Aberrant splicing associated with SF3B1 was reported by two landmark publications.2, 3 However, little overlap was found between MDS and CLL. Furthermore, Harbour et al.6 found no splicing effect of SF3B1 mutations in a series of UM patients analyzed by RNA-seq. By combining exon array and RNA-seq analyzes, we recently reported alternative transcripts of eight genes statistically associated with SF3B1 R625 mutations and linked to various RNA processing mechanisms: alternative terminal exons (UQCC, ADAM12, GAS8), alternative 3′ acceptor splice sites (CRNDE, ANKHD1), alternative cassette exons (GUSBP1), alternative first exon (F8) and intron retention (ABCC5).7  Five of these differential splicing events (CRNDE, GUSBP11, UQCC, ABCC5 and ANKHD1) were most consistently associated with the SF3B1-mutated status. Here we explored whether this splicing signature was also associated with SF3B1 mutations in malignancies other than UM, namely in MDS and CLL.  Series of CLL (26 cases), MDS of various subtypes (48 cases) and UM (87 cases) were assembled. These samples were genotyped for the recurrent mutated genes of the spliceosome, and biological and clinical data were obtained (see Supplementary Table for sample characteristics). After RNA extraction and reverse transcription, samples were analyzed for the two splice forms of UQCC, CRNDE, ANKHD1, GUSBP1 and ABCC5 by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) as described previously.7 CRNDE was poorly expressed in CLL, below the detection sensitivity of the RT-QPCR in most cases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied on the splicing ratio of the five expressed genes obtained for the series of MDS and CLL data, as well as with that of the series of UM previously reported.7 Whereas no disease aggregation was observed in the clustering, all SF3B1-mutated samples clustered in a single branch (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table for complete sample status). More specifically, this group of samples included 8 CLL SF3B1-mutated samples (K700E (6), K666T (1) and G742D (1)), 24 MDS SF3B1-mutated sample cases (K700E (14), H622Q (4), D781G (2), R625L/H/D/C (4)) and 19 SF3B1-mutated UM samples (R625H/C/L/P (16), K666M/T (2), K700E (1)). As expected, most SF3B1-mutated MDS were classified as RARS or refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (16 and 4, respectively out of 23 cases). No SF3B1-mutated samples were misclassified, except one MDS sample, MDS44 and one UM case, UM48, with low but detectable frequencies of mutated SF3B1 allele, which segregated with wild-type cases. Five cases without detected splicesome mutations (one MDS, two UM and two CLL) clustered in this branch corresponding to the mutated samples. The three SRSF2-mutated MDS cases, bearing the P95H hotspot mutation, segregated in the second branch with the wild-type samples, suggesting that this mutant-splicing factor differently affects the splicing process than the SF3B1 mutants. Two MDS samples bearing ZRSR2 missense mutations of unknown functional consequences (K413E and V304M) segregated each in a different branch.  Figure 1.

An unsupervised hierarchical clustering and a heatmap are performed using the difference in Ct (threshold cycle) between the two splicing forms expression for the five genes, measured by RT-QPCR for a series of 161 tumor samples representing 3 pathologies: uveal melanoma (UM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Data were normalized on mean and standard deviation within each pathology and research center. Clustering was performed based on Euclidian distance by Ward’s method.

NA, not available.  Full figure and legend (124K)  Several conclusions could be drawn from these results. First, it is the first time that consistent splicing abnormalities are associated with SF3B1 mutations. The fact that the same splicing pattern is observed in tumor cells from different lineages and embryonic origins, strongly argues for a direct consequence of SF3B1 mutation. Second, the same pattern is observed irrespective of the mutated HEAT repeats of SF3B1. The reason for different hotspot mutations in different malignancies is largely unexplained but no different consequence was detected in the limited splicing events explored here. Third, the other mutated spliceosome compounds present in our series, including SRSF2 and ZRSR2, did not share the splicing abnormalities of the SF3B1 mutants. Finally, while no false negative was present in the clustering, the splicing pattern of 5 out of 161 samples from the three series was undistinguishable from that of SF3B1 samples, suggesting either experimental limitation of our splicing analysis or undetected abnormalities of the splicing machinery.  Our data clearly associate specific splicing abnormalities to SF3B1 mutations but these abnormalities are most probably not limited to those analyzed here. To statistically demonstrate splicing variants among more than 200 000 different splicing events remains challenging. It requires reliable molecular tools such as the latest generation of exon array or RNA-seq, efficient bioinformatics and large series of cases. It is thus likely that only the most consistent events were picked by the analysis of a limited number of mutated cases. Splicing forms yet to be discovered may better explain the oncogenic pathways activated by mutant SF3B1. Finally, our results do not rule out functions of SF3B1 besides splicing, which deregulations could intervene in oncogenesis.   Graphical Abstract Image for unlabelled figure Figure options  Introduction RNA splicing, a highly regulated molecular event orchestrated by the spliceosome, involves the removal of intronic sequences from pre-mRNA and the ligation of exons to generate mature mRNA (Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009). This process can result in multiple mRNAs being produced from a single gene providing increased protein diversity in cells. Dysregulation of RNA splicing has been identified as a causative defect in several diseases (Dehm, 2013 ;  Singh and Cooper, 2012). Furthermore, dysregulated alternative splicing has been proposed to play an important role in tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy; however, in many cases, the molecular consequences of dysregulated splicing in cancer have remained largely elusive (Zhang and Manley, 2013). Recently, recurrent heterozygous mutations were identified in components of the spliceosome in various tumor types suggesting that somatic mutations in spliceosome genes play an important role in cancer (Yoshida and Ogawa, 2014). SF3B1 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene with particular enrichment in diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, uveal melanoma (UVM), skin melanoma (SKCM), and breast (BRCA) and pancreatic cancers ( Biankin et al., 2012; Ellis et al., 2012; Harbour et al., 2013; Kong et al., 2014; Landau et al., 2013; Malcovati et al., 2015 ;  Yoshida et al., 2011). Based on the high frequency of SF3B1 mutations and the key role in splicing of this protein, we sought to study the molecular and functional consequences of SF3B1 hotspot mutations on RNA splicing in cell lines and patient samples.  Splicing takes place after the recognition of consensus sequences near the 5′ and 3′ ends of introns, known as 5′ and 3′ splice sites (ss), by the splicing machinery. U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) recognizes the 5′ ss, whereas U2 snRNP is directed to the appropriate 3′ ss by short, conserved pre-mRNA sequences, including a branch point sequence (BPS), the polypyrimidine (Py) tract, and the AG dinucleotide at the intron-exon junction. Prior to U2 snRNP recruitment, SF1 recognizes the BPS, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) large subunit (U2AF2) recognizes the Py tract, and U2AF small subunit (U2AF1) recognizes the AG dinucleotide. Subsequently, the U2 snRNP replaces SF1 in an ATP-dependent process that facilitates protein and RNA rearrangements. In particular, the N terminus of SF3B1, a U2 snRNP component, has been shown to bind with U2AF2, whereas the SF3B1 C terminus along with another U2 snRNP component, p14, interacts with the BPS and nearby pre-mRNA sequences (Gozani et al., 1998). In addition, U2 snRNP and pre-mRNA complex is stabilized by a base-paired duplex between the U2 snRNA and the BPS. The subsequent binding of U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP induces structural rearrangements that lead to activation of two catalytic steps that generate the lariat intermediate and subsequent final exon-exon product (Horowitz, 2012; Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009).  The recurrent hotspot mutations in SF3B1 are found exclusively in the C-terminal HEAT domains (residues 622–781; Figure S1A). Though there has been lack of structural information on how SF3B1 interacts with pre-mRNA, previous cryo-electron microscopy studies suggest that SF3B1 may undergo a conformational change to a more open form that enables mRNA binding and BPS recognition by the U2 snRNP (Golas et al., 2003). Although it was previously reported by several groups that SF3B1 mutant-positive cancers are associated with aberrant splicing (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013), here, we show that SF3B1 hotspot mutations (SF3B1MUT) result in neomorphic activity causing aberrant splicing. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ ss selection through the use of a branch point (BP) different from the BP utilized by SF3B1 wild-type (SF3B1WT) and that SF3B1MUT still requires the canonical Py tract for the formation of the active spliceosome to induce aberrant splicing. We predict that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced mRNAs are subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that multiple aberrant transcripts are degraded, resulting in downregulation of the associated canonical protein in cell line models and patient samples. These insights into the splicing aberrations induced by SF3B1MUT will enable discovery of downstream consequences that contribute to neoplasms and the discovery of targeted therapeutic approaches for SF3B1MUT cancers.  Results SF3B1MUT Tumor-Specific Splicing Defects  To provide a more complete understanding of the splicing aberrations observed in SF3B1MUT cancers, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from different tumor types were analyzed using a bioinformatic pipeline that we developed in order to quantify exon-exon junctions without the need of predetermined alternative splicing models or annotated splice junctions. The analysis pipeline was applied to CLL patient samples (7 SF3B1MUT and 6 SF3B1WT) and a number of samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas: luminal A primary BRCA (7 SF3B1K700E and 14 SF3B1WT), SKCM (3 SF3B1MUT and 12 SF3B1WT), and UVM (18 SF3B1MUT and 18 SF3B1WT) (Table S1). This analysis revealed 895 aberrant splice junctions to be significantly upregulated in SF3B1MUT compared to SF3B1WT of which 534 events (∼60%) were unique as they had not been previously annotated in major transcriptome databases. The majority of aberrant splicing events observed were aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures 1A and S1B; Table S2), consistent with previous observations (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013).

Box plots and whiskers are represented as per the Tukey method. See also Figure S1 and Tables S2 and S3. Figure options Unsupervised clustering was applied to the identified aberrant junctions and it led to clustering of SF3B1MUT samples distinct from the cluster of SF3B1WT samples (Figure 1B), with the exception of two SF3B1MUT samples (TCGA-D8-A1JH and TCGA-ER-A19S) that clustered with the SF3B1WT samples. This was likely driven by low mutant allele fractions (7% and 14%, respectively) when compared with a range of 25%–52% for other samples (Figure 1B; Table S2). Moreover, samples with SF3B1MUT clustered within each tumor type (BRCA, SKCM, UVM, and CLL), each showing a set of unique aberrantly spliced junctions (Figures 1B and S1C). A set of “common” events (i.e., events found in all tumor types) were observed, consistent with a small overlap of splicing abnormalities found in CLL and UVM described in two previous reports (Furney et al., 2013). The pattern of tumor-specific splicing in BRCA and CLL could, at least in part, be explained by the increased expression of the genes that are aberrantly spliced in these tumor types compared to the other diseases (p = 7.5022 × 10−05 and p = 1.0078 × 10−36, respectively); however, the same was not observed for SKCM and UVM (Figure 1C; Table S3). This suggests that additional mechanisms, such as tissue-specific splicing regulation, might contribute to these patterns.  Using the aberrant junctions identified in the previous analysis, we extended the clustering analysis to include 14 MDS RARS samples (12 SF3B1MUT) and an additional 19 samples from TCGA with miscellaneous SF3B1 mutations (Table S1). For the MDS samples, relatively low sequencing depth and inclusion of just two SF3B1WT samples precluded their use for the discovery of MDS-specific aberrant junctions. While all SF3B1MUT MDS patients and three BRCA patients (p.N626D, p.D781E, and p.K666E) clustered with the original SF3B1MUT sample set, 16 SF3B1 mutant patients clustered with SF3B1WT samples (Figure S1D). These patient samples carried mutations in SF3B1 (“Non-hotspot” in Figure S1D and Table S1) that are not co-localized with the hotspot mutations in the HEAT domain. These analyses strongly suggest a convergence of mechanism and downstream splicing effects induced by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1 Mutations Induce Aberrant mRNA Splicing in Human and Mouse Cells  To study SF3B1MUT in vitro, a pancreatic cancer cell line carrying endogenous SF3B1 mutations (Panc05.04: p.Q699H and p.K700E) was utilized. In addition, the p.K700E, p.K666N, or p.H662Q mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E, Nalm-6 SF3B1K666N, Nalm-6 SF3B1H662Q) or a synonymous mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700K, referred as SF3B1WT) was introduced by AAV-mediated homology to the Nalm-6 pre-B cell line to produce isogenic matched cell lines. Unsupervised clustering of these cell lines and a panel of several SF3B1WT pancreatic cancer cell lines using the aberrant splice junctions identified in patient samples resulted in clear segregation of SF3B1MUT cell lines from SF3B1WT cells (Figure 2A). A similar increase in aberrant splice junctions observed in RNA-seq data analysis was confirmed in Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells using a Nanostring assay developed to quantify aberrant splice junctions (Figure S2A). Panc05.04 cells carry the hotspot mutation p.K700E and a mutation at position 699 (p.Q699H) that is not observed in patient samples. When the p.Q699H and p.K700E were expressed alone or in combination in 293FT cells, only cells expressing p.K700E and p.Q699H/p.K700E induced aberrant splicing indicating that p.Q699H does not appear to affect this aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures S2B and S2C). These data confirm that Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1MUT cell lines are representative models to study the splicing functional activity of SF3B1MUT in vitro.

Data are represented as mean of three biological replicates. Data are presented in box plots as boxes in the first and third quartiles, midline as the median, and whiskers extending to the range excluding outliers. See also Figure S2. Figure options To confirm that additional cancer-associated SF3B1 hotspot mutations induced aberrant splicing, we expressed various mxSF3B1MUT, mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R in 293FT cells (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for a description of mxSF3B1; Figure S2D) and analyzed splicing aberrations by Nanostring. The p.K700R mutation served as a negative control as it doesn’t introduce a major change in charge or size of the amino acid and is not disease associated. All SF3B1MUT tested demonstrated the same usage of aberrant splice sites observed in endogenous and engineered cell lines; however, the SF3B1K700R or SF3B1WT did not show these splicing changes (Figure 2B). Moreover, the expression of any of the SF3B1 constructs did not change the overall expression (sum of aberrant and canonical) of affected genes (Figure 2B). To further confirm the correlation between expression of SF3B1 p.K700E mutation and aberrant splicing, tetracycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to selectively knockdown (KD) the SF3B1MUT or SF3B1WT allele in Panc05.04 and Panc10.05 (SF3B1MUT and SF3B1WT cells). After confirmation of KD efficiency (Figures S2E–S2H), RNA isolated from treated cells was analyzed by Nanostring. Depletion of the SF3B1MUT allele in Panc05.04 resulted in downregulation of aberrant splice isoforms, whereas an accumulation of aberrant splice isoforms was observed with selective SF3B1WT allele depletion (Figures 2C and 2D), indicating that SF3B1MUT was responsible for the appearance of aberrant splicing. These results were also supported by the expression of a pan shRNA or depletion of SF3B1WT in the Panc10.05 where no effect on aberrant splicing was observed (Figures 2C and 2D). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT acquires a neomorphic function and may also lose wild-type splicing activity. This observation was also supported by the recent paper by Zhou et al. proposing that in a different SF3B1 mutant cell line (ESS1) wild-type SF3B1 was required for survival (Zhou et al., 2015).  SF3B1MUT Recognizes a Cryptic 3′ AG with a Short and Weak Py Tract  The most common splicing abnormality observed in SF3B1MUT cells was the usage of an aberrant 3′ ss. To understand the sequence features and the mechanism by which mutant SF3B1 would induce aberrant splicing, computational analysis of SF3B1MUT patient data and minigene assay validation methods were utilized. First, an enrichment of the cryptic AGs was determined to be located between −15 and −24 nt upstream of the canonical 3′ ss in SF3B1MUT patient samples (Figure 3A). In contrast, the first AG (but not GAG) upstream of a canonical AG in RefSeq showed a much lower density in this region and a wider distribution. Interestingly, the motif sequences associated with the cryptic and canonical AGs showed several different features. Upstream of the canonical AGs, a clear enrichment of pyrimidines was observed in agreement with the presence of a Py tract, whereas the cryptic AGs were associated with a short and weak Py tract and an enrichment of adenines (A) that are possibly important for BPS selection. In contrast, no clear features were associated with the first upstream AGs in RefSeq (Figures 3B and S3). Interestingly, similar features, such as the position of cryptic AG between −15 and −24, the presence of a short and weak Py tract, and an enrichment of As were observed in aberrant 3′ spliced junctions detected in NIH 3T3 mouse cells overexpressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures S4A–S4C). While similar features associated with aberrant splice junction usage were observed in mxSF3B1K700E mouse cells, the overlap of affected junctions observed in human cells was low due to low sequence similarity of introns between species (Figure S4D; Table S4). An exception was observed for the UXS1 gene for which the junction between exon 2 and exon 3 is conserved among different species ( Figure S4E). These data strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant splicing in the presence of competing 3′ ss via a sequence-dependent feature located within the intron and preferentially recognizes cryptic splice sites with weaker Py tract in close proximity to an enrichment of As.

Shown here is a representative ethidium-bromide-stained 2.5% agarose gel of the indicated RT-PCR reactions of mRNA isolated from transfected cells. See also Figures S4 and S5 and Table S4. Figure options To confirm the importance of these specific sequence features, we selected the exon 9/exon 10 junction in ZDHHC16 to develop a minigene as it was observed to be aberrantly spliced among all the SF3B1 hotspot mutant samples analyzed. In addition, several alterations in the cryptic 3′ ss, the length/strength of the Py tracts, and the potential BPS were tested ( Figure S5A). Splicing was assessed by RT-PCR using cDNA prepared from 293FT cells co-transfected with ZDHHC16 minigene and mxSF3B1 plasmid. As expected, when the ZDHHC16 exon 9, intron 9 and exon 10 (E9-I9-E10) minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, only canonical splicing was observed, whereas in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E and all the other hotspot mutations, both canonical and aberrant splicing was detected (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 4 and 5; Figure S5B). Interestingly, once the cryptic AG was removed (E9-I9NoAG-E10), aberrant splicing was not observed even in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that the cryptic AG is necessary for aberrant splicing. To understand whether exonic sequences play a role in aberrant splicing, we looked at the preceding junction in ZDHHC16 (E8-I8-E9). As expected, no aberrant splicing was observed when this minigene was co-transfected with any of the mxSF3B1 constructs (Figure 3D, lanes 10 and 11). Canonical and aberrant splicing was detected when intron 8 between exon 8 and 9 was replaced with intron 9 (E8-I9-E9) in the ZDHHC16 minigene and co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, but not when co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R (Figure 3D, lanes 12 and 13). These results agree with the computational analysis suggesting that the cryptic AG is necessary and the intronic features are sufficient to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  Identification of the 3′ ss occurs during early assembly of the spliceosome, in particular when the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex recognizes the Py tract and AG, and then again when the AG is recognized during the second step of splicing (Horowitz, 2012). To understand if the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is sufficient to recruit the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex, the length/strength of the canonical Py tract was reduced from 19 nt to 10, 6, and 2 nt (PyT 10n, PyT 6n, and PyT 2n, respectively) or the weak and short cryptic Py tract was replaced with a strong Py tract (SELEX) (Figure S5A) (Lim et al., 2011). When the minigene PyT 2n (or PyT 10n and PyT 6n, in Figure S5C) was co-transfected with the mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, the splicing event occurred with selection of a new cryptic 3′ ss within exon 10 positioned 54 nt downstream of the canonical 3′ ss (sequencing data not shown), suggesting that the PyT 2n was not recognized by U2AF complex (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15; Figure S5C). This is in agreement with previous reports suggesting that Py tract length and strength are necessary for the recruitment of U2AF2/U2AF1 to guide splicing to occur at that position (Coolidge et al., 1997). Surprisingly, when the same minigenes were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, similar results were observed and splicing occurred within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15), suggesting that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is not sufficient to recruit the U2AF complex and that the cryptic AG requires the downstream canonical Py tract to induce aberrant splicing. The nucleotide base upstream of the AG dinucleotide has been reported to be critical for U2AF1 interaction in early recognition of 3′ ss and is usually a T/C in consensus sequences (Ilagan et al., 2015). Hence, introduction of a G upstream of the canonical or cryptic AG (−3 T > G or −24 C > G) would potentially abolish their use as a 3′ ss, respectively. When −3 T > G minigene was co-transfected with either mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E constructs, splicing was observed within exon 10, similar to PyT 2n, suggesting again that the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex needs to be recruited at the canonical AG during first step of splicing to allow usage of the cryptic AG by SF3B1MUT (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 16 and 17). Interestingly, when −24 C > G minigene was used, only canonical splicing was observed, even after mxSF3B1K700E expression (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 8 and 9). These data suggest that the −3 position relative to cryptic AG is also important when the cryptic 3′ ss is recognized during the second transesterification reaction of splicing. Moreover, when the short and weak cryptic Py tract was replaced with a SELEX Py tract, the cryptic AG was used as the preferred 3′ ss by cells expressing both mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 18 and 19). Taken together, these data support the notion that the sequence features required by SF3B1MUT-containing U2 snRNP complex are located within the intron and that the cryptic AG and the downstream canonical Py tract are required to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1MUT Utilizes a Different BPS  The computational analysis of motifs near the 3′ ss showed an enrichment of As upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse mutant SF3B1 cells, suggesting the importance of this sequence for the SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 complex. DeBoever and colleagues suggested that these were the BPSs for the mutant and wild-type SF3B1 complexes using a BPS prediction algorithm (DeBoever et al., 2015). Instead, we used the recently mapped BPS data using K562 SF3B1WT cells and overlaid these data with introns in which the aberrant splice junctions were observed in SF3B1MUT cells (Mercer et al., 2015). A total of 151 BPs were mapped among 93 introns; 60 introns have only one identified BP, and another 33 introns contain multiple reported BPs. The distribution of these BPs with respect to the cryptic AG indicated that the majority of BPs overlapped with the A of the cryptic AG or were in close proximity (between 1, cryptic A and −5), but did not coincide with the enrichment of As observed in the motif analysis (Figure 4A). The enrichment of As was observed between −8 and −18 nt upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse cells expressing mutant SF3B1 (Figures 4B and S4C). This suggests that these As could play an important role for SF3B1MUT function. To test this hypothesis, the 3 As located between −33 and −35 were mutated to Gs in the ZDHHC16 minigene (−33 to −35 AAA > GGG; Figure 4C and S5A). When this minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT and mxSF3B1K700R, canonical splicing was observed, suggesting that these As are not part of the BPS for wild-type U2 complex (Figure 4D, lanes 11 and 12). Instead, when the cells were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, canonical splicing was observed without any aberrant splicing, indicating that the three As are probably part of the BPS used by the U2 mutant complex (Figure 4D, lane 12). To identify the BPS used by the U2 wild-type complex, the A at position −26 and −30 alone or together were mutated to G (−26 A > G, −30 A > G and −26, −30 AA > GG; Figure 4C). When the A at position −26 alone or both −26 and −30 were mutated to G and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, splicing was observed within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10), suggesting that this is likely the BPS for SF3B1WT, but not for SF3B1K700E, as canonical and aberrant splicing was observed in these conditions (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10). Interestingly, when the minigene with the A at position −30 alone was mutated to G (Figure 4C and S5A) and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R splicing was observed mostly within exon 10 and when co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, only aberrant splicing was observed (Figure 4D, lanes 7 and 8). As expected, when all the As were mutated to Gs (all A > G, Figures 4C and S5A), each mxSF3B1 construct spliced within exon 10 (Figure 4D, lanes 13 and 14). Additionally, this outcome was confirmed by mapping the two different BPs using nested PCR analysis and sequencing of endogenous ZDHHC16 intron 9 lariat in K562 isogenic cells ( Figure 4E). Unlike in SF3B1WT cells, we observed at least two major templates with different sequences in the SF3B1K700E cells due to a mixed population of SF3B1WT and SF3B1MUT proteins. Through analysis and matching of expected transcript sequences using Mutation Surveyor, we found that −34 A and −30 A were the BPs used for SF3B1K700E and SF3B1WT, respectively. To extend our observation, we also mapped BPs in four additional genes that are aberrantly spliced in presence of SF3B1K700E: TMEM14C (intron 1), SEPT6 (intron 9), DLST (intron 5), and DIP2A (intron 23) ( Table S5). These results prove that the SF3B1 wild-type and mutant-containing U2 complexes are able to use two different BPs.  SF3B1MUT Uses a Different BPS than SF3B1WT(A) Relative positions of mapped BP ...

Figure options Aberrant Transcripts Generated by SF3B1MUT Are Subjected to NMD  Erroneous or aberrant mRNAs that contain a premature termination codon are subjected to NMD to prevent potential deleterious effects of their translation to proteins (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Computational analysis revealed that the majority of cryptic AGs were located upstream of canonical 3′ ss at nucleotide distances that were not multiples of 3 (Figure 5A). This result suggested that the aberrant transcripts would have a higher probability to be out of frame and therefore degraded by NMD. To confirm that predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts were degraded by the NMD pathway, RNA-seq was performed on Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells treated with cycloheximide, a translation inhibitor known to inhibit NMD (Singh et al., 2012). Bioinformatic prediction analysis revealed that 44% of all aberrant mRNAs identified in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cell lines would result in an NMD-sensitive transcript (Rivas et al., 2015) (Figure 5B; Tables S6 and S7). RNA-seq analysis from Nalm-6 isogenic cells demonstrated that NMD-sensitive genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E than Nalm-6 SF3B1WT (p = 1.06 × 10−12), whereas predicted NMD-insensitive genes were expressed at similar levels (Figure 5C). RNA-seq analysis identified 41 predicted NMD-sensitive genes to be both downregulated in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E and to have increased abundance following cycloheximide treatment (Figure 5D; Table S6), suggesting that these aberrant transcripts were degraded by the NMD. In addition, to evaluate if this would result in downregulation of the associated canonical protein, stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) with subsequent mass spectrometry was used to quantify protein levels in Nalm-6 isogenic lines (Oda et al., 1999)· Eleven predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts for which peptides could be detected in Nalm-6 SF3B1WT were selected for evaluation, and ten were found to have decreased peptide counts by at least 2- to 8-fold (e.g., ABCB7, AKAP8L; Figure 6A). Decreased expression of canonical proteins was confirmed by western blot analysis using available antibodies, such as MZB1, PHGDH, and SEPT6 (Figure 6B). Among the downregulated proteins in the SILAC experiment were two proteins of particular interest: MZB1 and ABCB7. MZB1 is a B cell-specific and ER-localized protein implicated in antibody secretion and integrin-mediated cell adhesion (van Anken et al., 2009). As shown in Figure 6C, MZB1 was aberrantly spliced in SF3B1K700E cells and the canonical isoform was clearly downregulated at transcript and protein level (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6D). As shown in Figure 6E, clear downregulation of canonical MZB1 protein level was also observed in four out of five CLL patients with SF3B1MUT, but not in SF3B1WT samples. The result for patient 8 could be explained by the low allele fraction for Y623C (10%), and this was associated with undetectable aberrant splicing for ZDHHC16 and no change in canonical MZB1 when compared with one of the SF3B1WT patients (Figure S6). ABCB7 is a mediator of iron accumulation and erythroid growth and has been reported to be downregulated specifically in an MDS subtype characterized by refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (Boultwood et al., 2008). Interestingly, SF3B1 mutations have been found at a frequency of 80%–90% in RARS, but not in other MDS subtypes (Papaemmanuil et al., 2011). In addition, a partial loss-of-function mutation in ABCB7 has been identified in X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia demonstrating an iron-overload phenotype in cells with defective ABCB7 (Allikmets et al., 1999). We identified that ABCB7 is aberrantly spliced in SF3B1 mutant cells (Figure 6F) and demonstrated that the aberrant transcript is subject to NMD, causing downregulation of the canonical transcript and protein (Figures 6A and 6D). Therefore, aberrant splicing and subsequent NMD of ABCB7 likely explains the association between ABCB7 downregulation observed in RARS and the presence of SF3B1 mutants. Taken together, these data suggest that SF3B1MUT might contribute to the phenotypes observed in diseases by inducing the generation of NMD-sensitive transcripts through aberrant splicing and to a subsequent reduction in the levels of the corresponding proteins.  44% of All Aberrantly Spliced Genes Are Putative Targets of NMD(A) Frequency of ...

See also Figure S6. Figure options Discussion In the current study, we describe the mechanism by which SF3B1 hotspot mutations induce aberrant splicing and the fate of resulting NMD-sensitive aberrant mRNAs in several cancer types. These mutations are associated with the expression of hundreds of aberrantly spliced junctions, mostly by utilizing a cryptic AG. While some aberrant junctions are common across different cancer types, others are tumor specific, which in some cases is a consequence of tissue-specific gene expression; however, additional factors likely contribute to these differences. Interestingly, aberrant splicing was observed only in patients carrying hotspot mutations located in the C-terminal HEAT domains, but not in samples from “non-hotspot” patients, as they clustered with the SF3B1WT patients in aberrant junction usage comparisons. The majority of these non-hotspot mutations are located away from the HEAT repeat domains, which suggests that they may have different effects on cancer cells or simply are passenger mutations, and are not the focus of the present study. We calculated an electrostatic potential map based on a homology model of SF3B1WT with importin-β and observed that all hotspot mutations are co-localized in a limited, positively charged region even though they are distributed across five different HEAT domains (Figure 7A). Furthermore, while there are various amino acid substitutions at the hotspots that result in change of size and/or polarity of side chains, our data suggest the functional consequences on splicing for these changes are similar. We show that hotspot SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ splicing in junctions associated with specific sequence features: an enrichment of As followed by a short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG located −15 to −24 nt from the canonical 3′ ss.

The position of the hotspot mutations located in the five HEAT repeat domains (highlighted in yellow) is represented in the inset. (B and C) Schematic representation of splicing in SF3B1WT (B) and SF3B1MUT (C) cells and molecular consequences of transcripts is also shown. Figure options Based on computational analysis, it was recently suggested that SF3B1 mutations cause a change in the size of the sterically protected region downstream of the BP without any altered BP recognition allowing the utilization of the cryptic AG (DeBoever et al., 2015). It was also suggested that SF3B1 mutations could alter interactions with U2AF2, affecting the ability to recognize the canonical 3′ ss and leading to cryptic 3′ ss selection. In contrast, we provide experimental evidence that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is insufficient for the recruitment of the U2AF complex and that the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss, and thereby interaction with U2AF2 is required to observe aberrant splicing as well. In addition, we have demonstrated that the SF3B1MUT U2 complex utilizes a BP that is different from the one used by the wild-type U2 complex (proposed model, Figures 7B and 7C). Based on these data and the restricted localization of the hotspot mutations, we hypothesize that SF3B1MUT interacts differently with the pre-mRNA or splicing factors that are important for the recognition of AG during the second step of splicing. The close proximity of the two mapped BPs for ZDHHC16 (−30A for SF3B1WT and −34A for SF3B1MUT) reported here (Figure 4E) and the published data on the crosslinking of SF3B1 to bases flanking the BPS (Gozani et al., 1998) would suggest a competition between the SF3B1WT- and SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 snRNP complexes to select the canonical or cryptic AG for splicing, respectively. The mechanism by which SF3B1MUT favors selection of a different BP can only be speculated at this point. Based on our data and a previous study investigating spliceostatin A’s mechanism of action (Corrionero et al., 2011), there are at least two hypotheses: the selection of the new BP is guided by SF3B1MUT through enhanced direct interactions with specific nucleotides flanking the new BPS compensating for reduced base pairing with U2 snRNA or by the base pairing of U2 snRNA with the new/suboptimal BPS compensating for impaired interactions of SF3B1MUT across the canonical BPS.  Although SF3B1MUT does not seem to affect the pre-assembly of U2 snRNP (preliminary data not shown), it is possible that the interactions with splicing factors involved in selection of an alternative AG in the second step of splicing are impaired. Previously, it has been reported that the second step splicing factor, Slu7, is required for correct 3′ ss selection (Chua and Reed, 1999a ;  Chua and Reed, 1999b). Similar to U2AF1, Slu7 harbors a Zn knuckle domain, and it is conceivable that it directly interacts with AG during the second step of splicing. As observed in the case of SF3B1MUT, depletion of Slu7 results in selection of a cryptic AG closer to the BPS. This suggests that SF3B1 hotspot mutations may impair the recruitment of Slu7 to the catalytic core. Additionally, it has been reported that splicing factor SPF45 (hSPF45 is RBM17) is involved in recognition and activation of an alternative AG upstream of the canonical 3′ ss. It has been suggested that SPF45 directly or indirectly binds to the upstream alternative AG with the help of SF3B1 and promotes its utilization during the second catalytic step (Corsini et al., 2007 ;  Lallena et al., 2002). Interestingly, as observed in the present study for SF3B1MUT, SPF45 also depends on the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss to splice at the alternative AG. Since SF3B1MUT binds at a different BPS, it can be speculated that the recruited SPF45 can access the cryptic AG which is otherwise prevented due to the steric hindrance by SF3B1WT. Taken together, the SF3B1 hotspot mutations could be facilitating SPF45 activity and/or abrogating Slu7 activity for selection of the aberrant AG, thereby providing an unanticipated mechanism for regulation of splice site utilization.  Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is a known cellular mechanism that adds complexity and flexibility in gene expression to induce stage-specific patterns not only by inducing expression of a particular isoform but also by engaging NMD to downregulate gene expression (Ge and Porse, 2014 ;  Kalyna et al., 2012). Here, we predicted that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced transcripts in SF3B1MUT cells are NMD sensitive, and we have demonstrated that the associated canonical isoforms are downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels. The downregulation of a large number of genes induced by this “spliceosome sickness” could be the cause of impaired cell functions that contribute to cancer phenotypes and potentially create dependency on essential genes or pathways for survival. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency is a proposed mechanism for disease pathogenesis in MDS, where chromosome 5q is deleted and decreased expression of genes located on the remaining chromosome is observed (e.g., RPS14 and CSKN1A1; Ebert et al., 2008 ;  Schneider et al., 2014). It is plausible that SF3B1 mutations contribute to MDS in a similar fashion by downregulating expression of certain genes resulting in a non-classical path to haploinsufficiency. In addition to the downregulation of canonical proteins, it is also possible that NMD-insensitive aberrant transcripts are translated into aberrant proteins that have altered function. Proteomic analysis of isogenic SF3B1MUT cells did not reveal the presence of aberrant proteins (data not shown), but this may be due to limitations of assay sensitivity, and additional targeted SILAC or deep RNA sequencing of active ribosome fractions may have the required sensitivity to detect such proteins. Recently, several groups reported the molecular consequences and phenotypic effects of other spliceosome mutations, such as U2AF1 and the exonic splicing enhancer binding serine/arginine-rich protein SRSF2 ( Ilagan et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015 ;  Shirai et al., 2015). Though there are some overlaps in genes differentially spliced in tissues affected by each spliceosome mutation, we see only minimal overlaps in predicted NMD targets (Figure S7). However, mutations in all three splicing factors are observed in MDS and are mutually exclusive, suggesting that some of the downstream effects might be common. Thus, while not explored in this study, it is likely that SF3B1 mutations result in defects in hematopoiesis, as has been observed in animal models of SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations. Additional work is ongoing to define the downstream splicing abnormalities that drive the phenotypic effects of spliceosome mutations. Finally, it is also plausible that mutations in SF3B1 impact other proposed splicing regulators (e.g., chromatin, histone modifications), and these should be the subject of future study ( de Almeida et al., 2011; Kfir et al., 2015 ;  Khan et al., 2013).  In summary, computational and experimental approaches were used to demonstrate that SF3B1MUT utilizes a different BP to induce aberrant splicing across multiple cancer types. These insights describe a neomorphic activity for SF3B1 mutations that causes downregulation of canonical protein expression. Furthermore, these studies provide a foundation for the potential discovery of targeted approaches for the treatment of patients carrying SF3B1 hotspot mutations.  Uveal melanoma, the most common eye malignancy causes severe visual morbidity and is fatal in about 50% of patients. Primary uveal melanoma can be cured by surgery or radiotherapy, but the metastatic disease is treatment refractory. To understand comprehensively uveal melanoma genetics, we performed SNP arrays and whole genome sequencing on 12 primary uveal melanomas. We observed only ~2000 predicted somatic single nucleotide variants per tumor and low levels of aneuploidy. We did not observe an ultraviolet radiation DNA-damage signature, but identified SF3B1 mutations in three samples and a further 15 mutations in an extension cohort of 105 samples. SF3B1 mutations were associated with good prognosis and were rarely coincident with BAP1 mutations. SF3B1 encodes a component of the spliceosome and RNA sequencing revealed that SF3B1 mutations were associated with differential alternative splicing of protein coding genes including ABCC5 and UQCC, and of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) CRNDE.  Keywords: uveal melanoma, whole genome sequencing, GNAQ/GNA11, SF3B1 Go to: Introduction Uveal melanoma arises in the iris, cilliary body and choroid. Light skin complexion, fair hair, blue eyes and the presence of cutaneous nevi are risk factors in uveal melanoma (1), but the UVR-associated increase in cutaneous melanoma that occurred in countries such as Australia over the past 4 decades has not been accompanied by parallel increases in uveal melanoma (2–4). Thus the role of UVR in uveal melanoma etiology is unclear.  Class 1 uveal melanomas present a low risk of metastasis, whereas class 2 tumors are highly metastatic and are characterized by monosomy of chromosome 3 and gain of 8q. Mutually exclusive mutations in GNAQ or GNA11, the principal driver oncogenes in uveal melanoma, occur in ~85% of cases (5, 6), and inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor BAP1 occur in ~85% of metastatic tumors and are associated with disease dissemination (7). Recently, exome sequencing of uveal melanomas has identified recurrent mutations in EIF1AX and SF3B1 (8, 9), predominantly in low grade tumors. Somatic mutations in SF3B1, which encodes a component of the spliceosome, also occur in hematological, breast and pancreatic cancers (10–13). Mutant SF3B1 is associated with differential gene splicing in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (14), but aberrant splicing in SF3B1 mutant uveal melanoma has not been reported (9).  To gain insight into uveal melanoma genetics, we performed SNP array analysis, whole genome sequencing, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 12 frozen primary uveal melanoma samples. Despite its dismal prognosis, we find that uveal melanoma has a remarkably low mutation burden, and we did not observe a UVR DNA-damage signature. However, we found recurrent mutations in SF3B1 that were associated with differential alternative splicing of both coding and non-coding genes that may play a role in the etiology of this disease.  Go to: Results Our discovery cohort comprised 12 primary uveal melanoma T3-T4 tumors that represented different histological types (1 epithelioid cell, 3 spindle cell and 8 mixed cases) and were treated by primary enucleation (Supplementary Table 1). One case was metastatic at diagnosis and 6 patients subsequently developed metastases. SNP array analysis was performed using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 SNP arrays and whole genome sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The whole genome sequence coverage was >30× (Supplementary Table 2) and the data were aligned to the reference genome and duplicate reads excluded. The whole genomes were compared to their matched normal DNA to identify chromosomal translocations, short insertions/deletions (indels) and somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs).  The SNP arrays revealed low levels of aneuploidy in 11 of the tumors and tetraploidy in tumor #7 (Supplementary Fig. S1; Supplementary Table 3). The diploid tumors presented recurrent chromosome 3 monosomy (9 tumors), losses of 1p (5 tumors), 6q (3 tumors) and 8p (5 tumors), and gains in 6p (4 tumors) and 8q (7 tumors; Supplementary Figs. S1, S2). These aberrations are characteristic of uveal melanoma, but we also observed loss of 16q in three tumors and gain of chromosome 11 in two (Supplementary Figs. S1, S2). The presence of two identical copies of chromosome 3 in tumor #7 suggested that chromosome 3 monosomy preceded acquisition of the tetraploid state. Tumor #7 also displayed trisomy for 1q and monosomy for 8p. Commensurate with the SNP array data, whole genome sequencing also revealed a low level of chromosomal aberrations. We predicted 2-59 inter-chromosomal translocations, 0-7 intra-chromosomal translocations, no inversions, 2-25 large deletions and 0-5 large insertions (Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Table 4). Thus, the frequency of structural variations in uveal melanoma is only ~40% of that reported in cutaneous melanoma and only ~20% of that reported in acral melanoma (Fig 1A)(15, 16). It is also only ~10% of that we recently found in mucosal melanoma (Fig. 1A) (17).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Somatic mutations in uveal melanoma. The whole genome sequencing also revealed a very low number of SNVs. We predicted only 1629-2604 (median 2112) somatic SNVs and 47-178 (median 67) somatic short indels (Table 1). The SNV mutation rate of <1 per Mb (Table 1) is markedly lower than is seen in most other types of cancer (Fig. 1B) and significantly lower than is seen in cutaneous (~30,000 mutations/genome), mucosal (~8000 mutations/genome), or acral (~5,000 mutations/genome) melanoma (15–17).  Table 1 Table 1 Summary of whole genome sequencing mutations for uveal melanoma. UVR-induced DNA damage is characterized by C>T transitions at the 3’ end of pyrimidine dinucleotides (18), a “signature” that accounts for 80-90% of mutations in cutaneous melanoma, and up to 60% of the mutations in acral melanoma (15, 16). Although C to T (G to A) transitions were the commonest mutation in uveal melanoma, they accounted for only ~35% of the lesions (Fig. 1C) and were not enriched at the 3’ position of pyrimidine dimers (Fig. 1D). Thus, UVR induced DNA damage does not appear to play a role in uveal melanomagenesis.  In line with the generally low level of mutations, we observed very few coding region mutations, predicting only 4-19 non-synonymous SNVs per tumor; of which 92% of those tested were validated by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Table 5). We also predicted only 0-2 coding region indels per tumor (Table 1). The only recurrent mutations were A>T, p.209L mutations in GNA11 (7 tumors) and T>A/T>G, p.209L mutations in GNAQ (3 tumors; Supplementary Table 6). We did, however, observe a small number of non-recurrent mutations in individual genes with possible functional significance, including C>T p.P107L in GNA15 that was coincident with A>T, p.209L GNA11 in tumor #10, C>T p.G8R in EIF1AX in tumor #8, and BAP1 mutations in 7 tumors (Supplementary Table 6).  Critically, we also observed non-recurrent mutations in SF3B1 in three tumors (T>G, p.K666T: tumor #6; T>C, p.K700E: tumor #11; C>T, p.R625H: tumor #12) and although there were no chromosome losses or gains in the region encoding SF3B1 (2q33.1) these data suggested a role for SF3B1 in uveal melanoma. We screened SF3B1 in 105 additional consecutive archival primary uveal melanomas and detected 15 additional mutations (8 p.R625H, 4 p.R625C, 1 p.R625P, 1 p.R625L, 1 p.K666T; Supplementary Table 7). Our overall mutation rate of 15% (18/119) is similar to the rate (18.6%) recently reported for SF3B1 mutations in uveal melanoma by whole exome sequencing (9), but note that in addition to the R625 codon mutations reported therein, we also observed K666 and K700 codon mutations (Supplementary Fig. S3). The SF3B1 mutations are inversely associated with chromosome 3 monosomy and notably, they are associated with improved progression-free and cancer survival (Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Fig. S4).  SF3B1 encodes subunit 1 of splicing factor 3b, a component of the spliceosome, so to evaluate the effects of SF3B1 mutations on uveal melanoma transcripts, we hybridized three SF3B1 mutated tumors and three SF3B1 wild-type tumors to Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Arrays (HTA2), which contain both exon and exon-exon junction probes. 325 genes were predicted to be differentially expressed, with 46 genes up-regulated and 279 genes down-regulated in the SF3B1 mutant compared to the SF3B1 wild-type tumors (Supplementary Table 8). Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes did not predict any significant GO term(s), and did not predict KEGG or REACTOME pathway enrichment. However, splicing level analysis predicted 130 genes that contained at least one differentially regulated exon and/or splicing pattern (Supplementary Table 9). Manual inspection of the predicted events by the GenoSplice EASANA® visualization interface revealed eight high-confidence or very high-confidence events, including alternative terminal exons (four events), alternative 3’ acceptor splice sites (two events), alternative cassette exons (one event), and intron retention (one event; Table 2). Critically, six of these events (GUSBP11, UQCC, ANKHD1, ADAM12, CRNDE and ABCC5) were also identified when we analyzed the RNA-seq data from Harbour et al. (Table 2).  Table 2 Table 2 Alternative gene splicing associated with SF3B1 mutations in uveal melanoma. Next, we compared the RNA-seq data from our three SF3B1 mutant to our nine SF3B1 wildtype tumors. For this we used DEXSeq, a Bioconductor package that uses generalized linear models to detect differential exon usage (19), and also MATS, which uses a Bayesian statistical framework to identify alternative splicing (20). 47 genes were predicted to be differentially spliced in these two populations by at least one algorithm (Supplementary Tables 10 & 11). Strikingly, when we compared our analysis of our HTA2 and the Harbour et al. data with our RNA-seq analyses, three alternative splicing events, CRNDE, ABCC5 and UQCC, were identified by all three analyses (Table 2). These data suggest that CRNDE, ABCC5 and UQCC are strong candidates for alternative splicing in SF3B1 mutant tumors, hence we examined the sequencing profiles for three genes in our RNA-seq data. We normalized the number of mapped bases for these genes and compared nucleotide coverage at each base in SF3B1 mutant and wild-type tumors (Fig. 2).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Alternative splicing in SF3B1 mutant uveal melanoma. The profiles for UQCC, revealed clear evidence of alternative terminal exon use in the SF3B1 wild-type and SF3B1 mutant tumors (Fig. 2A). For CRNDE we observed near uniform representation of all bases of exon 4 in the SF3B1 wild-type tumors, but an enrichment of the reads at the 3’ end of this exon in the SF3B1 mutant tumors (Fig. 2B). Finally, in ABCC5, we observed clear evidence of differential splicing of intron 8 (Fig. 2C). Critically, we detected all three of these splicing events when we analysed the RNA-seq data from Harbour et al (Supplementary Figure S5)(9) providing independent confirmation of these alternative splicing events.  Finally, to further validate our findings, we assessed alternative splicing of GUSBP11, UQCC, ANKHD1, GAS8, F8, ADAM12, CRNDE and ABCC5 – the eight genes that provided the strongest evidence of splicing – by qRT-PCR in 74 independent uveal melanomas comprising 58 SF3B1 wild-type and 16 SF3B1 mutant tumors. This analysis confirmed that all eight genes were alternatively spliced in SF3B1 mutant compared to SF3B1 wild-type tumors (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. S6).  Go to: Discussion We describe here the first whole genome sequencing of uveal melanoma, and our data reveal that this is a comparatively simple genetic disease characterized by recurrent chromosomal gains and losses and a relatively low number of SNVs and structural variants. The tumor genomes display a homogenous SNV burden, both in terms of number (1629-2604) and mutation class, and notably, they do not display a canonical UVR-induced DNA damage signature at pyrimidine dinucleotides. The absence of this signature negates an obvious influence of UVR in the etiology of this disease.  We confirm that GNAQ and GNA11 are the most commonly mutated driver oncogenes and that BAP1 is the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor. In addition, we confirm SF3B1 as recurrently mutated in 15% of cases, with a mutation hotspot at codon R625. SF3B1 mutations have been reported in hematological, breast and pancreatic cancers (10–13). Intriguingly, in those cancers codon K700 mutations predominate whereas in uveal melanoma R625 codon mutations predominate. This suggests that either the gene mutations have distinct etiology, so different hotspots are targeted in each disease, or that the diverse biology of the diseases favors selection of discrete mutations. Notably, in common with previous studies (8, 9), we confirm that in uveal melanoma SF3B1 mutations are associated with better prognosis. Thus, in uveal melanoma and myelodysplastic syndrome SF3B1 mutations are associated with improved outcome, whereas in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), SF3B1 mutations are associated with poorer prognosis (21).  SF3B1 encodes subunit 1 of splicing factor 3b, a component of the spliceosome, a large intracellular machine that processes precursor mRNA into mature transcripts. Specifically, splicing factor 3b anchors precursor mRNA onto the splicosome to define the splicing site. Previous studies show that spliceosomal component mutations can alter splicing within a gene, can cause intron retention or can cause aberrant alternative splicing, affecting protein isoform balance and thereby cell proliferation and differentiation (22, 23). In CLL, SF3B1 mutations are associated with alternative splicing at the 3’ ends of genes to generate truncated variants of the vitamin C transporter SLC23A2, the T-cell regulator TC1RG1, and the forkhead transcription factor FOXP1. We show that in uveal melanoma SF3B1 mutations are also associated with alternative splicing (Fig. 2D). We show that in common with CLL, SF3B1 mutations in uveal melanoma are associated with alternative splicing of the 3’ end of transcripts, for example in UQCC, which encodes the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex chaperone, a protein implicated in bone development and stature. We also see differential splicing of ABCC5, a multidrug resistance-associated protein that is implicated in breast cancer metastasis (24) and colorectal cancer (25). Interestingly, in uveal melanoma, we observe evidence of intron retention in ABCC5 in the SF3B1 wild type samples compared to the mutant samples, suggesting that this gene is more efficiently spliced in the SF3B1 mutant than wild-type tumors.  More intriguing, we show that SF3B1 mutations are associated with cryptic alternative splicing of exon 4 of CRNDE. This long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) exists in several alternatively spliced forms and is upregulated in both solid tumors and leukemias (26, 27). CRNDE in general, and exon 4 in particular is alternatively spliced in colorectal cancer and the alternative forms are thought to regulate gene expression by regulating chromatin-modifying enzymes (27, 28). We show that in uveal melanoma, mutations in SF3B1 are associated with cryptic alternative splicing within exon 4 of CRNDE, and considering the comparatively simple genetics of uveal melanoma, it will be important to determine how alternative splicing of this non-coding gene affects cellular function.  In conclusion, we show that despite its appalling prognosis, uveal melanoma is a relatively simple genetic disease characterized by recurrent chromosomal losses and gains, and a low mutational burden. We confirm that GNAQ/GNA11 are the most commonly mutated oncogenes and BAP1 the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor. We identify SF3B1 mutations in ~15% of cases and show these are associated with better prognosis, which will guide clinical management of this disease. Intriguingly, we show that SF3B1 mutations are associated with diverse alternative splicing events, including alternative terminal exon usage, intron retention and cryptic splicing within exons of both protein coding and non-coding genes. Future studies will focus on how these events affect uveal melanoma biology.  Go to: Methods Patient Cohorts  Discovery set Twelve patients with uveal melanoma were included in the WGS study (Supplementary table 1) from whom tumour and matched blood samples were obtained. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Institut Curie and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.  Validation set Consecutive patients diagnosed at the Institut Curie between January 2006 and December 2008 who underwent primary enucleation and with sufficient material at the Biobank were included in the validation series with exclusion of patients with metastasis at diagnosis. Patient characteristics are reported in Supplementary table 6. The follow-up for this analysis ended on December 2012, with a median time of 38 months. During this period, 57 patients (53%) developed metastatic disease and 50 patients (47%) died. Metastatic melanoma was the cause of the death in 43 patients (40%). DNA was extracted from frozen materials or FFPE sections. SF3B1, GNAQ, GNA11 and BAP1 were sequenced by Sanger methods. Oligonucleotide primer sequences are available upon request.  DNA and RNA extraction and sequence analysis  Tumor DNA and RNA were provided by the Biological Resource Center of the Institut Curie. The DNA was extracted from frozen tumor or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples using a standard phenol/chloroform procedure. The total RNA was isolated from frozen tumor samples using TRIzol reagent and cDNA synthesis was performed with MuLV Reverse Transcriptase in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France), with quality assessments performed on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. For Sanger sequencing, gDNA was amplified by PCR and the products were sequenced using dye-terminator chemistry as previously described (16). Primer sequences are available upon request. Sequences were visualized using Sequencher software.  Whole genome sequencing and analysis  Extracted DNA samples were sequenced on three lanes of Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencers to produce paired-end reads of 100bp. FASTQ files from each lane were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh37). Data for each sample were merged and duplicate reads were marked using Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net/). Somatic variants were identified by comparing matched tumor and normal genomes (Supplementary Methods).  SNP array analysis  Genome-wide genotyping for tumor and blood DNA samples was conducted on Illumina HumanOmni2.5 SNP arrays. Raw data files were processed using GenomeStudio and somatic alterations were identified (Supplementary Methods).  RNA extraction and Array hybridization  Total RNA was isolated from frozen biopsy using a miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and quality assessment was conducted using RNA 6000 Nano labchip (Bioanalyzer, Agilent) and by a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo). Total RNA RIN values were between 7.7 and 9 (average: 8.65). Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 ST arrays were hybridized according to Affymetrix recommendations using the Ambion WT protocol (Life technologies, France) and Affymetrix labeling and hybridization kits. 100ng of total RNA were processed in parallel with an external MAQC A RNA to control robustness of data. Labeled DNA mean yield was 7.19 µg (min: 6.27µg; max: 7.57µg). Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Transcriptome 2.0 ST microarrays (HTA2) were hybridized with 4.7 µg of labeled DNA. Raw data, transcript data and exon data were controlled with Expression console (Affymetrix) at the Institut Curie microarray core facility. The benefit of this array is to highlight spliced RNA isoforms using both exon and exon-exon junction probes that can measure excluded or included exons/regions.  Microarray data analysis  Affymetrix HTA2 dataset analysis was performed by GenoSplice technology (www.genosplice.com and Supplementary Methods). We performed an unpaired Student’s t-test to compare gene intensities between SF3B1 wild-type and SF3B1 mutated tumors. Genes were considered significantly differentially expressed when fold-change was ≥1.5 and P-value ≤0.05 (unadjusted P-value). Analysis at the splicing level was first performed taking into account only exon probes (‘EXON analysis’; see Supplementary Methods). Results were considered statistically significant for unadjusted P-values ≤ 0.05 and fold-changes ≥ 1.5 for SPLICING PATTERN analysis and unadjusted P-values ≤ 0.05 and fold-changes ≥ 2.0 for EXON analysis. After bioinformatics analysis of microarray data, a manual inspection using the GenoSplice EASANA® interface was conducted to select high-confident events.  RNA-seq analysis  RNA from the 12 tumor samples was sequenced (Supplementary Methods). Reads were aligned using Tophat (29). Differential splicing analysis between the mutant (n=3) and wild-type SF3B1 (n=9) samples was conducted using DEXseq (19) and events with an FDR <0.1 were regarded as significant. Differential splicing analysis was also conducted by MATS (20), using the mapped read bamfiles as input and events with an FDR <0.1 were regarded as significant. The RNA-seq data from the Habour et al. study (9) were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRA062359) and analysed using the same methodology with the exception that read lengths were trimmed to 99bp. One of the samples described as wild-type SF3B1 was predicted to have an SF3B1 R625C mutation (Supplementary Figure S7) and was designated SF3B1 mutant for the differential splicing analysis.  Splice variant analysis in the validation series  The validation set was used to measure the predicted splice variant of 8 genes using specific probes (Supplementary Table 12). 1.3ng of cDNA were analyzed in duplicate to quantify spliced and unspliced forms by real time PCR. 45 cycles of QPCR were conducted on 384 well plates using QuantiTect SYBR Green reagents (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) onto the ABI 9700HT device. To perform the splice variant analysis, 3 steps were achieved per gene of interest. First, CT values were averaged per sample, then a ratio of spliced form was calculated per sample using the formula: 2-(CT form1 mRNA - CT form2 mRNA). Finally, for each splicing event, a Mann-Whitney U test was applied between SF3B1 mutated and wildtype cases.  Statistical methods  Cancer-specific survival (CSS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to death from uveal melanoma or last follow-up. Event-free survival (EFS) was calculated from the surgical resection to development of metastasis or last follow-up. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method and the difference between groups was compared with the log-rank test. χ2 and Fisher's exact tests were used to determine association between variables. P-values less than 0.05 (two-sided) were considered statistically significant.  Data access  Whole genome, RNA-seq and SNP array data have been submitted to the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under study accession number EGAS00001000472. 
131|| Graphical Abstract Image for unlabelled figure Figure options  Introduction RNA splicing, a highly regulated molecular event orchestrated by the spliceosome, involves the removal of intronic sequences from pre-mRNA and the ligation of exons to generate mature mRNA (Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009). This process can result in multiple mRNAs being produced from a single gene providing increased protein diversity in cells. Dysregulation of RNA splicing has been identified as a causative defect in several diseases (Dehm, 2013 ;  Singh and Cooper, 2012). Furthermore, dysregulated alternative splicing has been proposed to play an important role in tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy; however, in many cases, the molecular consequences of dysregulated splicing in cancer have remained largely elusive (Zhang and Manley, 2013). Recently, recurrent heterozygous mutations were identified in components of the spliceosome in various tumor types suggesting that somatic mutations in spliceosome genes play an important role in cancer (Yoshida and Ogawa, 2014). SF3B1 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene with particular enrichment in diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, uveal melanoma (UVM), skin melanoma (SKCM), and breast (BRCA) and pancreatic cancers ( Biankin et al., 2012; Ellis et al., 2012; Harbour et al., 2013; Kong et al., 2014; Landau et al., 2013; Malcovati et al., 2015 ;  Yoshida et al., 2011). Based on the high frequency of SF3B1 mutations and the key role in splicing of this protein, we sought to study the molecular and functional consequences of SF3B1 hotspot mutations on RNA splicing in cell lines and patient samples.  Splicing takes place after the recognition of consensus sequences near the 5′ and 3′ ends of introns, known as 5′ and 3′ splice sites (ss), by the splicing machinery. U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) recognizes the 5′ ss, whereas U2 snRNP is directed to the appropriate 3′ ss by short, conserved pre-mRNA sequences, including a branch point sequence (BPS), the polypyrimidine (Py) tract, and the AG dinucleotide at the intron-exon junction. Prior to U2 snRNP recruitment, SF1 recognizes the BPS, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) large subunit (U2AF2) recognizes the Py tract, and U2AF small subunit (U2AF1) recognizes the AG dinucleotide. Subsequently, the U2 snRNP replaces SF1 in an ATP-dependent process that facilitates protein and RNA rearrangements. In particular, the N terminus of SF3B1, a U2 snRNP component, has been shown to bind with U2AF2, whereas the SF3B1 C terminus along with another U2 snRNP component, p14, interacts with the BPS and nearby pre-mRNA sequences (Gozani et al., 1998). In addition, U2 snRNP and pre-mRNA complex is stabilized by a base-paired duplex between the U2 snRNA and the BPS. The subsequent binding of U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP induces structural rearrangements that lead to activation of two catalytic steps that generate the lariat intermediate and subsequent final exon-exon product (Horowitz, 2012; Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009).  The recurrent hotspot mutations in SF3B1 are found exclusively in the C-terminal HEAT domains (residues 622–781; Figure S1A). Though there has been lack of structural information on how SF3B1 interacts with pre-mRNA, previous cryo-electron microscopy studies suggest that SF3B1 may undergo a conformational change to a more open form that enables mRNA binding and BPS recognition by the U2 snRNP (Golas et al., 2003). Although it was previously reported by several groups that SF3B1 mutant-positive cancers are associated with aberrant splicing (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013), here, we show that SF3B1 hotspot mutations (SF3B1MUT) result in neomorphic activity causing aberrant splicing. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ ss selection through the use of a branch point (BP) different from the BP utilized by SF3B1 wild-type (SF3B1WT) and that SF3B1MUT still requires the canonical Py tract for the formation of the active spliceosome to induce aberrant splicing. We predict that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced mRNAs are subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that multiple aberrant transcripts are degraded, resulting in downregulation of the associated canonical protein in cell line models and patient samples. These insights into the splicing aberrations induced by SF3B1MUT will enable discovery of downstream consequences that contribute to neoplasms and the discovery of targeted therapeutic approaches for SF3B1MUT cancers.  Results SF3B1MUT Tumor-Specific Splicing Defects  To provide a more complete understanding of the splicing aberrations observed in SF3B1MUT cancers, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from different tumor types were analyzed using a bioinformatic pipeline that we developed in order to quantify exon-exon junctions without the need of predetermined alternative splicing models or annotated splice junctions. The analysis pipeline was applied to CLL patient samples (7 SF3B1MUT and 6 SF3B1WT) and a number of samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas: luminal A primary BRCA (7 SF3B1K700E and 14 SF3B1WT), SKCM (3 SF3B1MUT and 12 SF3B1WT), and UVM (18 SF3B1MUT and 18 SF3B1WT) (Table S1). This analysis revealed 895 aberrant splice junctions to be significantly upregulated in SF3B1MUT compared to SF3B1WT of which 534 events (∼60%) were unique as they had not been previously annotated in major transcriptome databases. The majority of aberrant splicing events observed were aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures 1A and S1B; Table S2), consistent with previous observations (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013).  SF3B1MUT Are Associated with Abnormal Splicing(A) Distribution of unique ... Figure 1.

SF3B1 status information can be found in Table S1. (C) Gene expression for each significantly abnormally and common spliced gene across the four different diseases, quantified in unit of TPM (transcripts per million); ∗ indicates the statistically significant diseases. Box plots and whiskers are represented as per the Tukey method. See also Figure S1 and Tables S2 and S3. Figure options Unsupervised clustering was applied to the identified aberrant junctions and it led to clustering of SF3B1MUT samples distinct from the cluster of SF3B1WT samples (Figure 1B), with the exception of two SF3B1MUT samples (TCGA-D8-A1JH and TCGA-ER-A19S) that clustered with the SF3B1WT samples. This was likely driven by low mutant allele fractions (7% and 14%, respectively) when compared with a range of 25%–52% for other samples (Figure 1B; Table S2). Moreover, samples with SF3B1MUT clustered within each tumor type (BRCA, SKCM, UVM, and CLL), each showing a set of unique aberrantly spliced junctions (Figures 1B and S1C). A set of “common” events (i.e., events found in all tumor types) were observed, consistent with a small overlap of splicing abnormalities found in CLL and UVM described in two previous reports (Furney et al., 2013). The pattern of tumor-specific splicing in BRCA and CLL could, at least in part, be explained by the increased expression of the genes that are aberrantly spliced in these tumor types compared to the other diseases (p = 7.5022 × 10−05 and p = 1.0078 × 10−36, respectively); however, the same was not observed for SKCM and UVM (Figure 1C; Table S3). This suggests that additional mechanisms, such as tissue-specific splicing regulation, might contribute to these patterns.  Using the aberrant junctions identified in the previous analysis, we extended the clustering analysis to include 14 MDS RARS samples (12 SF3B1MUT) and an additional 19 samples from TCGA with miscellaneous SF3B1 mutations (Table S1). For the MDS samples, relatively low sequencing depth and inclusion of just two SF3B1WT samples precluded their use for the discovery of MDS-specific aberrant junctions. While all SF3B1MUT MDS patients and three BRCA patients (p.N626D, p.D781E, and p.K666E) clustered with the original SF3B1MUT sample set, 16 SF3B1 mutant patients clustered with SF3B1WT samples (Figure S1D). These patient samples carried mutations in SF3B1 (“Non-hotspot” in Figure S1D and Table S1) that are not co-localized with the hotspot mutations in the HEAT domain. These analyses strongly suggest a convergence of mechanism and downstream splicing effects induced by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1 Mutations Induce Aberrant mRNA Splicing in Human and Mouse Cells  To study SF3B1MUT in vitro, a pancreatic cancer cell line carrying endogenous SF3B1 mutations (Panc05.04: p.Q699H and p.K700E) was utilized. In addition, the p.K700E, p.K666N, or p.H662Q mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E, Nalm-6 SF3B1K666N, Nalm-6 SF3B1H662Q) or a synonymous mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700K, referred as SF3B1WT) was introduced by AAV-mediated homology to the Nalm-6 pre-B cell line to produce isogenic matched cell lines. Unsupervised clustering of these cell lines and a panel of several SF3B1WT pancreatic cancer cell lines using the aberrant splice junctions identified in patient samples resulted in clear segregation of SF3B1MUT cell lines from SF3B1WT cells (Figure 2A). A similar increase in aberrant splice junctions observed in RNA-seq data analysis was confirmed in Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells using a Nanostring assay developed to quantify aberrant splice junctions (Figure S2A). Panc05.04 cells carry the hotspot mutation p.K700E and a mutation at position 699 (p.Q699H) that is not observed in patient samples. When the p.Q699H and p.K700E were expressed alone or in combination in 293FT cells, only cells expressing p.K700E and p.Q699H/p.K700E induced aberrant splicing indicating that p.Q699H does not appear to affect this aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures S2B and S2C). These data confirm that Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1MUT cell lines are representative models to study the splicing functional activity of SF3B1MUT in vitro.  Aberrant Splice Variants Are Associated with SF3B1MUT in Cell Lines(A) Heatmap ... Figure 2.

Data are represented as mean of three biological replicates. Data are presented in box plots as boxes in the first and third quartiles, midline as the median, and whiskers extending to the range excluding outliers. See also Figure S2. Figure options To confirm that additional cancer-associated SF3B1 hotspot mutations induced aberrant splicing, we expressed various mxSF3B1MUT, mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R in 293FT cells (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for a description of mxSF3B1; Figure S2D) and analyzed splicing aberrations by Nanostring. The p.K700R mutation served as a negative control as it doesn’t introduce a major change in charge or size of the amino acid and is not disease associated. All SF3B1MUT tested demonstrated the same usage of aberrant splice sites observed in endogenous and engineered cell lines; however, the SF3B1K700R or SF3B1WT did not show these splicing changes (Figure 2B). Moreover, the expression of any of the SF3B1 constructs did not change the overall expression (sum of aberrant and canonical) of affected genes (Figure 2B). To further confirm the correlation between expression of SF3B1 p.K700E mutation and aberrant splicing, tetracycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to selectively knockdown (KD) the SF3B1MUT or SF3B1WT allele in Panc05.04 and Panc10.05 (SF3B1MUT and SF3B1WT cells). After confirmation of KD efficiency (Figures S2E–S2H), RNA isolated from treated cells was analyzed by Nanostring. Depletion of the SF3B1MUT allele in Panc05.04 resulted in downregulation of aberrant splice isoforms, whereas an accumulation of aberrant splice isoforms was observed with selective SF3B1WT allele depletion (Figures 2C and 2D), indicating that SF3B1MUT was responsible for the appearance of aberrant splicing. These results were also supported by the expression of a pan shRNA or depletion of SF3B1WT in the Panc10.05 where no effect on aberrant splicing was observed (Figures 2C and 2D). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT acquires a neomorphic function and may also lose wild-type splicing activity. This observation was also supported by the recent paper by Zhou et al. proposing that in a different SF3B1 mutant cell line (ESS1) wild-type SF3B1 was required for survival (Zhou et al., 2015).  SF3B1MUT Recognizes a Cryptic 3′ AG with a Short and Weak Py Tract  The most common splicing abnormality observed in SF3B1MUT cells was the usage of an aberrant 3′ ss. To understand the sequence features and the mechanism by which mutant SF3B1 would induce aberrant splicing, computational analysis of SF3B1MUT patient data and minigene assay validation methods were utilized. First, an enrichment of the cryptic AGs was determined to be located between −15 and −24 nt upstream of the canonical 3′ ss in SF3B1MUT patient samples (Figure 3A). In contrast, the first AG (but not GAG) upstream of a canonical AG in RefSeq showed a much lower density in this region and a wider distribution. Interestingly, the motif sequences associated with the cryptic and canonical AGs showed several different features. Upstream of the canonical AGs, a clear enrichment of pyrimidines was observed in agreement with the presence of a Py tract, whereas the cryptic AGs were associated with a short and weak Py tract and an enrichment of adenines (A) that are possibly important for BPS selection. In contrast, no clear features were associated with the first upstream AGs in RefSeq (Figures 3B and S3). Interestingly, similar features, such as the position of cryptic AG between −15 and −24, the presence of a short and weak Py tract, and an enrichment of As were observed in aberrant 3′ spliced junctions detected in NIH 3T3 mouse cells overexpressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures S4A–S4C). While similar features associated with aberrant splice junction usage were observed in mxSF3B1K700E mouse cells, the overlap of affected junctions observed in human cells was low due to low sequence similarity of introns between species (Figure S4D; Table S4). An exception was observed for the UXS1 gene for which the junction between exon 2 and exon 3 is conserved among different species ( Figure S4E). These data strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant splicing in the presence of competing 3′ ss via a sequence-dependent feature located within the intron and preferentially recognizes cryptic splice sites with weaker Py tract in close proximity to an enrichment of As.

Shown here is a representative ethidium-bromide-stained 2.5% agarose gel of the indicated RT-PCR reactions of mRNA isolated from transfected cells. See also Figures S4 and S5 and Table S4. Figure options To confirm the importance of these specific sequence features, we selected the exon 9/exon 10 junction in ZDHHC16 to develop a minigene as it was observed to be aberrantly spliced among all the SF3B1 hotspot mutant samples analyzed. In addition, several alterations in the cryptic 3′ ss, the length/strength of the Py tracts, and the potential BPS were tested ( Figure S5A). Splicing was assessed by RT-PCR using cDNA prepared from 293FT cells co-transfected with ZDHHC16 minigene and mxSF3B1 plasmid. As expected, when the ZDHHC16 exon 9, intron 9 and exon 10 (E9-I9-E10) minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, only canonical splicing was observed, whereas in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E and all the other hotspot mutations, both canonical and aberrant splicing was detected (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 4 and 5; Figure S5B). Interestingly, once the cryptic AG was removed (E9-I9NoAG-E10), aberrant splicing was not observed even in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that the cryptic AG is necessary for aberrant splicing. To understand whether exonic sequences play a role in aberrant splicing, we looked at the preceding junction in ZDHHC16 (E8-I8-E9). As expected, no aberrant splicing was observed when this minigene was co-transfected with any of the mxSF3B1 constructs (Figure 3D, lanes 10 and 11). Canonical and aberrant splicing was detected when intron 8 between exon 8 and 9 was replaced with intron 9 (E8-I9-E9) in the ZDHHC16 minigene and co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, but not when co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R (Figure 3D, lanes 12 and 13). These results agree with the computational analysis suggesting that the cryptic AG is necessary and the intronic features are sufficient to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  Identification of the 3′ ss occurs during early assembly of the spliceosome, in particular when the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex recognizes the Py tract and AG, and then again when the AG is recognized during the second step of splicing (Horowitz, 2012). To understand if the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is sufficient to recruit the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex, the length/strength of the canonical Py tract was reduced from 19 nt to 10, 6, and 2 nt (PyT 10n, PyT 6n, and PyT 2n, respectively) or the weak and short cryptic Py tract was replaced with a strong Py tract (SELEX) (Figure S5A) (Lim et al., 2011). When the minigene PyT 2n (or PyT 10n and PyT 6n, in Figure S5C) was co-transfected with the mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, the splicing event occurred with selection of a new cryptic 3′ ss within exon 10 positioned 54 nt downstream of the canonical 3′ ss (sequencing data not shown), suggesting that the PyT 2n was not recognized by U2AF complex (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15; Figure S5C). This is in agreement with previous reports suggesting that Py tract length and strength are necessary for the recruitment of U2AF2/U2AF1 to guide splicing to occur at that position (Coolidge et al., 1997). Surprisingly, when the same minigenes were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, similar results were observed and splicing occurred within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15), suggesting that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is not sufficient to recruit the U2AF complex and that the cryptic AG requires the downstream canonical Py tract to induce aberrant splicing. The nucleotide base upstream of the AG dinucleotide has been reported to be critical for U2AF1 interaction in early recognition of 3′ ss and is usually a T/C in consensus sequences (Ilagan et al., 2015). Hence, introduction of a G upstream of the canonical or cryptic AG (−3 T > G or −24 C > G) would potentially abolish their use as a 3′ ss, respectively. When −3 T > G minigene was co-transfected with either mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E constructs, splicing was observed within exon 10, similar to PyT 2n, suggesting again that the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex needs to be recruited at the canonical AG during first step of splicing to allow usage of the cryptic AG by SF3B1MUT (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 16 and 17). Interestingly, when −24 C > G minigene was used, only canonical splicing was observed, even after mxSF3B1K700E expression (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 8 and 9). These data suggest that the −3 position relative to cryptic AG is also important when the cryptic 3′ ss is recognized during the second transesterification reaction of splicing. Moreover, when the short and weak cryptic Py tract was replaced with a SELEX Py tract, the cryptic AG was used as the preferred 3′ ss by cells expressing both mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 18 and 19). Taken together, these data support the notion that the sequence features required by SF3B1MUT-containing U2 snRNP complex are located within the intron and that the cryptic AG and the downstream canonical Py tract are required to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1MUT Utilizes a Different BPS  The computational analysis of motifs near the 3′ ss showed an enrichment of As upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse mutant SF3B1 cells, suggesting the importance of this sequence for the SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 complex. DeBoever and colleagues suggested that these were the BPSs for the mutant and wild-type SF3B1 complexes using a BPS prediction algorithm (DeBoever et al., 2015). Instead, we used the recently mapped BPS data using K562 SF3B1WT cells and overlaid these data with introns in which the aberrant splice junctions were observed in SF3B1MUT cells (Mercer et al., 2015). A total of 151 BPs were mapped among 93 introns; 60 introns have only one identified BP, and another 33 introns contain multiple reported BPs. The distribution of these BPs with respect to the cryptic AG indicated that the majority of BPs overlapped with the A of the cryptic AG or were in close proximity (between 1, cryptic A and −5), but did not coincide with the enrichment of As observed in the motif analysis (Figure 4A). The enrichment of As was observed between −8 and −18 nt upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse cells expressing mutant SF3B1 (Figures 4B and S4C). This suggests that these As could play an important role for SF3B1MUT function. To test this hypothesis, the 3 As located between −33 and −35 were mutated to Gs in the ZDHHC16 minigene (−33 to −35 AAA > GGG; Figure 4C and S5A). When this minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT and mxSF3B1K700R, canonical splicing was observed, suggesting that these As are not part of the BPS for wild-type U2 complex (Figure 4D, lanes 11 and 12). Instead, when the cells were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, canonical splicing was observed without any aberrant splicing, indicating that the three As are probably part of the BPS used by the U2 mutant complex (Figure 4D, lane 12). To identify the BPS used by the U2 wild-type complex, the A at position −26 and −30 alone or together were mutated to G (−26 A > G, −30 A > G and −26, −30 AA > GG; Figure 4C). When the A at position −26 alone or both −26 and −30 were mutated to G and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, splicing was observed within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10), suggesting that this is likely the BPS for SF3B1WT, but not for SF3B1K700E, as canonical and aberrant splicing was observed in these conditions (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10). Interestingly, when the minigene with the A at position −30 alone was mutated to G (Figure 4C and S5A) and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R splicing was observed mostly within exon 10 and when co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, only aberrant splicing was observed (Figure 4D, lanes 7 and 8). As expected, when all the As were mutated to Gs (all A > G, Figures 4C and S5A), each mxSF3B1 construct spliced within exon 10 (Figure 4D, lanes 13 and 14). Additionally, this outcome was confirmed by mapping the two different BPs using nested PCR analysis and sequencing of endogenous ZDHHC16 intron 9 lariat in K562 isogenic cells ( Figure 4E). Unlike in SF3B1WT cells, we observed at least two major templates with different sequences in the SF3B1K700E cells due to a mixed population of SF3B1WT and SF3B1MUT proteins. Through analysis and matching of expected transcript sequences using Mutation Surveyor, we found that −34 A and −30 A were the BPs used for SF3B1K700E and SF3B1WT, respectively. To extend our observation, we also mapped BPs in four additional genes that are aberrantly spliced in presence of SF3B1K700E: TMEM14C (intron 1), SEPT6 (intron 9), DLST (intron 5), and DIP2A (intron 23) ( Table S5). These results prove that the SF3B1 wild-type and mutant-containing U2 complexes are able to use two different BPs.  SF3B1MUT Uses a Different BPS than SF3B1WT(A) Relative positions of mapped BP ...

Figure options Aberrant Transcripts Generated by SF3B1MUT Are Subjected to NMD  Erroneous or aberrant mRNAs that contain a premature termination codon are subjected to NMD to prevent potential deleterious effects of their translation to proteins (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Computational analysis revealed that the majority of cryptic AGs were located upstream of canonical 3′ ss at nucleotide distances that were not multiples of 3 (Figure 5A). This result suggested that the aberrant transcripts would have a higher probability to be out of frame and therefore degraded by NMD. To confirm that predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts were degraded by the NMD pathway, RNA-seq was performed on Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells treated with cycloheximide, a translation inhibitor known to inhibit NMD (Singh et al., 2012). Bioinformatic prediction analysis revealed that 44% of all aberrant mRNAs identified in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cell lines would result in an NMD-sensitive transcript (Rivas et al., 2015) (Figure 5B; Tables S6 and S7). RNA-seq analysis from Nalm-6 isogenic cells demonstrated that NMD-sensitive genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E than Nalm-6 SF3B1WT (p = 1.06 × 10−12), whereas predicted NMD-insensitive genes were expressed at similar levels (Figure 5C). RNA-seq analysis identified 41 predicted NMD-sensitive genes to be both downregulated in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E and to have increased abundance following cycloheximide treatment (Figure 5D; Table S6), suggesting that these aberrant transcripts were degraded by the NMD. In addition, to evaluate if this would result in downregulation of the associated canonical protein, stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) with subsequent mass spectrometry was used to quantify protein levels in Nalm-6 isogenic lines (Oda et al., 1999)· Eleven predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts for which peptides could be detected in Nalm-6 SF3B1WT were selected for evaluation, and ten were found to have decreased peptide counts by at least 2- to 8-fold (e.g., ABCB7, AKAP8L; Figure 6A). Decreased expression of canonical proteins was confirmed by western blot analysis using available antibodies, such as MZB1, PHGDH, and SEPT6 (Figure 6B). Among the downregulated proteins in the SILAC experiment were two proteins of particular interest: MZB1 and ABCB7. MZB1 is a B cell-specific and ER-localized protein implicated in antibody secretion and integrin-mediated cell adhesion (van Anken et al., 2009). As shown in Figure 6C, MZB1 was aberrantly spliced in SF3B1K700E cells and the canonical isoform was clearly downregulated at transcript and protein level (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6D). As shown in Figure 6E, clear downregulation of canonical MZB1 protein level was also observed in four out of five CLL patients with SF3B1MUT, but not in SF3B1WT samples. The result for patient 8 could be explained by the low allele fraction for Y623C (10%), and this was associated with undetectable aberrant splicing for ZDHHC16 and no change in canonical MZB1 when compared with one of the SF3B1WT patients (Figure S6). ABCB7 is a mediator of iron accumulation and erythroid growth and has been reported to be downregulated specifically in an MDS subtype characterized by refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (Boultwood et al., 2008). Interestingly, SF3B1 mutations have been found at a frequency of 80%–90% in RARS, but not in other MDS subtypes (Papaemmanuil et al., 2011). In addition, a partial loss-of-function mutation in ABCB7 has been identified in X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia demonstrating an iron-overload phenotype in cells with defective ABCB7 (Allikmets et al., 1999). We identified that ABCB7 is aberrantly spliced in SF3B1 mutant cells (Figure 6F) and demonstrated that the aberrant transcript is subject to NMD, causing downregulation of the canonical transcript and protein (Figures 6A and 6D). Therefore, aberrant splicing and subsequent NMD of ABCB7 likely explains the association between ABCB7 downregulation observed in RARS and the presence of SF3B1 mutants. Taken together, these data suggest that SF3B1MUT might contribute to the phenotypes observed in diseases by inducing the generation of NMD-sensitive transcripts through aberrant splicing and to a subsequent reduction in the levels of the corresponding proteins.  44% of All Aberrantly Spliced Genes Are Putative Targets of NMD(A) Frequency of ...

See also Figure S6. Figure options Discussion In the current study, we describe the mechanism by which SF3B1 hotspot mutations induce aberrant splicing and the fate of resulting NMD-sensitive aberrant mRNAs in several cancer types. These mutations are associated with the expression of hundreds of aberrantly spliced junctions, mostly by utilizing a cryptic AG. While some aberrant junctions are common across different cancer types, others are tumor specific, which in some cases is a consequence of tissue-specific gene expression; however, additional factors likely contribute to these differences. Interestingly, aberrant splicing was observed only in patients carrying hotspot mutations located in the C-terminal HEAT domains, but not in samples from “non-hotspot” patients, as they clustered with the SF3B1WT patients in aberrant junction usage comparisons. The majority of these non-hotspot mutations are located away from the HEAT repeat domains, which suggests that they may have different effects on cancer cells or simply are passenger mutations, and are not the focus of the present study. We calculated an electrostatic potential map based on a homology model of SF3B1WT with importin-β and observed that all hotspot mutations are co-localized in a limited, positively charged region even though they are distributed across five different HEAT domains (Figure 7A). Furthermore, while there are various amino acid substitutions at the hotspots that result in change of size and/or polarity of side chains, our data suggest the functional consequences on splicing for these changes are similar. We show that hotspot SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ splicing in junctions associated with specific sequence features: an enrichment of As followed by a short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG located −15 to −24 nt from the canonical 3′ ss.

The position of the hotspot mutations located in the five HEAT repeat domains (highlighted in yellow) is represented in the inset. (B and C) Schematic representation of splicing in SF3B1WT (B) and SF3B1MUT (C) cells and molecular consequences of transcripts is also shown. Figure options Based on computational analysis, it was recently suggested that SF3B1 mutations cause a change in the size of the sterically protected region downstream of the BP without any altered BP recognition allowing the utilization of the cryptic AG (DeBoever et al., 2015). It was also suggested that SF3B1 mutations could alter interactions with U2AF2, affecting the ability to recognize the canonical 3′ ss and leading to cryptic 3′ ss selection. In contrast, we provide experimental evidence that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is insufficient for the recruitment of the U2AF complex and that the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss, and thereby interaction with U2AF2 is required to observe aberrant splicing as well. In addition, we have demonstrated that the SF3B1MUT U2 complex utilizes a BP that is different from the one used by the wild-type U2 complex (proposed model, Figures 7B and 7C). Based on these data and the restricted localization of the hotspot mutations, we hypothesize that SF3B1MUT interacts differently with the pre-mRNA or splicing factors that are important for the recognition of AG during the second step of splicing. The close proximity of the two mapped BPs for ZDHHC16 (−30A for SF3B1WT and −34A for SF3B1MUT) reported here (Figure 4E) and the published data on the crosslinking of SF3B1 to bases flanking the BPS (Gozani et al., 1998) would suggest a competition between the SF3B1WT- and SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 snRNP complexes to select the canonical or cryptic AG for splicing, respectively. The mechanism by which SF3B1MUT favors selection of a different BP can only be speculated at this point. Based on our data and a previous study investigating spliceostatin A’s mechanism of action (Corrionero et al., 2011), there are at least two hypotheses: the selection of the new BP is guided by SF3B1MUT through enhanced direct interactions with specific nucleotides flanking the new BPS compensating for reduced base pairing with U2 snRNA or by the base pairing of U2 snRNA with the new/suboptimal BPS compensating for impaired interactions of SF3B1MUT across the canonical BPS.  Although SF3B1MUT does not seem to affect the pre-assembly of U2 snRNP (preliminary data not shown), it is possible that the interactions with splicing factors involved in selection of an alternative AG in the second step of splicing are impaired. Previously, it has been reported that the second step splicing factor, Slu7, is required for correct 3′ ss selection (Chua and Reed, 1999a ;  Chua and Reed, 1999b). Similar to U2AF1, Slu7 harbors a Zn knuckle domain, and it is conceivable that it directly interacts with AG during the second step of splicing. As observed in the case of SF3B1MUT, depletion of Slu7 results in selection of a cryptic AG closer to the BPS. This suggests that SF3B1 hotspot mutations may impair the recruitment of Slu7 to the catalytic core. Additionally, it has been reported that splicing factor SPF45 (hSPF45 is RBM17) is involved in recognition and activation of an alternative AG upstream of the canonical 3′ ss. It has been suggested that SPF45 directly or indirectly binds to the upstream alternative AG with the help of SF3B1 and promotes its utilization during the second catalytic step (Corsini et al., 2007 ;  Lallena et al., 2002). Interestingly, as observed in the present study for SF3B1MUT, SPF45 also depends on the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss to splice at the alternative AG. Since SF3B1MUT binds at a different BPS, it can be speculated that the recruited SPF45 can access the cryptic AG which is otherwise prevented due to the steric hindrance by SF3B1WT. Taken together, the SF3B1 hotspot mutations could be facilitating SPF45 activity and/or abrogating Slu7 activity for selection of the aberrant AG, thereby providing an unanticipated mechanism for regulation of splice site utilization.  Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is a known cellular mechanism that adds complexity and flexibility in gene expression to induce stage-specific patterns not only by inducing expression of a particular isoform but also by engaging NMD to downregulate gene expression (Ge and Porse, 2014 ;  Kalyna et al., 2012). Here, we predicted that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced transcripts in SF3B1MUT cells are NMD sensitive, and we have demonstrated that the associated canonical isoforms are downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels. The downregulation of a large number of genes induced by this “spliceosome sickness” could be the cause of impaired cell functions that contribute to cancer phenotypes and potentially create dependency on essential genes or pathways for survival. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency is a proposed mechanism for disease pathogenesis in MDS, where chromosome 5q is deleted and decreased expression of genes located on the remaining chromosome is observed (e.g., RPS14 and CSKN1A1; Ebert et al., 2008 ;  Schneider et al., 2014). It is plausible that SF3B1 mutations contribute to MDS in a similar fashion by downregulating expression of certain genes resulting in a non-classical path to haploinsufficiency. In addition to the downregulation of canonical proteins, it is also possible that NMD-insensitive aberrant transcripts are translated into aberrant proteins that have altered function. Proteomic analysis of isogenic SF3B1MUT cells did not reveal the presence of aberrant proteins (data not shown), but this may be due to limitations of assay sensitivity, and additional targeted SILAC or deep RNA sequencing of active ribosome fractions may have the required sensitivity to detect such proteins. Recently, several groups reported the molecular consequences and phenotypic effects of other spliceosome mutations, such as U2AF1 and the exonic splicing enhancer binding serine/arginine-rich protein SRSF2 ( Ilagan et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015 ;  Shirai et al., 2015). Though there are some overlaps in genes differentially spliced in tissues affected by each spliceosome mutation, we see only minimal overlaps in predicted NMD targets (Figure S7). However, mutations in all three splicing factors are observed in MDS and are mutually exclusive, suggesting that some of the downstream effects might be common. Thus, while not explored in this study, it is likely that SF3B1 mutations result in defects in hematopoiesis, as has been observed in animal models of SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations. Additional work is ongoing to define the downstream splicing abnormalities that drive the phenotypic effects of spliceosome mutations. Finally, it is also plausible that mutations in SF3B1 impact other proposed splicing regulators (e.g., chromatin, histone modifications), and these should be the subject of future study ( de Almeida et al., 2011; Kfir et al., 2015 ;  Khan et al., 2013).  In summary, computational and experimental approaches were used to demonstrate that SF3B1MUT utilizes a different BP to induce aberrant splicing across multiple cancer types. These insights describe a neomorphic activity for SF3B1 mutations that causes downregulation of canonical protein expression. Furthermore, these studies provide a foundation for the potential discovery of targeted approaches for the treatment of patients carrying SF3B1 hotspot mutations.  The splicing factor SF3B1 is the most commonly mutated gene in the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), particularly in patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS). We investigated the functional effects of SF3B1 disruption in myeloid cell lines: SF3B1 knockdown resulted in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and impaired erythroid differentiation and deregulation of many genes and pathways, including cell cycle regulation and RNA processing. MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared with wild-type cases include genes that are involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1 and CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7 and SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8 and HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. This is the first study to determine the target genes of SF3B1 mutation in MDS CD34+ cells. Our data indicate that SF3B1 has a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link.  Go to: Introduction The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) malignancies characterized by blood cell dysplasia and peripheral blood cytopenia. Approximately 30–40% of MDS patients will develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML).1  The recent discovery of somatic splicesomal mutations in MDS has revealed a new leukemogenic pathway involving spliceosomal dysfunction.2, 3 Somatic mutations in the splicing factor genes SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2 are frequent in MDS patients.4 Importantly, these genes encode proteins that are all involved in 3′-splice site recognition during pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing. Splicing factor gene mutations occur in over 50% of MDS patients, are highly specific to this disorder, and occur in a mutually exclusive manner.5, 6, 7  SF3B1, encoding a core component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, involved in the recognition of the branchpoint sequence, is the most commonly mutated gene found in MDS (20–28% of all patients).2, 8, 9 We and others have shown that mutations of the splicing factor SF3B1 are found in a high percentage (>70%) of MDS patients whose disease is characterised by the presence of ring sideroblasts, including both refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS).2, 8 The close association between SF3B1 mutation and the presence of ring sideroblasts is consistent with a causal relationship and makes this the first gene to be strongly associated with a specific morphological feature of MDS. Ring sideroblasts are characterised by an excess accumulation of iron in the mitochondria of erythroblasts,10 and SF3B1 mutant RARS cases show altered iron distribution characterised by coarse iron deposits compared with wild-type RARS cases.11 SF3B1 mutations are generally more prevalent in low-risk MDS and have been shown to be independent predictors of favorable clinical outcome in MDS in most studies.8, 11 The clinical consequences of SF3B1 mutation in MDS are clear, but the functional consequences of these mutations in human cells remain poorly understood. Altered RNA splicing has been suggested as the mechanism underlying the observed phenotypic changes concomitant to splicing factor gene mutations, including SF3B1; 3, 12, 13 however, the target genes in the HSC of MDS cases with SF3B1 mutations are yet to be defined.  SF3B1 mutations in MDS are primarily heterozygous point mutations. The presence of hotspots and the absence of nonsense or frameshift mutations in SF3B1 in MDS patients suggest that SF3B1 mutations are likely to be gain/change-of-function (neomorphic) mutations. A heterozygous Sf3b1+/− knockout mouse model has been shown to develop ring sideroblasts, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of SF3B1 may lead to their formation.11 Recent similar studies have not made this observation, however.14, 15 Thus, it is yet to be determined whether SF3B1 mutations found in MDS are loss-of-function mutations or gain/change-of-function mutations. In this study, we thus evaluated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell growth, gene expression and splicing in a range of myeloid cell lines and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the CD34+ cells of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  Go to: Materials and methods Myeloid cell lines culture  K562, HEL, TF1 and SKM1 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. TF1 and SKM1 cultures were supplemented with 2 and 1 ng/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, respectively.  SF3B1 knockdown  Three non-overlapping small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting SF3B1 and two different scramble sequences with guanine–cytosine content similar to the siRNA sequences (Stealth Select RNAi, Invitrogen) were used to knock down SF3B1 in myeloid cell lines. For each transfection, 30 pmol of siRNA and 2 × 106 cells were electroporated in an Amaxa Nucleofector I, using the Amaxa cell optimization kit V (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Evaluation of green fluorescent protein-positive cells obtained using the pmaxGFP fluorescent expression plasmid confirmed >80% of successfully transfected cells after 24 h. Readout data are reported as mean±s.e.m. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.  Cell growth assay  Live and dead cells were assessed by trypan blue viability testing and counted using a hemocytometer.  Cell cycle analysis  Cells were fixed with ice cold methanol, incubated with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNaseA, as previously described.16 Data were acquired on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed using FLOWJO software 7.6.4 (FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA).  Erythroid differentiation  To induce erythroid differentiation, K562, TF1 and HEL cells were cultured with hemin 50 μm for 72 h. Erythroid differentiation was studied by analyzing the expression level of γ-globin (HBG1) using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) as described previously.17 Expression of the erythroid markers CD36, CD71 and CD235a was evaluated by flow cytometry as described previously.16  Quantitative real-time PCR  Total RNA was reverse transcribed using Retroscript kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). The expression levels of SF3B1, ABCB7, FTMT, HBG1, KLF1 and B2M were determined using Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). B2M expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input complementary DNA (cDNA). Triplicate samples were run on a LightCycler 480 Real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK) and expression ratios were calculated using the ddCT method.18  Gene expression profiling  Total RNA (100 ng for each sample) was amplified and labeled with the 3′ IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips, as described previously.19, 20 CEL files were pre-processed using Robust Multi-chip Average and data analysis was performed using GeneSpring 7.3.1 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) 7.5 (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), as previously described.19 Analysis of gene set up- or downregulation was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis,21 as previously described (false discovery rate<0.1).2  Splicing analysis using human genome exon-junction microarray  Total RNA was DNAse treated (Invitrogen), purified (Agencourt RNA Clean XP) and amplified (100 ng) using Ambion WT Expression Kit (Affymetrix). The cDNA was subsequently fragmented and labeled using WT terminal labeling kit (Affymetrix). Samples were hybridized onto Affymetrix Human genome exon-junction arrays, which on average contain 119 unique probes per gene spanning every exon and known exon–exon junction. CEL files were analyzed using GenoSplice technology (www.genosplice.com).22, 23 Data were normalized using quantile normalization. Analysis at the exon level was performed taking into account only exon probes. Analysis at the splicing variant level was performed by taking into account exon–exon junction probes using the FAST DB splicing patterns annotation (release fastdb_2012_2). Unpaired Student's t-test was used to determine exon and splicing pattern variation between cells with SF3B1 knockdown and scramble controls. Genes were considered significantly deregulated when fold change was ⩾1.5 and P-value <0.05. Gene Ontology, KEGG and REACTOME analyses of differentially regulated genes were performed using DAVID.24  Splicing analysis using qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing  Splicing analysis of TP53 was performed using Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted individual bands from PCR-amplified cDNA. Primers and PCR conditions are listed in Supplementary Table S1.  Splicing analysis of cyclins CCNA2 and STK6 was performed using a qRT-PCR on cDNA, using primers specific for splice junctions corresponding to exon inclusion or skipping.25 Primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. TBP expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input cDNA.  RNA sequencing  Bone marrow samples were obtained from MDS patients and healthy controls and CD34+ cells isolated using MACS magnetic cell separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), as described previously.19, 20 RNA extracted from bone marrow CD34+ cells obtained from 12 MDS patients and 5 healthy controls was used for deep RNA-Seq. Eight of the 12 MDS cases (four RARS and four RCMD-RS) had SF3B1 gene mutation, whereas four cases (all RCMD) had no known mutations in splicing factor genes (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 or ZRSR2) (Supplementary Table S3), as determined by targeted next-generation sequencing data from a previous study.7  Total RNA was DNase treated (Invitrogen), purified using XP beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and processed (100 ng) using NEBNext Ultra directional mRNA Library prep (NEB, Hitchin, UK) as per the manufacturer's protocol for Illumina with two alterations: custom indexes were designed in house and an additional purification step was performed using XP beads (Beckman Coulter) rather than size selection. Samples were run on HiSeq2000 Illumina sequencing machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome using TopHat,26 which can handle reads spanning exon–exon boundaries. Data analysis was performed using edgeR27 to evaluate the whole transcript expression (false discovery rate<0.05) and with DEXSeq28 to evaluate differential exon usage (false discovery rate<0.05). At the expression level, only genes with at least 10 reads in four or more samples were included in the analysis; at the exon level, exons with fewer than 10 reads were excluded. Gender was included as an additional factor in the DEXSeq model testing for differential exon usage. Selected differentially expressed exons were validated using qRT-PCR (Supplemetary Figure S1, Supplementary Information). Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) v2.3 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) was used for visualization of the sequence reads. Pathway analysis was performed using IPA and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, as described above. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE63569.  Go to: Results SF3B1 knockdown inhibits cell growth, induces cell cycle arrest and impairs erythroid differentiation  SF3B1 was knocked down using siRNA technology in four myeloid cell lines (TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1) that we found to be wild type for SF3B1 (Supplementary Information), resulting in a significant decrease in expression ranging between 50 and 60% (Figure 1a).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting SF3B1 was compared with the corresponding cell line transfected with the scramble control. (a) SF3B1 mRNA expression measured 3 days after knockdown. (b ... Cell growth was inhibited in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown in comparison with the scramble control (Figure 1b). Cell cycle arrest in different phases was detected in different myeloid cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1c). K562 cells showed a significant G2M cell cycle arrest with a concomitant reduction in the percentage of cells in the G1 and S phase. TF1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase. HEL cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase and a significant increase in the sub-G1 cell population, indicating increased apoptosis. Similarly, SKM1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in S and G2M phase with a concomitant increase in the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 and G1 phase, indicating cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and an increase in apoptosis (Figure 1c).  Three cell lines (TF1, K562 and HEL) with SF3B1 knockdown were cultured with hemin to induce erythroid differentiation. We assessed the expression of the erythroid differentiation markers HBG1 and KLF1 using qRT-PCR. A significant reduction in the expression of HBG1 and KLF1 was observed in TF1 and K562 cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1d). In addition, we observed a reduction in the percentage of CD36+CD71+ and CD71+CD235a+ erythroid populations (significant for the CD36+CD71+ population) in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown compared with the scramble control (Figure 1e), suggesting that normal SF3B1 function is required for erythroid differentiation.17  RARS is characterized by FTMT accumulation and low expression levels of the iron transporter ABCB7.17, 29 We have previously shown that SF3B1 knockdown leads to decreased ABCB7 expression and increased FTMT expression in K562 cells.17 In this study, we have extended these observations to the other three myeloid cell lines investigated (Figure 2a). In addition, restoration of SF3B1 expression to normal levels after 10 days of culture was followed by restoration of ABCB7 expression levels to normal (Supplementary Figure S2).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown on gene expression and splicing. (a) ABCB7 and FTMT expression levels in TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1 cells with SF3B1 knockdown, as measured by qRT-PCR 48 h post transfection. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting ... Taken together, these data show that SF3B1 knockdown results in inhibition of cell growth, induction of cell cycle arrest and impairment of erythroid differentiation in myeloid cell lines.  SF3B1 knockdown alters gene expression  To evaluate the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on global gene expression, gene expression profiling was performed in the four myeloid cell lines. For each cell line, we compared the expression profiles of cells treated with two different siRNAs targeting SF3B1 with those of cells treated with a scramble control, 48 h post transfection.  We identified many genes that were up- or downregulated by >2-fold in each cell line treated with SF3B1 siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B). Four genes were upregulated (TFDP1, LOC100505759, MKRN1 and WRNIP1) and five genes were downregulated (ZC3H7A, CREBZF, SGK494, WSB1 and two probesets for SF3B1) in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  Pathway analysis was performed on the up- and downregulated genes in each cell line with SF3B1 knockdown using IPA. Significant deregulation of pathways related to cell cycle regulation was observed in all cell lines and of mTOR signaling and AMPK signaling pathways in three cell lines (Table 1). We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to identify pathways and processes showing coordinated up- or downregulation. Upregulated gene sets include p53 signaling in K562 and SKM1 cells, and several gene sets associated with regulation of transcription, spliceosome and splicing in K562 cells (Supplementary Table S4). Downregulated gene sets associated with the mitochondrial function were found in K562 and TF1 cells, and with cell cycle regulation in SKM1 and HEL cells (Supplementary Table S4). These data show that SF3B1 knockdown in the cell lines studied results in deregulation of many genes and pathways including cell cycle and RNA processing.  Table 1 Table 1 List of significant deregulated pathways in cell lines obtained using IPA SF3B1 knockdown impact on splicing  The genome-wide effects of SF3B1 knockdown on splicing were investigated in two myeloid cell lines (K562 and TF1) using human genome exon-junction arrays. The splicing profile of cells with SF3B1 knockdown (using two different siRNA per cell line) was compared with that of cells transfected with the scramble control.  We observed 2027 differentially expressed exons from 1419 genes, and 507 significant differentially regulated splicing variants (including exon skipping, intron retention and alternative splice sites) of 384 genes in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of CDC7 and SRSF11 in the data from both the cell lines, and of TP53 in TF1 cells. We found a significant overrepresentation of 3′ acceptor splice sites affected by alternative splicing events compared with 5′ donor splice sites (5:1 ratio, P=0.0027, χ2 test with Yates' correction), consistent with the known role of SF3B1 in the recognition of 3′ splice sites. Gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/), and many themes showed significant enrichment of genes affected at the level of exon usage and splice variants (Table 2). Cell cycle and RNA degradation were found to be consistently deregulated at both levels (Table 2). We investigated TP53 differential exon usage by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted bands. We observed exon skipping that was present in the SF3B1 knockdown cells only (Figure 2b).  Table 2 Table 2 Pathway analysis using human genome exon-junction array data at two different levels: differential exon usage and different splicing variant We also investigated whether two cell cycle genes (CCNA2 and STK6) previously shown to be aberrantly spliced in HeLa cells with SF3B1 knockdown,25 were also aberrantly spliced in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown in our study. Consistent with the finding in HeLa cells, we observed aberrant splicing of these genes using a qRT-PCR strategy as described previously (Figure 2c and d).25  RNA-Seq in HSPC from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations  To gain insight into the spectrum of genes that are deregulated or aberrantly spliced in association with SF3B1 mutation in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) of MDS patients, we used deep RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation (SF3B1 mutants), four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation (wild type) and five healthy controls (control) (Supplementary Table S3). Using IGV, we evaluated the expression of the SF3B1 alleles in SF3B1 mutant cases and observed a range of 45–52% of mutant allele frequency, indicating that both wild-type and mutant alleles were equally expressed (Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Figure S4).  We used edgeR to perform differential gene expression analysis of SF3B1 mutants versus wild type and control. At the whole transcript level, we observed a total of 526 genes (253 upregulated and 273 downregulated) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutants in comparison with wild type (Supplementary Table S5). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutants with control, we found 1823 significantly differentially expressed genes (646 upregulated and 1177 downregulated) (Supplementary Table S6). Genes linked to the pathogenesis of RARS and RCMD-RS, such as ALAS2 and ABCB7, were deregulated (ALAS2 upregulated and ABCB7 downregulated) in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. We also observed upregulation of the mitochondrial genes SLC25A37 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and GLRX5 in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control.  We performed an analysis using 121 genes either known to be expressed in erythroid cells30 or described as erythroid transcription factors in the literature. We found 42 differentially expressed genes (37 upregulated and 5 downregulated) when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control. These included heme biosynthetic enzymes (for example, ALAS2, ALAD, FECH and UROD), globin genes (for example, HBQ1, HBA2, HBB and HBA1) and transcription factors (for example, GATA1, GATA2 and KLF1). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we found a total of 32 differentially expressed genes (31 upregulated and 1 downregulated) of which 28 were overlapping with the differentially expressed genes found when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control.  We then performed pathway analysis on the significantly differentially expressed genes using IPA. Many pathways, including heme biosynthesis, mitotic roles of polo-like kinase and TNFR2 signaling, were significantly deregulated in the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type (Table 3). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with control, significantly deregulated pathways included apoptosis signaling, p53 signaling, cell cycle regulation and heme degradation (Supplementary Table S7). We next performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysisand many gene sets showing significant enrichment were identified in SF3B1 mutant versus wild type and control. Upregulated gene sets included several that were related to mitochondrial function, cell cycle checkpoints and mRNA splicing. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with control cases, downregulated gene sets included several that were related to cell differentiation and apoptosis (Supplementary Table S8). Many of these deregulated pathways and gene sets are relevant to the known pathophysiology of MDS and in particular of RARS and RCMD-RS.  Table 3 Table 3 Pathway analysis (IPA) of the significant differentially expressed genes between SF3B1 mutant and wild type obtained using edgeR DEXSeq was used to perform differential exon usage analysis of the RNAseq data to evaluate aberrantly spliced genes. At the exon level, we observed a total of 3506 exons (corresponding to 1924 genes) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (Table 4, Figure 3, Supplementary Table S9). Differential exon usage was observed in at least one exon of genes known to be involved in MDS pathophysiology (TP53 and EZH1), erythroid genes (ALAD, UROD and EPB42) and genes associated with cell cycle (AURKB and CRNDE) and RNA processing (RBM5, RBM25, PRPF40A and HNRNPD). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type cases, we found 3097 significantly differentially expressed exons (corresponding to 2022 genes) (Table 5, Figure 4, Supplementary Table S10). We found differential exon usage in at least one exon of genes involved in MDS pathophysiology (CBL, ASXL1 and DNMT3A), mitochondrial function (ALAS2, NDUFAF6), erythroid differentiation (NFE2L2, PPOX and HMBS) and mRNA processing (HNRNPD, U2AF2 and PRPF8). Interestingly, UQCC1, a gene involved in mitochondrial biogenesis31 and showing abnormal splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases in uveal melanoma,32 showed differential exon usage and upregulation in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with wild type and control in our study.

Table 4 Table 4 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and control, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq Table 5 Table 5 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and wild type, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq To identify pathways affected by differential exon usage, we performed pathway analysis on the genes showing significantly differentially expressed exons using IPA. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, we observed many pathways to be affected, including cell cycle, heme biosynthesis, DNA damage response, mitochondrial and haematopoietic progenitor cells pathway (Supplementary Table S11 and S12). Using DAVID functional annotation tool, we observed significant enrichment of biological themes including alternative splicing, RNA binding, mitochondrion, spliceosome and cell cycle.  Recently, a role for SF3B1 in the maintenance of genomic stability has also been reported where it functions in a DNA damage-induced mRNA splicing complex with BRCA1 and BCLAF1.33 Given that deregulation of the DNA damage response pathway was highlighted by the IPA pathway analysis, we performed an analysis using genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex. Several genes regulated by this complex showed differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (including NUMA1, RB1, CHUK and ABL1) and compared with wild type (NUMA1, PIAS1, SMAD4, BIRC2 and PTK2) (Supplementary Table S13). The overrepresentation of genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex was significant in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (P<0.001) and compared with wild type (P=0.0498, hypergeometric test). We also found many genes to be affected at the transcript level, including BIRC3, BCL2A1, GYPB, HBB and HBBP1 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control (Supplementary Table S13).  Go to: Discussion The identification of frequent somatic mutations of SF3B1 in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts suggests a direct correlation between the presence of mutations and this particular phenotype.2, 11, 13 However, the mechanism by which SF3B1 mutation leads to MDS with ring sideroblasts remains to be elucidated.  To illuminate the role of SF3B1 mutation in MDS pathophysiology, we have determined the effects of SF3B1 disruption on cell growth and gene expression in human hematological cells. First, we investigated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell function and gene expression in myeloid cell lines. Second, we used RNA-Seq to study the global gene expression changes and splicing abnormalities associated with the presence of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients.  We have shown that SF3B1 knockdown in four myeloid cell lines resulted in inhibition of cell growth and disruption of the cell cycle. It has recently been reported that Sf3b1+/− mice showed reduced numbers of HSC and compromised reconstitution capacity in lethally irradiated mice.14, 15 Thus, reduced expression of SF3B1 appears to result in impaired cell growth in hematopoietic cells. Similar observations have been made following reduced expression of other splicing factor genes, including U2AF1.3, 4, 34  We used two different microarray platforms to identify genes deregulated at the transcriptional and exon level by SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Gene expression profiling identified many deregulated genes, with four genes consistently upregulated, including TFDP1, and five genes downregulated, including CREBZF, in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown, several of which have a role in the control of cell growth. TFDP1 is involved in the control of transcriptional activity of G1/S cell cycle checkpoint genes,35 and CREBZF is a potent suppressor of cell growth, the effects of which are mediated through the tumor suppressor p53.36 Next, we employed exon-junction arrays to study the transcriptome in K562 and TF1 cells. We identified many differentially expressed exons and differentially regulated splicing variants in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of the CDC7 and SRSF11 genes, involved in cell cycle regulation and splicing, respectively, and of the TP53 gene. Several pathways including cell cycle, RNA processing, mitochondrion and apoptosis/p53 pathway were consistently deregulated in the cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  In summary, our data on myeloid cell lines suggest that the phenotype observed in cells with SF3B1 knockdown is mediated by aberrant splicing and expression of target genes involved in key biological processes.  RNA-Seq is the method of choice for a comprehensive analysis of global gene expression and splicing. In all relevant studies published to date, RNA-Seq has been performed on unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells from a small number of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations (n⩽3 per study), revealing interesting data.11, 37, 38 MDS arise in the HSC, and it is thus of critical importance that the effects of SF3B1 mutation on the transcriptome are studied in the cell of origin. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq on purified bone marrow CD34+ cells from 12 MDS patients, eight with ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutation and four without mutation in other splicing factor genes, and from five healthy controls.  We identified many significantly differentially expressed genes at the transcript level and the exon level when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. CD34+ cells from RCMD-RS and RARS patients display a particular expression profile of mitochondria-related genes;17, 20 we observed upregulation of ALAS2 (heme biosynthesis enzyme) and downregulation of ABCB7 (involved in the transport of iron from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm) in SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control, in agreement with our previous reports.17, 20 SLC25A37, encoding a mitochondrial iron importer, and GLRX5, encoding another mitochondrial protein, were both significantly upregulated in CD34+ cells of SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control. A recent study showed SLC25A37 mRNA upregulation in SF3B1 mutant bone marrow mononuclear cells of three MDS patients with RARS/-T.38 Evidence is thus mounting to suggest that upregulation of the iron importer SLC25A37 and downregulation of iron exporter ABCB7 may be linked to the increased mitochondrial iron accumulation observed in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts.39 Deregulation of these genes could also be consistent with an impaired ability of mitochondrial pathways to use iron that may result in an attempt to increase iron availability.  Importantly, we observed many genes associated with porphyrin and heme biosynthesis showing differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant cases, indicating altered splicing. These include ALAD and UROD when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and ALAS2 and PPOX when comparing with wild type. We suggest that the aberrant expression and exon usage of mitochondrial and heme-related genes in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation has a role in ring sideroblast formation and abnormal iron homeostasis observed in this patient group. Intriguingly, the most common congenital sideroblastic anemia (X-linked sideroblastic anemia) results from an ALAS2 mutation.40  The relative expression levels of the transcription factors GATA1 and GATA2 differed from normal in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation. The dynamic and strictly regulated change of expression from GATA2 to GATA1 during erythropoiesis has a crucial role,41 and any alteration of this pattern may be predicted to lead to aberrant erythropoiesis. We suggest that the aberrant expression and splicing of erythroid-related genes observed in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation may have a role in the ineffective erythropoiesis found in these patients.  In a previous study, RNA-Seq was used to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow mononuclear cells of two MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation to that of one healthy control.11 One hundred and thirty genes showed significant differential expression, 28 of which overlap with the genes differentially expressed between SF3B1 mutant and control in our study of CD34+ cells. These genes include MAP3K8 and CLEC5A, which have been previously shown to be downregulated in MDS.19, 42 Furthermore, 350 genes showed differential exon usage, and 52 of these were in common with the genes showing differential exon usage in our study of CD34+ cells. The overlapping genes include EZH1, ASXL1, CBL1 and SMAD4.  The mutant forms of ASXL1, CBL and TP53 are known to have an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of MDS, and intriguingly all these genes were found to be alternatively spliced in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  A recent study identified a DNA damage-induced BRCA1 protein complex containing BCLAF1 and SF3B1 (BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex).33 In response to DNA damage, the complex regulates pre-mRNA splicing of genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair and hence affects their transcription and pre-mRNA maturation.33 Importantly, we found many of the genes regulated by this complex to be differentially expressed and to show differential exon usage in our study. Genes showing differential transcript level changes included BIRC3 and BCL2A1, whereas NUMA1 showed differential exon usage when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we also found differential exon usage of the PIAS1 gene, a DNA damage response regulator.43, 44 It has been demonstrated that abrogation of members of this complex including BRCA1 and BCLAF1 results in genomic instability,33 a common feature of malignant cells. In MDS patients with mutant SF3B1, the function of this complex may be impaired, with possible downstream effects on the efficiency of DNA damage repair.  Many genes involved in RNA splicing and processing were found to show differential transcript levels, as well as differential exon usage in our study, including HNRNPD, U2AF2, PRPF8 and RBM25. A recent study showed RNA processing genes to be misspliced in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of MDS/AML patients with U2AF1 mutation.45 Intriguingly, there is limited overlap between the genes misspliced as a result of U2AF1 mutation and the RNA processing/splicing genes deregulated/aberrantly spliced in our SF3B1 mutant cases in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, suggesting that this process may be affected by different splicing mutations even if their target genes are distinct.  A recent study showed that defects in the splicing factor gene PRPF8 result in missplicing in myeloid malignancies and are associated with the presence of ring sideroblasts in advanced MDS and AML.46 Interestingly, we observed differential exon usage of PRPF8 in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with control in our study, indicating a link between SF3B1 and PRPF8 and the ring sideroblast phenotype. Our finding of differential exon usage of multiple RNA processing/splicing genes in the HSPC of cases with SF3B1 mutation points towards an exacerbation of aberrant splicing, with a wider number of downstream target genes affected. Emerging evidence from our study on SF3B1 and the study on U2AF145 thus supports the hypothesis that in MDS patients harboring splicing factor mutations, there is widespread disruption of the splicing machinery as a consequence of downstream effects of the mutant protein. Loss-of-function mutations in zebrafish Prpf8 have been shown to result in missplicing of TP53.47 We found TP53 to be aberrantly spliced in MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation compared with wild type and control.  Splicing factor mutations, including SF3B1, are considered to be founder mutations and must confer a selective growth advantage to the HSC, but how this occurs remains a mystery. We have identified differential splicing in several genes known to have a role in MDS pathogenesis, including TP53 and ASXL1, as well as genes involved in DNA damage repair, in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations. We suggest that the aberrant splicing of such genes may confer oncogenic properties that help drive the malignant process. In this study, we have determined the target genes of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients with ring sideroblasts, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying this phenotype.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and related disorders (myelodysplasia) comprise a group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by deregulated, dysplastic blood cell production and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)1 . Although the prevalence ofMDS has not been determined precisely, more than 10,000 people are estimated to develop myelodysplasia annually in the United States2 . Their indolent clinical course before leukaemic transformation and ineffective haematopoiesis with evidence of myeloid dysplasia indicate a pathogenesis distinct from that involved in de novo AML. Currently, a number of gene mutations and cytogenetic changes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS, including mutations of RAS, TP53 and RUNX1, and more recently ASXL1, c-CBL, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, TET2 and EZH2 (ref. 3). Nevertheless, mutations of this set of genes do not fully explain the pathogenesis of MDS because they are also commonly found in other myeloid malignancies and roughly 20% of MDS cases have no known genetic changes (ref. 4 and unpublished data). In particular, the genetic alterations responsible for the dysplastic phenotypes and ineffective haematopoiesis of myelodysplasia are poorly understood. Meanwhile, the recent development of massively parallel sequencing technologies has provided an expanded opportunity to discover genetic changes across the entire genomes or protein-coding sequences in human cancers at a single-nucleotide level5–10, which could be successfully applied to the genetic analysis of myelodysplasia to obtain a better understanding of its pathogenesis. Overview of genetic alterations In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of paired tumour/control DNA from 29 patients with myelodysplasia (Supplementary Table 1). Although incapable of detecting non-coding mutations and gene rearrangements, the whole-exome approach is a well-established strategy for obtaining comprehensive registries of protein-coding mutations at low cost and high performance. With a mean coverage of 133.8, 80.4% of the target sequences were analysed at more than 320 depth on average (Supplementary Fig. 1). All the candidates for somatic mutations (N 5 497) generated through our data analysis pipeline were subjected to validation using Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Methods I and Supplementary Fig. 2). Finally, 268 non-synonymous somatic mutations were confirmed with an overall true positive rate of 53.9% (Supplementary Fig. 3), including 206 missense, 25 nonsense, and 10 splice site mutations, and 27 frameshift-causing insertions/deletions (indels) (Supplementary Fig. 4). The mutation rate of 9.2 (0–21) per sample was significantly lower than that in solid tumours (16.2–302)7,11,12 and multiple myeloma (32.4)6 , but was comparable to that in AML (7.3–13)13–15 and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (11.5)16. Combined with the genomic copy number profile obtained by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array karyotyping, this array of somatic mutations provided a landscape of myelodysplasia genomes (Supplementary Fig. 5)17,18. 1 Cancer Genomics Project, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan. 2 Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 3 Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Manheim of the University of Heidelberg, 1–3 Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer, Mannheim 68167, Germany. 4 Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 5 Laboratory of Functional Genomics, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 6 Laboratory of Sequence Data Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 7 Division of Systems Biomedical Technology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 8 Nakauchi Stem Cell and Organ Regeneration Project, Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 9 Department of Hematology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8571, Japan. 10Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Ohtsuka Hospital, 2-8-1 Minami-Ohtsuka, Toshima-ku, Tokyo 170-0005, Japan. 11Division of Hematology, Internal Medicine, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, 1-30 Fujigaoka, Aoba-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 227-8501, Japan. 12Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich 81377, Germany. 13Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8700 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA. 14National University of Singapore, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, 28 Medical Drive, Singapore 117456, Singapore. 15Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University, 199 Tung Hwa North Rd, Taipei 105, Taiwan. *These authors contributed equally to this work. 64 | NATURE | VOL 478 | 6 OCTOBER 2011 ©2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved Novel gene targets in myelodysplasia The list of the somatic mutations (Supplementary Table 2) included most of the known gene targets in myelodysplasia with similar mutation frequencies to those previously reported, indicating an acceptable sensitivity of the current study. The mutations of the known gene targets, however, accounted for only 12.3% of all detected mutations (N 5 33), and the remaining 235 mutations involved previously unreported genes. Among these, recurrently mutated genes in multiple cases are candidate targets of particular interest, for which high mutation rates are expected in general populations. In fact, 8 of the 12 recurrently mutated genes were among the well-described gene targets in myelodysplasia (Supplementary Table 3). However, what immediately drew our attention were the recurrent mutations involving U2AF35 (also known as U2AF1), ZRSR2 and SRSF2 (SC35), because they belong to the common pathway known as RNA splicing. Including an additional three genes mutated in single cases (SF3A1, SF3B1 and PRPF40B), six components of the splicing machinery were mutated in 16 out of the 29 cases (55.2%) in a mutually exclusive manner (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2). Frequent mutations in splicing machinery RNA splicing is accomplished by a well-ordered recruitment, rearrangement and/or disengagement of a set of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes (U1, U2, and either U4/5/6 or U11/12), as well as many other protein components onto the pre-mRNAs. Notably, the mutated components of the spliceosome were all engaged in the initial steps of RNA splicing, except for PRPF40B, whose functions in RNA splicing are poorly defined. Making physical interactions with SF1 and a serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein, such as SRSF1 or SRSF2, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) that consists of the U2AF65 (U2AF2)– U2AF35 heterodimer, is involved in the recognition of the 39 splice site (39SS) and its nearby polypyrimidine tract, which is thought to be required for the subsequent recruitment of the U2 snRNP, containing SF3A1 as well as SF3B1, to establish the splicing A complex (Fig. 1)19. ZRSR2 (or Urp), is another essential component of the splicing machinery. Showing a close structural similarity to U2AF35, ZRSR2 physically interacts with U2AF65, as well as SRSF1 and SRSF2, with a distinct function from its homologue, U2AF35 (ref. 20). To confirm and extend the initial findings in the whole-exome sequencing, we studied mutations of the above six genes together with three additional spliceosome-related genes, including U2AF65, SF1 and SRSF1, in a large series of myeloid neoplasms (N 5 582) using a high-throughput mutation screen of pooled DNA followed by confirmation/identification of candidate mutations (refs 21 and 22 and Supplementary Methods II). In total, 219 mutations were identified in 209 out of the 582 specimens of myeloid neoplasms through validating 313 provisional positive events in the pooled DNA screen (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). The mutations among four genes, U2AF35 (N 5 37), SRSF2 (N 5 56), ZRSR2 (N 5 23) and SF3B1 (N 5 79), explained most of the mutations with much lower mutational rates for SF3A1 (N 5 8), PRPF40B (N 5 7), U2AF65 (N 5 4) and SF1 (N 5 5) (Fig. 2). Mutations of the splicing machinery were highly specific to diseases showing myelodysplastic features, including MDS either with (84.9%) or without (43.9%) increased ring sideroblasts, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (54.5%), and therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (25.8%), but were rare in de novo AML (6.6%) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (9.4%) (Fig. 3a). The mutually exclusive pattern of the mutations in these splicing pathway genes was confirmed in this large case series, suggesting a common impact of these mutations on RNA splicing and the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia (Fig. 3b). The frequencies of mutations showed significant differences across disease types. Surprisingly, SF3B1 mutations were found in the majority of the cases with MDS characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, that is, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) (19/23 or 82.6%) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia with $ 15% ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (38/50 or 76%) with much lower mutation frequencies in other myeloid neoplasms.

RNA splicing is initiated by the recruitment of U1 snRNP to the 59SS. SF1 and the larger subunit of the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF), U2AF65, bind the branch point sequence (BPS) and its downstream polypyrimidine tract, respectively. The smaller subunit of U2AF (U2AF35) binds to the AG dinucleotide of the 39SS, interacting with both U2AF65 and a SR protein, such as SRSF2, through its UHM and RS domain, comprising the earliest splicing complex (E complex). ZRSR2 also interacts with U2AF and SR proteins to perform essential functions in RNA splicing. After the recognition of the 39SS, U2 snRNP, together with SF3A1 and SF3B1, is recruited to the 39SS to generate the splicing complex A.

All rights reserved for 4.3% and 12.9% of MDS cases, respectively, where deregulated iron metabolism has been implicated in the development of refractory anaemia23. With such high mutation frequencies and specificity, the SF3B1 mutations were thought to be almost pathognomonic to these MDS subtypes characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, and strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS in these categories. Less conspicuously but significantly, SRSF2 mutations were more frequent in CMML cases (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Thus, although commonly involving the E/A splicing complexes, different mutations may still have different impacts on cell functions, contributing to the determination of discrete disease phenotypes. For example, studies have demonstrated that SRSF2 was also involved in the regulation of DNA stability and that depletion of SRSF2 can lead to genomic instability24. Of interest in this context, regardless of disease subtypes, samples with SRSF2 mutations were shown to have significantly more mutations of other genes compared with U2AF35 mutations (P 5 0.001, multiple regression analysis) (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, with a rare exception of A26V in a single case, the mutations of U2AF35 exclusively involved two highly conserved amino acid positions (S34 or Q157) within the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger motifs flanking the U2AF homology motif (UHM) domain. SRSF2 mutations exclusively occurred at P95 within an intervening sequence between the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and arginine/ serine-rich (RS) domains (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs 8 and 9). Similarly, SF3B1 mutations predominantly involved K700 and, to a lesser extent, K666, H662 and E622, which are also conserved across species (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 10). The involvement of recurrent amino acid positions in these spliceosome genes strongly indicated a gain-of-function nature of these mutations, which has been a welldocumented scenario in other oncogenic mutations25. On the other hand, the 23 mutations in ZRSR2 (Xp22.1) were widely distributed along the entire coding region (Fig. 2). Among these, 14 mutations were nonsense or frameshift changes, or involved splicing donor/acceptor sites that caused either a premature truncation or a large structural change of the protein, leading to loss-of-function. Combined with their strong male preference for the mutation (14/14 cases), ZRSR2 most likely acts as a tumour suppressor gene with an X-linked recessive mode of genetic action. The remaining nine ZRSR2 mutations were missense changes and found in both males (six cases) and females (three cases), whose somatic origin was only confirmed in two cases. However, neither the dbSNP database (build131 and 132) nor the 1000 Genomes database (May 2011 snp calls) contained these missense nucleotides, suggesting that many, if not all, of these missense changes are likely to represent functional somatic changes, especially those found in males. Interrogation of these hot spots for mutations in U2AF35 and SRSF2 found no mutations among lymphoid neoplasms, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (N 5 24) or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (N 5 87) (data not shown). RNA splicing and spliceosome mutations Because the splicing pathway mutations in myelodysplasia widely and specifically affect the major components of the splicing complexes E/A in a mutually exclusive manner, the common consequence of these mutations is logically the impaired recognition of 39SSs that would lead to the production of aberrantly spliced mRNA species. To appreciate this and also to gain an insight into the biological/biochemical impact of these splicing mutations, we expressed the wild-type and the mutant (S34F) U2AF35 in HeLa cells using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) marking (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Methods III) and examined their effects on gene expression in these cells using GeneChip Human genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix), followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Supplementary Methods IV)26. Intriguingly, the GSEA disclosed a significant enrichment of the genes on the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway among the significantly upregulated genes in mutant U2AF35-transduced HeLa cells (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 11a and Supplementary Table 7), which was SRSF2 (0.7%) PRPF40B (0.7%) SF3A1 (0.7%) Dup (0.7%) U2AF35 (1.9%) SRSF2 (1.9%) ZRSR2 (1.9%) PRPF40B (1.9%) SF1 (1.9%) MDS without RS (N = 155) RARS / RCMD-RS (N = 73) CMML (N = 88) De novo AML (N = 151) MPN (N = 53) b RARS/RCMD-RS CMML AML/MDS De novo AML MPN a ZR AML/MDS (N = 62) No mut (90.6%) U2AF35  (11.6%) SRSF2 (11.6%) ZRSR2 (7.7%) SF3B1 (6.5%) No mut (56.1%) SF3B1 (75.3%) No mut (15.1%) SRSF2 (5.5%) U2AF35  (8.0%) SRSF2 (28.4%) ZRSR2 (8.0%) SF3B1 (4.5%) SF3A1 (1.3% ) PRPF40B (1.9%) U2AF65 (0.6%) SF1 (1.3%) Dup (1.3%) Dup (2.7%) ZRSR2 (1.4%) Dup (3.4%) U2AF65 (1.1%) SF3A1 (1.1% ) No mut (74.2%) U2AF35  (9.7%) SRSF2  (6.5%) ZRSR2 (1.6%) SF3B1 (4.8%) SF3A1 (1.6% ) PRPF40B (1.6% ) No mut (93.4%) U2AF35 (1.3%) SF3B1 (2.6%) No mut (45.5%) MDS without RS SF3B1 SRSF2 U2AF35 ZRSR2 SF3A1 PRPF40B U2AF65 SF1 Figure 3 | Frequencies and distribution of spliceosome pathway gene mutations in myeloid neoplasms. a, Frequencies of spliceosome pathway mutations among 582 cases with various myeloid neoplasms. b, Distribution of mutations in eight spliceosome genes, where diagnosis of each sample is shown by indicated colours. RESEARCH ARTICLE 66 | NATURE | VOL 478 | 6 OCTOBER 2011 ©2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Methods 5V). A similar result was also observed for the gene expression profile of an MDS-derived cell line (TF-1) transduced with the S34F mutant (Supplementary Figs 11b, c). The NMD activation by themutant U2AF35was suppressed significantly by the cooverexpression of the wild-type protein (Supplementary Fig. 11d), indicating that the effect of the mutant protein was likely to be mediated by inhibition of thefunctions of the wild-type protein. Given that the NMD pathway, known as mRNA surveillance, provides a post-transcriptional mechanism for recognizing and eliminating abnormal transcripts that prematurely terminate translation27, the result of the GSEA analyses indicated that the mutant U2AF35 induced abnormal RNA splicing in HeLa and TF-1 cells, leading to the generation of unspliced RNA species having a premature stop codon and induction of the NMD activity. To confirm this, we next performed whole transcriptome analysis in these cells using the GeneChip Human exon 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix), in which we differentially tracked the behaviour of two discrete sets of probes showing different level of evidence of being exons, that is, ‘Core’ (authentic exons) and ‘non-Core’ (more likely introns) sets (Supplementary Methods IV and Supplementary Fig. 12). As shown in Fig. 4d, the Core and non-Core set probes were differentially enriched among probes showing significant difference in expression between wild-type and mutant-transduced cells (false discovery rate (FDR) 5 0.01). The Core set probes were significantly enriched in those probes significantly downregulated in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells compared with wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, whereas the non-Core set probes were enriched in those probes significantly upregulated in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4e). The significant differential enrichment was also demonstrated, even when all probe sets were included (Fig. 4f). Moreover, the significantly differentially expressed Core set probes tended to be up- and downregulated in wild-type and mutant U2AF35-transduced cells compared with mock-transduced cells, respectively, and vice versa for the differentially expressed non-Core set probes (Fig. 4e). Combined, these exon array results indicated that the wild-type U2AF35 correctly promoted authentic RNA splicing, whereas the mutant U2AF35 inhibited this processes, rendering non-Core and therefore, more likely intronic sequences to remain unspliced. The abnormal splicing in mutantU2AF35-transduced cells was more directly demonstrated by sequencing mRNAs extracted from HeLa cells, in which expression of the wild-type and mutant (S34F) U2AF35 were induced by doxycycline. First, after adjusting by the total number of mapped reads, the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells showed an increased read counts in the exon fraction, but reduced counts in other fractions, compared with mutant U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4g). The reads from the mutant-transduced cells were mapped to broader genomic regions compared with those from the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, which were largely explained by non-exon reads (Fig. 4h). Finally, the number of those reads that encompassed the authentic exon/intron junctions was significantly increased in mutantU2AF35-transduced cells compared withwild-type U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4i and Supplementary Methods VI). These results clearly demonstrated that failure of splicing ubiquitously occurred in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells. A typical example of abnormal splicing in mutant-transduced cells and the list of significantly unspliced exons are shown in Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 8, respectively. Biological consequence of U2AF35 mutations Finally, we examined the biological effects of compromised functions of the E/A splicing complexes. First, TF-1 and HeLa cells were transduced with lentivirus constructs expressing either the S34F U2AF35 mutant or wild-type U2AF35 under a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Figs 14a and 15a), and cell proliferation was examined after the induction of their expression. Unexpectedly, after the induction of gene expression with doxycycline, the mutant U2AF35-transduced cells, but not the wildtype U2AF35-transduced cells, showed reduced cell proliferation (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 15b) with a marked increase in the G2/M fraction (G2/M arrest) together with enhanced apoptosis as a 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.5 2.5 0.5 SMG5 DHX34 UPF1 SMG1 UPF3B BTZ UPF2 SMG7 SMG6 * * * * * * * * * 3.0 Mock S34F U2AF35  P < 0.01 (n = 5) b d 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 P = 0.0026 0.0 SMG5 SMG9 DHX34 UPF1 SMG1 UPF3B BTZ UPF2 SMG7 MAGOH SMG6 SMG8 Y14 eIF4A3 PYM UPF3A hNAG WT S34F Mock S34F WT U2AF35 AntiU2AF35 AntiFlag Anti- β actin HeLa S34F MockWT Normalized intensity S34F WT 10–1 10–3 101 100 10–2 S34F Mock Normalized intensity Enrichment score U2AF35 Hits cNormalized expression e f S.I.

All rights reserved indicated by the increased sub-G1 fraction and annexin V-positive cells (Fig. 5c, d, Supplementary Fig. 14b and Supplementary Methods VI). To confirm the growth-suppressive effect of U2AF35 mutants in vitro, a highly purified haematopoietic stem cell population (CD342cKit1ScaI1Lin2, CD342KSL) prepared from C57BL/6 (B6)-Ly5.1 mouse bone marrow28 was retrovirally transduced with either the mutant (S34F, Q157P and Q157R) or wild-type U2AF35, or the mock constructs, each harbouring the EGFP marker gene (Supplementary Fig. 16). The ability of these transduced cells to reconstitute the haematopoietic system was tested in a competitive reconstitution assay. The transduced cells were mixed with whole bone marrow cells from B6-Ly5.1/5.2 F1 mice, transplanted into lethally irradiated B6-Ly5.2 recipients, and peripheral blood chimaerism derived from EGFPpositive cellswasassessed6 weeks after transplantation byflow cytometry. We confirmed that each recipient mouse received comparable numbers of EGFP-positive cells among the different retrovirus groups by estimating the percentage of EGFP-positive cells and overall proliferation in transduced cells by ex vivo tracking. Also no significant difference was observed in their homing capacity to bone marrow as assessed by transwell migration assays (Supplementary Fig. 17). As shown in Fig. 5e, the wild-typeU2AF35-transduced cells showed a slightly higher reconstitution capacity than the mock-transduced cells. On the other hand, the recipients of the cells transduced with the various U2AF35 mutants showed significantly lower EGFP-positive cell chimaerism than those of either the mock- or the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, indicating a compromised reconstitution capacity of the haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells expressing the U2AF35 mutants. In summary, these mutants lead to loss-of-function of U2AF35 most probably by acting in a dominant-negative fashion to the wild-type protein. Discussion Our whole-exome sequencing study unexpectedly unmasked a complexity of novel pathway mutations found in approximately 45% to 85% of myelodysplasia patients depending on the disease subtypes, which affected multiple but distinctive components of the splicing machinery and, as such, demonstrated the unquestionable power of massively parallel sequencing technologies in cancer research. The RNA splicing system comprises essential cellular machinery, through which eukaryotes can achieve successful transcription and guarantee the functional diversity of their protein species using alternative splicing in the face of a limited number of genes29. Accordingly, the meticulous regulation of this machinery should be indispensable for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis30, deregulation of which causes severe developmental abnormalities31,32. The current discovery of frequent mutations of the splicing pathway in myelodysplasia, therefore, represents another remarkable example that illustrates how cancer develops by targeting critical cellular functions. It also provides an intriguing insight into the mechanism of ‘cancer specific’ alternative splicing, which have long been implicated in the development of cancer, including MDS and other haematopoietic neoplasms33,34. In myelodysplasia, the major targets of spliceosome mutations seemed to be largely confined to the components of the E/A splicing complex, among others to SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF35 and ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent, to SF3A1, SF1, U2AF65 and PRPF40B. The broad coverage of the wide spectrum of spliceosome components in our exome sequencing was likely to preclude frequent involvement of other components on this pathway (Supplementary Fig. 18). The surprising frequency and specificity of these mutations in this complex, together with the mutually exclusive manner they occurred, unequivocally indicate that the compromised function of the E/A complex is a hallmark of this unique category of myeloid neoplasms, playing a central role in the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia. The close relationship between the mutation types and unique disease subtypes also support their pivotal roles in MDS. Given the critical functions of the E/A splicing complex on the precise 39SS recognition, the logical consequence of these relevant mutations would be the impaired splicing involving diverse RNA species. In fact, when expressed in HeLa cells, the mutant U2AF35 induced global abnormalities of RNA splicing, leading to increased production of transcripts having unspliced intronic sequences. On the other hand, the functional link between the abnormal splicing of RNA species and the phenotype of myelodysplasia is still unclear. Mutant U2AF35 seemed to suppress cell growth/proliferation and induce apoptosis rather than confer a growth advantage or promote clonal selection. ZRSR2 knockdown in HeLa cells has been reported to also result in reduced viability, arguing for the common consequence of these pathway mutations35. These observations suggested that the oncogenic actions of these splicing pathway mutations are distinct from what is expected for classical oncogenes, such as mutated kinases and signal transducers, but could be more related to cell differentiation. Of note in this regard, the commonest clinical presentation of MDS is severe cytopenia in multiple cell lineages due to ineffective haematopoiesis with increased apoptosis rather than unlimited cell proliferation1 . In this regard, lessons may be learned from the recent findings on the pathogenesis of the 5q2 syndrome, where haploinsufficiency of RPS14 leads to increased apoptosis of erythroid progenitors, but not myeloproliferation36,37.

All rights reserved pathogenesis of MDS, where the broad spectrum of RNA species affected by impaired splicing hampers identification of responsible gene targets. Moreover, the mutated components of the splicing machinery have distinct function of their own other than direct regulation of RNA splicing, involved in elongation and DNA stability, which may be important to determine specific disease phenotypes. Clearly, more studies are required to answer these questions through understanding of the molecular basis of their oncogenic actions. METHODS SUMMARY Whole-exome sequencing of paired tumour/normal DNA samples from the 29 patients was performed after informed consent was obtained. SNP array-based copy number analysis was performed as previously described17,18. Mutation analysis of the splicing pathway genes in a set of 582 myeloid neoplasms were performed by first screening mutations in PCR-amplified pooled targets from 12 individuals, followed by validation/identification of the candidate mutations within the corresponding 12 individuals by Sanger sequencing. Flag-tagged cDNAs of the wild-type and mutant U2AF35 were generated by in vitro mutagenesis, constructed into a murine stem cell virus-based retroviral vector as well as a tetracycline-inducible lentivirus-based expression vector, and used for gene transfer to CD342KSL cells and cultured cell lines, with EGFP marking, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from wild-type or mutant U2AF35-transduced HeLa and TF-1 cells, and analysed on microarrays. RNA sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Cell proliferation assays (MTT assays) on HeLa and TF-1 cells stably transduced with lentivirus U2AF35 constructs were performed in the presence or absence of doxycycline. For competitive reconstitution assays, CD342KSL cells collected from C57BL/6 (B6)- Ly5.1 mice were retrovirally transduced with various U2AF35 constructs with EGFP marking, and transplanted with competitor cells (B6-Ly5.1/5.2 F1 mouse origin) into lethally irradiated B6-Ly5.2 mice 48 h after gene transduction. Frequency of EGFP-positive cells was assessed in peripheral blood by flow cytometry 6 weeks after the transplantation (Supplementary MethodsVII). The primer sets used for validation of gene mutations and qPCR of NMD gene expression are listed in Supplementary Tables 9211. A complete description of the materials and methods is provided in the Supplementary Information.

132||Assessing the functional significance of novel putative oncogenes remains a significant challenge given the limitations of current loss-of-function tools. Here, we describe a method that employs TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of inducible degron tags (Degron-KI) that provides a versatile approach for the functional characterization of novel cancer genes and addresses many of the shortcomings of current tools. The Degron-KI system allows for highly specific, inducible, and allele-targeted inhibition of endogenous protein function, and the ability to titrate protein depletion with this system is able to better mimic pharmacologic inhibition compared with RNAi or genetic knockout approaches. The Degron-KI system was able to faithfully recapitulate the effects of pharmacologic EZH2 and PI3Ka inhibitors in cancer cell lines. The application of this system to the study of a poorly understood putative oncogene, SF3B1, provided the first causal link between SF3B1 hotspot mutations and splicing alterations. Surprisingly, we found that SF3B1-mutant cells are not dependent upon the mutated allele for in vitro growth, but instead depend upon the function of the remaining wild-type alleles. Collectively, these results demonstrate the broad utility of the Degron-KI system for the functional characterization of cancer genes. Cancer Res; 75(10); 1949–58. 2015 AACR. Introduction Although cancer genome sequencing studies have identified a large number of recurrently mutated genes (1, 2), functional studies are required to determine whether or not these genes present viable targets for cancer therapy. For instance, it is pivotal to establish that potential targets are required for tumor maintenance rather than representing initiating lesions that are no longer required for neoplastic growth. RNAi technology has been widely used to interrogate oncogene dependence by testing the impact of gene/protein knockdown in cell lines harboring the respective gene or pathway alterations. While RNAi has revolutionized our ability to perform genetic loss-of-function studies, it is known to be fraught with significant off-target effects (3–5). RNAi-based offtarget effects are particularly problematic for studies using cell proliferation as a phenotypic readout, as any off-target activity toward essential housekeeping genes has the potential to yield a false-positive result. In fact, it is likely that the propensity of RNAibased methods to yield false-positive results significantly contributes to the recently raised concerns around the lack of reproducibility in cancer biology publications (6, 7). Many cancer genes, such as oncogenes, exhibit dominant behavior, where only one allele is mutated and thought to drive the tumorigenic effect. In order to distinguish the effects of the mutated from wild-type alleles, a method that allows for the selective inhibition of one but not the other allele would be highly desirable. It is often challenging or impossible, however, to design RNAi reagents that can discriminate between the mutant and wild-type alleles, owing to sequence constraints and the general tolerance of single-base-pair mismatches in many positions (8). Recent advances in somatic knockout technologies, in particular the CRISPR/Cas9 system (9), provide powerful tools for genetic loss-of-function studies. While being more efficient than previous somatic genome engineering technologies, CRISPR-based gene knockouts have significant limitations for the study of essential genes, as gene inactivation is not inducible, generally occurs with slow kinetics (several days), and cannot be reversed in order to mimic intermittent target inhibition. Thus, CRISPR can readily be applied toward the knockout of tumor suppressor genes, but provides less utility toward the study of essential genes such as oncogenes due to the inability to generate stable knockout clones for genes required for cancer cell proliferation. To address some of the shortcomings of current genetic tools toward the functional characterization of novel oncogenes, we sought to develop a system that ideally would (i) have minimal off-target effects, (ii) enable allele-specific targeting, and (iii) allow for inducible and reversible gene depletion. In this study, we devised a method that allows for allele-specific regulation of endogenous proteins using a chemically regulated destabilization domain (DD) tag (10). We refer to this method as Degron-knockin (Degron-KI) and demonstrate its application to interrogate cancer dependence of known and novel oncogenes. 1 Oncology Disease Area, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts. 2 Oncology Translational Medicine, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts. 3 Developmental and Molecular Pathways, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Published OnlineFirst March 18, 2015; DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2930  Materials and Methods Cell line, plasmid, and compound Cell lines and culture media are as follows: HCT116 cells (McCoy's 5A Medium GIBCO#16600 with 10% FBS); Mel-Juso, ESS1, and NCIH1048 cells (RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS); Mel202 (RPMI-1640 with 15% FBS, from Schepens Eye Institute); Karpas422 (RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS and 1  Glutamax from LifeTech). At low seeding density, Mel202 requires 30% conditioned medium to support cell proliferation. All lines were authenticated by SNP fingerprinting, and generally used within 20 passages. TALENs targeting p53 and SF3B1 were purchased from LifeTech. Backbone donor vector for homologous recombination was generated by gene synthesis from LifeTech. Left and right homologous recombination arms were obtained from genomic PCR and cloned into the restriction sites in the backbone donor vector (Nde1 and Xho1 for the left arm; EcoR1 and Not1 for the right arm, Xho1 site was removed in the end). Detailed information on the targeting sequences of TALENs and CRISPR as well as the donor vector design and PCR primers are provided in Supplementary Experimental Procedures. The chemical compounds used in this study are as follows: Doxorubicin (Sigma) and Nutlin-3 (Sigma); BYL719 (Novartis); El1 (Novartis); Shield- 1 (Clontech). Shield-1 powder was dissolved in 100% EtOH at 1mmol/L and stored at 20 C. Shield-1 was added to the fresh tissue culture media right before usage. Antibodies Primary antibodies: p53 (DO-1, sc-126; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1C12, #2524 CST for immunofluorescence), p21 (c-19, sc-397; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), EZH2 (5246s, CST, both for Western blot and immunofluorescence), H3 (9715s; CST), H3K27Me3 (9756s; CST), PIK3CA (4249s; CST), pAKT (4058L; CST), AKT (9272s; CST), GAPDH (IMG-5019A-1, IMGENEX), SF3B1 (p221-3; MBL International, both for Western blot and immunofluorescence).

Positive clones were further verified by junction PCR and locus PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2). In vitro cell proliferation (colony formation, three-dimensional growth assay) Colony formation: Cells were seeded at a very low density in 6- well plates for 10 to 14 days, followed by crystal violet staining (0.5 g crystal violet, 27 mL 37% formaldehyde, 100 mL 10  PBS, 10 mL methanol, 863 dH20 to 1L). Seeded cell numbers: HCT116 (1,500 cells), NCIH1048 (10,000 cells), Mel-Juso (3,000 cells), ESS-1 (3,000 cells), Mel202 (6,000 cells). Conditioned medium (30%) was added in the Mel202 foci formation assay. Mel202 three-dimensional (3D) growth assay: 300 cells were seeded in 80 mL of culture medium (containing 30% conditional medium) in a 96-well ultra-low attachment round bottom plate (Costar; 7007). Pictures were taken after 9 days. In both cases, fresh Shld compound was added every 5 days. RNAseq analysis Reads were aligned to the human genome using a reference transcriptome and a modified version of Tophat, as previously described (11). Expression levels for UCSC genes and transcripts were determined using Cufflinks (12), summed for genes with multiple genomic loci, then rescaled so that the upper quartile gene expression level in each experiment was 10. Sequencing reads and gene expression values were deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO ID: Series GSE66719). Details of RNAseq analysis and other Materials and Methods can be found in Supplementary Experimental Procedures. Results The DD tag is a derivative of human FKBP12 that is stabilized in the presence of the small-molecule ligand Shield-1 (Shld), but becomes unstable and subjected to proteasomal degradation once Shld compound is withdrawn (10). We reasoned that introduction of the DD tag by homologous recombination at the N-terminus of endogenous genes should impart allele-specific protein stability regulation through addition or withdrawal of Shld (Fig. 1A). To test the feasibility of this approach, we examined if this system can be used to inducibly regulate the function of TP53, a critical tumor suppressor gene. The DD-tag fusion was knocked into the TP53 gene locus of the diploid HCT116 cell line using TALENs, and several clones were isolated by puromycin selection. The DD-tag fusion increases protein size by 12 kDA (Supplementary Fig. S1A), thus allowing for easy distinction of heterozygous clones, which express both DD-tagged and untagged protein, compared with homozygous clones, where only the DD-tagged version but no untagged endogenous protein is detectable. "Homozygous" DD-tagged clones can either represent clones that have the DD tag inserted in all alleles, or alternatively may harbor a DD knock-in of one allele with the remaining alleles being inactivated (leading to knock-out) through error-prone non-homologous end joining, thus resulting in expression of only the DD-tagged protein. While these two possibilities cannot easily be distinguished by Western blot, they become readily evident by targeted sequencing of the genomic insertion site (Supplementary Fig. S2). Notably, out of 24 puroresistant clones analyzed, 8 (33%) exhibited expression of only the DD-tagged p53 protein, indicating homozygous targeting (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The homozygous DD-p53 clone displayed efficient depletion of TP53 upon Shld withdrawal, whereas p53 protein levels were not altered by Shld removal in the parental HCT116 cells (Fig. 1B and C; Supplementary Figs. S3A and S4A). We next examined if the extent of p53 depletion by the Degron-KI system was sufficient to mirror a TP53 knockout phenotype by investigating its impact on DNA damage response and MDM2 inhibition (13), which require an intact p53 pathway. Similar to parental HCT116 cells, when cultured in the presence of Shld to stabilize the DD-p53 protein, the homozygous DD-p53 clone robustly activated the DNA damage response pathway when treated with the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin (Fig. 1D and E). In addition, the sensitivity of DD-p53 clone (in the presence of Shld) to the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 was similar to that of the parental cells (Fig. 1F), indicating that the DD-p53 protein retains wild-type function. Strikingly, Shld withdrawal in DD-p53 cells strongly suppressed the induction of p21 upon doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 1D and E) and rendered these cells insensitive to the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 (Fig. 1F). By contrast, Shld withdrawal had no effect in the parental cells (Fig. 1D, E, and F). Together, these findings demonstrate that the Degron-KI system is able to recapitulate a TP53 knockout phenotype.

Published OnlineFirst March 18, 2015; DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2930  We next sought to investigate whether the Degron-KI system can be used for the functional validation of oncogene dependence. Recurrent hotspot mutations in EZH2 have been described in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; ref. 14), and EZH2- mutated cell lines are sensitive to pharmacologic EZH2 inhibitors (15–19). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce a DD tag in the EZH2 locus in Karpas422 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2H), which harbor the EZH2 Y641N mutation and are sensitive to EZH2 inhibitors (16, 18, 19). The EZH2-wild-type cell line HCT116 was used as a negative control. CRISPR-based DD-tag insertion at the endogenous EZH2 locus in HCT116 cells was even more efficient than DD-p53 tagging with TALENs. In fact, when wild-type Cas9 was used, untagged EZH2 protein was almost undetectable in the polyclonal population following puromycin selection, indicating that the majority of cells had homozygous expression of the DD tag (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5C). By contrast, use of a Cas9 nickase mutant (20–22) resulted in mostly heterozygous DD-EZH2 targeting (Supplementary Fig. S5B), thus providing an approach to effectively generate both heterozygous and homozygous Degron-KI clones in HCT116 cells. Withdrawal of Shld caused destabilization of the DD-tagged EZH2 alleles in both HCT116 and Karpas422 Degron-KI clones (Fig. 2A and D; Supplementary Figs. S3B, 4B, and 6A), and resulted in robust inhibition of H3K27 tri-methylation, the major histone substrate of EZH2 (Fig. 2A and D; ref. 23). Notably, Shld withdrawal markedly impaired the proliferation of DD-EZH2–tagged Karpas422 cells, whereas no effect on cell growth was observed in the HCT116 control cell line (Fig. 2C and E), thus recapitulating the selective dependence observed with pharmacologic EZH2 inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B; ref. 19). Moreover, the inhibition of both H3K27 tri-methylation and proliferation occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, F, and G), demonstrating that the Degron-KI system can be used to mimic concentration-dependent inhibition by pharmacologic agents. To further establish the broad applicability of the Degron-KI system, we next applied it to PIK3CA, a well-established oncogene with several small-molecule inhibitors in clinical trials (24–26). DD tags were knocked into the PIK3CA locus of NCI-H1048, a Figure 1. Depletion of DD-p53 upon Shld withdrawal mimics p53 loss of function in Degron-KI–engineered HCT116 DD-p53 cells. A, schematic depiction of the Degron-KI strategy. TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9 induces double-strand breaks at the N-terminus of the coding region of the endogenous locus, which facilitates homologous recombination–mediated knock-in of the degron tag in the presence of the donor vector. The donor vector contains a PuroR -P2A-DD cassette that is flanked by left and right homology arms ( 1 kb each; black). After homologous recombination, the puromycin resistance gene and DD-tagged gene will be expressed under the control of the endogenous promoter due to the ribosomal skipping sequence P2A. B, Western blot of parental and homozygous DDp53–tagged HCT116 cells in the presence or absence of 1 mmol/L Shld.

DD-p53–tagged HCT116 cells were cultured in 1 mmol/L Shld, and lysates for Western blotting were harvested at the indicated times after Shld withdrawal. D and E, cells were treated with vehicle EtOH or Shld (1 mmol/L) for 24 hours, followed by doxorubicin (500 nmol/L) treatment for another 18 hours. Samples were collected for Western blot (D) and p21 qRT-PCR (E). F, dose response of p53-DD clone viability after treatment with MDM-2 inhibitor Nutlin-3. Cells were first treated with vehicle EtOH or Shld (1 mmol/L) for 24 hours, followed by Nutlin-3 treatment for 4 days.

In response to Shld withdrawal, homozygous DDtagged PIK3CA clones (Supplementary Fig. S2D and S2J) demonstrated robust suppression of p-AKT (a marker of PI3K pathway activation) and inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Fig. S4C). These phenotypes closely mirrored suppression of the PI3Ka pathway by the selective PI3Ka inhibitor NVPBYL719 (25). As was the case for the DD-EZH2 clones, both pathway modulation and growth inhibition in DD-tagged PIK3CA clones could be titrated by adjusting the amount of Shld (Fig. 3D and E), thus recapitulating the dose-responsiveness of a pharmacologic PI3Ka inhibitor (Fig. 3D and E). Furthermore, PI3Ka protein levels and downstream signaling (p-AKT inhibition) were markedly suppressed at 8 hours after Shld withdrawal, with some additional reduction by 24 hours (Fig. 3C). Collectively, the ability of the Degron-KI system to mirror the activity of pharmacologic inhibitors such as EZH2 and PI3Ka inhibitors demonstrates the utility of the Degron-KI system for the functional validation of oncogene dependence. We next set out to apply the Degron-KI system toward the study of a novel and less well-understood oncogene. The spliceosome component SF3B1 was recently found to be recurrently mutated in myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and uveal melanoma (27–31). SF3B1 mutations are generally heterozygous and cluster at codons 625, 666, and 700, a mutation pattern that is characteristic for oncogenes and suggests possible gain of function. Yet it remains unclear what functional role SF3B1 mutations may play during oncogenesis and whether deregulated SF3B1 activity is required for cancer maintenance. SF3B1 small-molecule inhibitors are currently under development and have entered clinical trials (32). The fact that SF3B1 is part of the spliceosome, however, raises the concern that panSF3B1 inhibitors may exhibit significant toxicities in normal tissues and thus present a very narrow therapeutic window. In order to address whether or not SF3B1 is broadly required for cellular growth, even in the absence of oncogenic alterations, we generated both heterozygous and homozygous DD-SF3B1 clones in Mel-Juso, a melanoma cell line expressing wild-type SF3B1 (Supplementary Fig. S2E). Depletion of one copy of SF3B1 in heterozygous DD-SF3B1 clones had no impact on growth (Fig. 4A and B, clone #3). By contrast, Shld withdrawal in homozygous DD-SF3B1 clones led to robust SF3B1 protein depletion and markedly impaired growth (Fig. 4A and B, clones #1 and #2; Fig. 4E; Supplementary Figs. S4D and 6B). As before, this Figure 2. EZH2 Degron-KI mirrors the activity of pharmacologic EZH2 inhibitors.

Together, these findings indicate that while SF3B1 is not haploinsufficient, complete inhibition of SF3B1 is not tolerated in SF3B1 wild-type cells, therefore substantiating the toxicity concerns for a pan-SF3B1 inhibitor. A potential avenue to circumvent the normal tissue toxicity of pan-SF3B1 inhibition would be the development of SF3B1 inhibitors that selectively target the mutant protein. However, given the challenges and resources required toward the development of mutant-selective inhibitors, it will be critical to confirm that SF3B1 mutations are in fact required for tumor maintenance. We therefore sought to employ the Degron-KI system to assess the impact of mutant-specific SF3B1 inhibition in two SF3B1-mutant cancer cell line models, the endometrial cell line ESS-1, and the uveal melanoma cell line Mel202. When analyzing DD-tagged ESS-1 clones, we noticed that this cell line is polyploid, expressing at least two wild-type and one mutant allele (K666N hotspot mutation). Allele-specific targeting was confirmed through allelic phasing of the DD tag with the K666N SF3B1 mutation by RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S8A–S8D), yielding several clones that selectively deplete either all copies of SF3B1, two copies, or only one copy of SF3B1, including clones that selective target only the mutant or wild-type alleles (Supplementary Table S1). Similar to the findings in the SF3B1 wild-type cell line, Shld withdrawal in clones that deplete all copies of SF3B1 strongly inhibited the growth of ESS-1 cells (Fig. 5A, clones #1 and #2), indicating that SF3B1 is also required for the growth of ESS-1 cells. Surprisingly, however, the selective depletion of mutant SF3B1 protein, which was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S4E), did not impact the proliferation of ESS-1 cells (Fig. 5A, clones #3 and #4). By contrast, the selective depletion of the wildtype protein profoundly inhibited cell growth, despite continued expression of mutant SF3B1 protein (Fig. 5A, clones #7, #8, and #9). To exclude the possibility that the dependence on wild-type SF3B1 in this cell line is due to a gene dosage effect, as cells harbor only one mutant and likely two wild-type copies of SF3B1, we investigated the impact of Shld withdrawal on clones that had a DD tag inserted in both the mutant and one wild-type copy of SF3B1, where cells continued to express presumably only one remaining copy of the SF3B1 wild-type protein. Shld withdrawal in these clones also had no discernable growth impact (Fig. 5A, clones #5 and #6), despite having a similar total level of remaining SF3B1 protein compared with clones #7, #8, and #9 (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S4E). Collectively, these findings suggest that the in vitro growth of ESS-1 cells critically depends on the remaining wild-type copies of SF3B1 but not mutant SF3B1. Given these unexpected findings in ESS-1 cells, we wanted to investigate the effects of allele-specific SF3B1 inhibition in an additional cancer cell line model. The uveal melanoma line Mel202 harbors the SF3B1 R625G hotspot mutation, which is recurrently mutated in primary uveal melanoma tumors (27, 28). This mutation has previously been described to correlate with alternative splicing of the genes UQCC and CRNDE in uveal melanoma tumors (33), but a causal relationship between SF3B1 mutations and these alternative splicing patterns has not yet been established. Mel202 cells were found to be expressing one mutant and multiple wild-type alleles of SF3B1. Using the Degron-KI system, we again were able to obtain Mel202 clones that had DDtag insertions in single or multiple alleles of SF3B1. During the clone characterization, we identified clones that exhibited a Figure 3. PIK3CA Degron-KI mirrors the activity of pharmacologic PI3Ka inhibitor.

This mutant knockout clone showed a reversal of the altered splicing pattern in UQCC and CRNDE to that of the SF3B1 wild-type cells (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S9), thus providing a robust readout for the functional inactivation of mutant SF3B1. Indeed, in clones that selectively DD-tag the R625G mutant but not wild-type SF3B1 alleles, Shld withdrawal reversed the altered splicing pattern of UQCC and CRNDE (Fig. 5C), indicating that the Degron-KI system allowed for robust inactivation of mutant SF3B1. By contrast, in clones that selectively DD-tag the wild-type SF3B1 alleles but not the R625G allele, Shld withdrawal did not affect the splicing pattern of UQCC and CRNDE (Fig. 5C). These findings demonstrate that SF3B1 mutations are causally linked to the alternative splicing of UQCC and CRNDE. Next, we wanted to examine the effects of selective SF3B1-mutant depletion on gene expression and alternative splicing at a global, genome-wide level. Analysis of the RNAseq data using CuffDiff (12) showed that selective depletion of the DD-R625G–mutant protein in MEL202 cells had little impact on the global gene expression pattern (Supplementary Fig. S10). By contrast, using MATS (34), we found that selective depletion of the SF3B1 mutant affected the alternative splicing of 138 genes, including several genes that were found to be alternatively spliced in primary uveal melanoma tumors harboring SF3B1 mutations, e.g., ABCC5, SERBP1, SNRPN, DLST, DYNLL1, ENOSF1, SLC3A2, STIM1, TMEM14C (ref. 33; Supplementary Tables S3–S4; Supplementary Fig. S11). Moreover, we found that the majority of alternative splicing events in response to mutant SF3B1 depletion consisted of alternative 30 splice sites, with little impact on 50 splice sites (Supplementary Fig. S12). These findings are consistent with SF3B10 s role as a core component of the U2 snRNP complex that promotes the initial formation of the spliceosome at 30 exon/intron boundaries (35). Together, these findings indicate that SF3B1 mutations alter spliceosome activity that lead to "aberrant" use of alternate 30 splice sites. Despite the efficient reversion of the altered splicing pattern, however, mutant-selective depletion of SF3B1 had no significant impact on in vitro growth in both two-dimensional and 3D tissue culture systems (Fig. 5D and F, clones #1 and #2). By contrast, as was previously observed in ESS-1 cells, the wild-type selective depletion of SF3B1 significantly impaired the growth of MEL202 cells (Fig. 5D and F, clone #4). The results from these two SF3B1- mutant cancer cell line models suggest that the SF3B1-mutant Figure 4. SF3B1 Degron-KI demonstrates that SF3B1 is required for the growth of SF3B1 wild-type cells.

Moreover, the critical dependence on the remaining wild-type copies of SF3B1 indicates that SF3B1 hotspot mutants must be defective in some essential cellular activity that requires compensation by the remaining wild-type protein. Discussion The Degron-KI system described here presents a method for the functional characterization and validation of novel cancer genes, and provides several features that address some shortcomings of current genetic loss-of-function tools. First, in contrast to RNAibased methods, the Degron-KI approach should have minimal off-target effects, as the DD tag should only create fusion genes for the gene of interest. Indeed, a genome-wide survey by RNAseq of several DD-SF3B1–tagged Mel202 clones revealed that DD-tag fusions were only detected at the SF3B1 gene locus (Supplementary Fig. S13). Using RNAseq, we also confirmed that the addition of Shld has minimal to no effects on global gene expression (Supplementary Fig. S10). Moreover, the ability to study each clone in the presence and absence of Shld provides an ideal isogenic setting and a robust control for any potential CRISPRinduced genomic alterations. A potential limitation of the Degron-KI approach is that it only works efficiently when applied as an N-terminal fusion (10, and data not shown) and thus requires that proteins can tolerate N-terminal tagging. While Cterminal degron fusion systems have been described (36, 37), we found that protein depletion was much less effective compared with the DD-Shld system (data not shown). In addition, for some genes the expression level of DD-tagged protein was reduced compared with the untagged protein, possibly due to slight alteration in protein stability (incomplete stabilization through Shld) or translation efficiency (due to the P2A ribosome skipping site). Importantly, however, for 5 of 6 genes that we have tested so far, we found that homozygous DD-tagged clones behaved similarly to the parental cell line, suggesting that in most cases the DD-tagged protein is sufficiently expressed and functional. Further supporting the high reproducibility of the Degron-KI method, our analysis of multiple independent DD-tagged clones revealed similar phenotypic results for each gene studied. A second feature of the Degron-KI approach is that it enables inducible, titratable, and reversible gene depletion. A key requirement for any loss-of-function method is the ability to efficiently inhibit protein function. Although the extent of protein depletion with the Degron-KI system was robust for the proteins tested in our study, it appears to be incomplete in most cases. Therefore, the Degron-KI approach described here will most likely create hypomorphs rather than complete null states. Consistent with this notion, Shld withdrawal in the DDtagged clone led to robust but slightly weaker inhibition of pAKT and cell proliferation in NCIH1048 DD-PIK3CA cells compared with the PI3Ka small-molecule inhibitor BYL719. However, it is important to note that in all cases tested, the extent of protein depletion was sufficient to recapitulate genetic (p53) or pharmacologic (EZH2, PIK3CA) loss-of-function phenotypes, as judged by downstream pathway inhibition and impact on growth (in the case of oncogene dependence). Another important feature of the Degron-KI system is that, in contrast with current genetic tools, it allows for the titration of gene inactivation by varying the dose of Shld. The titration of Shld in DD-PIK3CA lines, for instance, was able to mirror the dose-dependent inhibition of pathway and growth modulation by a pharmacologic PI3Ka inhibitor. Collectively, the reversibility and ability to titrate protein depletion with the Degron-KI system provide a closer surrogate of target modulation by pharmacologic inhibitors. We would like to note that the Degron-KI method is highly efficient and broadly applicable. We were able to recover high proportions of correctly DD-tagged clones for 4 different genes tested across 7 cell line models, including a nonadherent DLBCL cell line that is difficult to transfect. Many cancer cell lines exhibit aneuploidy, which creates a challenge for somatic engineering as many loci will be present at more than two copies. Using CRISPR-based targeting, however, we were able to engineer "homozygously" DD-tagged clones in a single round of transfection even in cell lines that were triploid or tetraploid for the locus of interest. Together with a recent study that developed a similar approach but was restricted to a single gene and a single cell line (38), these findings indicate that the Degron-KI approach should be broadly applicable to many genes and cell line models. Lastly, a key feature of the Degron-KI system is the ability for allele-specific targeting. The application of this technology to the study of the putative oncogene SF3B1 yielded several important insights. SF3B1 mutations cluster at hotspots and are suggestive of gain of function, but their mechanism of action and oncogene dependence remained unclear. Although previous studies demonstrated a correlation between SF3B1 mutation and aberrant splicing, allele-specific targeting enabled us to provide the first demonstration that this altered splicing pattern can be directly reversed by inhibition of the mutant but not the wild-type protein. Our data indicate that SF3B1 mutations alter spliceosome activity, leading to aberrant use of alternate 30 splice sites. Moreover, allelespecific targeting allowed us to separate the impact on alternative splicing of the mutant protein from the cell-essential spliceosome function performed by the wild-type SF3B1 protein. Surprisingly, the reversal of aberrant splicing in response to SF3B1-mutant– specific inhibition did not translate to growth-inhibitory effects in the two SF3B1-mutant cancer models tested. Perhaps even more unexpected, SF3B1-mutated cells are critically dependent on the function of the remaining wild-type SF3B1 allele(s), and sole expression of mutant SF3B1 is not sufficient to maintain in vitro growth. Together, these findings indicate that the splicing alterations induced by SF3B1 mutations are not required for in vitro cancer proliferation. The dependence on the wild-type SF3B1 allele suggests that the SF3B1 mutations have characteristics of a loss-of-function allele with respect to in vitro growth, potentially explaining why SF3B1 mutations are always heterozygous, as homozygous alterations may not be compatible with cell growth. It is possible that SF3B1-mutant function is only required for in vivo growth or other aspects of tumorigenesis, or that growth dependence was lost with repeated passaging in tissue culture. Alternatively, SF3B1 mutations may present a predisposing or initiating event that is not required for continued cancer growth. Despite the potential caveats outlined above, the findings described raise caution as to whether the selective targeting of SF3B1-mutant protein will yield robust antitumor effects. Moreover, the finding that SF3B1 appears to also be essential in cells lacking oncogenic SF3B1 alterations raises potential concerns regarding the therapeutic index for pan-SF3B1 inhibitors. As illustrated by the case of SF3B1, the Degron-KI approach described here presents a powerful tool to assess dominant and Zhou et al. 1956 Cancer Res; 75(10) May 15, 2015 Cancer Research Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 27, 2017. © 2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

Graphical Abstract Image for unlabelled figure Figure options  Introduction RNA splicing, a highly regulated molecular event orchestrated by the spliceosome, involves the removal of intronic sequences from pre-mRNA and the ligation of exons to generate mature mRNA (Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009). This process can result in multiple mRNAs being produced from a single gene providing increased protein diversity in cells. Dysregulation of RNA splicing has been identified as a causative defect in several diseases (Dehm, 2013 ;  Singh and Cooper, 2012). Furthermore, dysregulated alternative splicing has been proposed to play an important role in tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy; however, in many cases, the molecular consequences of dysregulated splicing in cancer have remained largely elusive (Zhang and Manley, 2013). Recently, recurrent heterozygous mutations were identified in components of the spliceosome in various tumor types suggesting that somatic mutations in spliceosome genes play an important role in cancer (Yoshida and Ogawa, 2014). SF3B1 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene with particular enrichment in diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, uveal melanoma (UVM), skin melanoma (SKCM), and breast (BRCA) and pancreatic cancers ( Biankin et al., 2012; Ellis et al., 2012; Harbour et al., 2013; Kong et al., 2014; Landau et al., 2013; Malcovati et al., 2015 ;  Yoshida et al., 2011). Based on the high frequency of SF3B1 mutations and the key role in splicing of this protein, we sought to study the molecular and functional consequences of SF3B1 hotspot mutations on RNA splicing in cell lines and patient samples.  Splicing takes place after the recognition of consensus sequences near the 5′ and 3′ ends of introns, known as 5′ and 3′ splice sites (ss), by the splicing machinery. U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) recognizes the 5′ ss, whereas U2 snRNP is directed to the appropriate 3′ ss by short, conserved pre-mRNA sequences, including a branch point sequence (BPS), the polypyrimidine (Py) tract, and the AG dinucleotide at the intron-exon junction. Prior to U2 snRNP recruitment, SF1 recognizes the BPS, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) large subunit (U2AF2) recognizes the Py tract, and U2AF small subunit (U2AF1) recognizes the AG dinucleotide. Subsequently, the U2 snRNP replaces SF1 in an ATP-dependent process that facilitates protein and RNA rearrangements. In particular, the N terminus of SF3B1, a U2 snRNP component, has been shown to bind with U2AF2, whereas the SF3B1 C terminus along with another U2 snRNP component, p14, interacts with the BPS and nearby pre-mRNA sequences (Gozani et al., 1998). In addition, U2 snRNP and pre-mRNA complex is stabilized by a base-paired duplex between the U2 snRNA and the BPS. The subsequent binding of U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP induces structural rearrangements that lead to activation of two catalytic steps that generate the lariat intermediate and subsequent final exon-exon product (Horowitz, 2012; Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009).  The recurrent hotspot mutations in SF3B1 are found exclusively in the C-terminal HEAT domains (residues 622–781; Figure S1A). Though there has been lack of structural information on how SF3B1 interacts with pre-mRNA, previous cryo-electron microscopy studies suggest that SF3B1 may undergo a conformational change to a more open form that enables mRNA binding and BPS recognition by the U2 snRNP (Golas et al., 2003). Although it was previously reported by several groups that SF3B1 mutant-positive cancers are associated with aberrant splicing (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013), here, we show that SF3B1 hotspot mutations (SF3B1MUT) result in neomorphic activity causing aberrant splicing. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ ss selection through the use of a branch point (BP) different from the BP utilized by SF3B1 wild-type (SF3B1WT) and that SF3B1MUT still requires the canonical Py tract for the formation of the active spliceosome to induce aberrant splicing. We predict that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced mRNAs are subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that multiple aberrant transcripts are degraded, resulting in downregulation of the associated canonical protein in cell line models and patient samples. These insights into the splicing aberrations induced by SF3B1MUT will enable discovery of downstream consequences that contribute to neoplasms and the discovery of targeted therapeutic approaches for SF3B1MUT cancers.  Results SF3B1MUT Tumor-Specific Splicing Defects  To provide a more complete understanding of the splicing aberrations observed in SF3B1MUT cancers, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from different tumor types were analyzed using a bioinformatic pipeline that we developed in order to quantify exon-exon junctions without the need of predetermined alternative splicing models or annotated splice junctions. The analysis pipeline was applied to CLL patient samples (7 SF3B1MUT and 6 SF3B1WT) and a number of samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas: luminal A primary BRCA (7 SF3B1K700E and 14 SF3B1WT), SKCM (3 SF3B1MUT and 12 SF3B1WT), and UVM (18 SF3B1MUT and 18 SF3B1WT) (Table S1). This analysis revealed 895 aberrant splice junctions to be significantly upregulated in SF3B1MUT compared to SF3B1WT of which 534 events (∼60%) were unique as they had not been previously annotated in major transcriptome databases. The majority of aberrant splicing events observed were aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures 1A and S1B; Table S2), consistent with previous observations (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013).

Box plots and whiskers are represented as per the Tukey method. See also Figure S1 and Tables S2 and S3. Figure options Unsupervised clustering was applied to the identified aberrant junctions and it led to clustering of SF3B1MUT samples distinct from the cluster of SF3B1WT samples (Figure 1B), with the exception of two SF3B1MUT samples (TCGA-D8-A1JH and TCGA-ER-A19S) that clustered with the SF3B1WT samples. This was likely driven by low mutant allele fractions (7% and 14%, respectively) when compared with a range of 25%–52% for other samples (Figure 1B; Table S2). Moreover, samples with SF3B1MUT clustered within each tumor type (BRCA, SKCM, UVM, and CLL), each showing a set of unique aberrantly spliced junctions (Figures 1B and S1C). A set of “common” events (i.e., events found in all tumor types) were observed, consistent with a small overlap of splicing abnormalities found in CLL and UVM described in two previous reports (Furney et al., 2013). The pattern of tumor-specific splicing in BRCA and CLL could, at least in part, be explained by the increased expression of the genes that are aberrantly spliced in these tumor types compared to the other diseases (p = 7.5022 × 10−05 and p = 1.0078 × 10−36, respectively); however, the same was not observed for SKCM and UVM (Figure 1C; Table S3). This suggests that additional mechanisms, such as tissue-specific splicing regulation, might contribute to these patterns.  Using the aberrant junctions identified in the previous analysis, we extended the clustering analysis to include 14 MDS RARS samples (12 SF3B1MUT) and an additional 19 samples from TCGA with miscellaneous SF3B1 mutations (Table S1). For the MDS samples, relatively low sequencing depth and inclusion of just two SF3B1WT samples precluded their use for the discovery of MDS-specific aberrant junctions. While all SF3B1MUT MDS patients and three BRCA patients (p.N626D, p.D781E, and p.K666E) clustered with the original SF3B1MUT sample set, 16 SF3B1 mutant patients clustered with SF3B1WT samples (Figure S1D). These patient samples carried mutations in SF3B1 (“Non-hotspot” in Figure S1D and Table S1) that are not co-localized with the hotspot mutations in the HEAT domain. These analyses strongly suggest a convergence of mechanism and downstream splicing effects induced by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1 Mutations Induce Aberrant mRNA Splicing in Human and Mouse Cells  To study SF3B1MUT in vitro, a pancreatic cancer cell line carrying endogenous SF3B1 mutations (Panc05.04: p.Q699H and p.K700E) was utilized. In addition, the p.K700E, p.K666N, or p.H662Q mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E, Nalm-6 SF3B1K666N, Nalm-6 SF3B1H662Q) or a synonymous mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700K, referred as SF3B1WT) was introduced by AAV-mediated homology to the Nalm-6 pre-B cell line to produce isogenic matched cell lines. Unsupervised clustering of these cell lines and a panel of several SF3B1WT pancreatic cancer cell lines using the aberrant splice junctions identified in patient samples resulted in clear segregation of SF3B1MUT cell lines from SF3B1WT cells (Figure 2A). A similar increase in aberrant splice junctions observed in RNA-seq data analysis was confirmed in Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells using a Nanostring assay developed to quantify aberrant splice junctions (Figure S2A). Panc05.04 cells carry the hotspot mutation p.K700E and a mutation at position 699 (p.Q699H) that is not observed in patient samples. When the p.Q699H and p.K700E were expressed alone or in combination in 293FT cells, only cells expressing p.K700E and p.Q699H/p.K700E induced aberrant splicing indicating that p.Q699H does not appear to affect this aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures S2B and S2C). These data confirm that Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1MUT cell lines are representative models to study the splicing functional activity of SF3B1MUT in vitro.

Data are represented as mean of three biological replicates. Data are presented in box plots as boxes in the first and third quartiles, midline as the median, and whiskers extending to the range excluding outliers. See also Figure S2. Figure options To confirm that additional cancer-associated SF3B1 hotspot mutations induced aberrant splicing, we expressed various mxSF3B1MUT, mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R in 293FT cells (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for a description of mxSF3B1; Figure S2D) and analyzed splicing aberrations by Nanostring. The p.K700R mutation served as a negative control as it doesn’t introduce a major change in charge or size of the amino acid and is not disease associated. All SF3B1MUT tested demonstrated the same usage of aberrant splice sites observed in endogenous and engineered cell lines; however, the SF3B1K700R or SF3B1WT did not show these splicing changes (Figure 2B). Moreover, the expression of any of the SF3B1 constructs did not change the overall expression (sum of aberrant and canonical) of affected genes (Figure 2B). To further confirm the correlation between expression of SF3B1 p.K700E mutation and aberrant splicing, tetracycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to selectively knockdown (KD) the SF3B1MUT or SF3B1WT allele in Panc05.04 and Panc10.05 (SF3B1MUT and SF3B1WT cells). After confirmation of KD efficiency (Figures S2E–S2H), RNA isolated from treated cells was analyzed by Nanostring. Depletion of the SF3B1MUT allele in Panc05.04 resulted in downregulation of aberrant splice isoforms, whereas an accumulation of aberrant splice isoforms was observed with selective SF3B1WT allele depletion (Figures 2C and 2D), indicating that SF3B1MUT was responsible for the appearance of aberrant splicing. These results were also supported by the expression of a pan shRNA or depletion of SF3B1WT in the Panc10.05 where no effect on aberrant splicing was observed (Figures 2C and 2D). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT acquires a neomorphic function and may also lose wild-type splicing activity. This observation was also supported by the recent paper by Zhou et al. proposing that in a different SF3B1 mutant cell line (ESS1) wild-type SF3B1 was required for survival (Zhou et al., 2015).  SF3B1MUT Recognizes a Cryptic 3′ AG with a Short and Weak Py Tract  The most common splicing abnormality observed in SF3B1MUT cells was the usage of an aberrant 3′ ss. To understand the sequence features and the mechanism by which mutant SF3B1 would induce aberrant splicing, computational analysis of SF3B1MUT patient data and minigene assay validation methods were utilized. First, an enrichment of the cryptic AGs was determined to be located between −15 and −24 nt upstream of the canonical 3′ ss in SF3B1MUT patient samples (Figure 3A). In contrast, the first AG (but not GAG) upstream of a canonical AG in RefSeq showed a much lower density in this region and a wider distribution. Interestingly, the motif sequences associated with the cryptic and canonical AGs showed several different features. Upstream of the canonical AGs, a clear enrichment of pyrimidines was observed in agreement with the presence of a Py tract, whereas the cryptic AGs were associated with a short and weak Py tract and an enrichment of adenines (A) that are possibly important for BPS selection. In contrast, no clear features were associated with the first upstream AGs in RefSeq (Figures 3B and S3). Interestingly, similar features, such as the position of cryptic AG between −15 and −24, the presence of a short and weak Py tract, and an enrichment of As were observed in aberrant 3′ spliced junctions detected in NIH 3T3 mouse cells overexpressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures S4A–S4C). While similar features associated with aberrant splice junction usage were observed in mxSF3B1K700E mouse cells, the overlap of affected junctions observed in human cells was low due to low sequence similarity of introns between species (Figure S4D; Table S4). An exception was observed for the UXS1 gene for which the junction between exon 2 and exon 3 is conserved among different species ( Figure S4E). These data strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant splicing in the presence of competing 3′ ss via a sequence-dependent feature located within the intron and preferentially recognizes cryptic splice sites with weaker Py tract in close proximity to an enrichment of As.

Shown here is a representative ethidium-bromide-stained 2.5% agarose gel of the indicated RT-PCR reactions of mRNA isolated from transfected cells. See also Figures S4 and S5 and Table S4. Figure options To confirm the importance of these specific sequence features, we selected the exon 9/exon 10 junction in ZDHHC16 to develop a minigene as it was observed to be aberrantly spliced among all the SF3B1 hotspot mutant samples analyzed. In addition, several alterations in the cryptic 3′ ss, the length/strength of the Py tracts, and the potential BPS were tested ( Figure S5A). Splicing was assessed by RT-PCR using cDNA prepared from 293FT cells co-transfected with ZDHHC16 minigene and mxSF3B1 plasmid. As expected, when the ZDHHC16 exon 9, intron 9 and exon 10 (E9-I9-E10) minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, only canonical splicing was observed, whereas in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E and all the other hotspot mutations, both canonical and aberrant splicing was detected (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 4 and 5; Figure S5B). Interestingly, once the cryptic AG was removed (E9-I9NoAG-E10), aberrant splicing was not observed even in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that the cryptic AG is necessary for aberrant splicing. To understand whether exonic sequences play a role in aberrant splicing, we looked at the preceding junction in ZDHHC16 (E8-I8-E9). As expected, no aberrant splicing was observed when this minigene was co-transfected with any of the mxSF3B1 constructs (Figure 3D, lanes 10 and 11). Canonical and aberrant splicing was detected when intron 8 between exon 8 and 9 was replaced with intron 9 (E8-I9-E9) in the ZDHHC16 minigene and co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, but not when co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R (Figure 3D, lanes 12 and 13). These results agree with the computational analysis suggesting that the cryptic AG is necessary and the intronic features are sufficient to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  Identification of the 3′ ss occurs during early assembly of the spliceosome, in particular when the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex recognizes the Py tract and AG, and then again when the AG is recognized during the second step of splicing (Horowitz, 2012). To understand if the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is sufficient to recruit the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex, the length/strength of the canonical Py tract was reduced from 19 nt to 10, 6, and 2 nt (PyT 10n, PyT 6n, and PyT 2n, respectively) or the weak and short cryptic Py tract was replaced with a strong Py tract (SELEX) (Figure S5A) (Lim et al., 2011). When the minigene PyT 2n (or PyT 10n and PyT 6n, in Figure S5C) was co-transfected with the mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, the splicing event occurred with selection of a new cryptic 3′ ss within exon 10 positioned 54 nt downstream of the canonical 3′ ss (sequencing data not shown), suggesting that the PyT 2n was not recognized by U2AF complex (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15; Figure S5C). This is in agreement with previous reports suggesting that Py tract length and strength are necessary for the recruitment of U2AF2/U2AF1 to guide splicing to occur at that position (Coolidge et al., 1997). Surprisingly, when the same minigenes were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, similar results were observed and splicing occurred within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15), suggesting that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is not sufficient to recruit the U2AF complex and that the cryptic AG requires the downstream canonical Py tract to induce aberrant splicing. The nucleotide base upstream of the AG dinucleotide has been reported to be critical for U2AF1 interaction in early recognition of 3′ ss and is usually a T/C in consensus sequences (Ilagan et al., 2015). Hence, introduction of a G upstream of the canonical or cryptic AG (−3 T > G or −24 C > G) would potentially abolish their use as a 3′ ss, respectively. When −3 T > G minigene was co-transfected with either mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E constructs, splicing was observed within exon 10, similar to PyT 2n, suggesting again that the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex needs to be recruited at the canonical AG during first step of splicing to allow usage of the cryptic AG by SF3B1MUT (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 16 and 17). Interestingly, when −24 C > G minigene was used, only canonical splicing was observed, even after mxSF3B1K700E expression (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 8 and 9). These data suggest that the −3 position relative to cryptic AG is also important when the cryptic 3′ ss is recognized during the second transesterification reaction of splicing. Moreover, when the short and weak cryptic Py tract was replaced with a SELEX Py tract, the cryptic AG was used as the preferred 3′ ss by cells expressing both mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 18 and 19). Taken together, these data support the notion that the sequence features required by SF3B1MUT-containing U2 snRNP complex are located within the intron and that the cryptic AG and the downstream canonical Py tract are required to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1MUT Utilizes a Different BPS  The computational analysis of motifs near the 3′ ss showed an enrichment of As upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse mutant SF3B1 cells, suggesting the importance of this sequence for the SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 complex. DeBoever and colleagues suggested that these were the BPSs for the mutant and wild-type SF3B1 complexes using a BPS prediction algorithm (DeBoever et al., 2015). Instead, we used the recently mapped BPS data using K562 SF3B1WT cells and overlaid these data with introns in which the aberrant splice junctions were observed in SF3B1MUT cells (Mercer et al., 2015). A total of 151 BPs were mapped among 93 introns; 60 introns have only one identified BP, and another 33 introns contain multiple reported BPs. The distribution of these BPs with respect to the cryptic AG indicated that the majority of BPs overlapped with the A of the cryptic AG or were in close proximity (between 1, cryptic A and −5), but did not coincide with the enrichment of As observed in the motif analysis (Figure 4A). The enrichment of As was observed between −8 and −18 nt upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse cells expressing mutant SF3B1 (Figures 4B and S4C). This suggests that these As could play an important role for SF3B1MUT function. To test this hypothesis, the 3 As located between −33 and −35 were mutated to Gs in the ZDHHC16 minigene (−33 to −35 AAA > GGG; Figure 4C and S5A). When this minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT and mxSF3B1K700R, canonical splicing was observed, suggesting that these As are not part of the BPS for wild-type U2 complex (Figure 4D, lanes 11 and 12). Instead, when the cells were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, canonical splicing was observed without any aberrant splicing, indicating that the three As are probably part of the BPS used by the U2 mutant complex (Figure 4D, lane 12). To identify the BPS used by the U2 wild-type complex, the A at position −26 and −30 alone or together were mutated to G (−26 A > G, −30 A > G and −26, −30 AA > GG; Figure 4C). When the A at position −26 alone or both −26 and −30 were mutated to G and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, splicing was observed within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10), suggesting that this is likely the BPS for SF3B1WT, but not for SF3B1K700E, as canonical and aberrant splicing was observed in these conditions (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10). Interestingly, when the minigene with the A at position −30 alone was mutated to G (Figure 4C and S5A) and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R splicing was observed mostly within exon 10 and when co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, only aberrant splicing was observed (Figure 4D, lanes 7 and 8). As expected, when all the As were mutated to Gs (all A > G, Figures 4C and S5A), each mxSF3B1 construct spliced within exon 10 (Figure 4D, lanes 13 and 14). Additionally, this outcome was confirmed by mapping the two different BPs using nested PCR analysis and sequencing of endogenous ZDHHC16 intron 9 lariat in K562 isogenic cells ( Figure 4E). Unlike in SF3B1WT cells, we observed at least two major templates with different sequences in the SF3B1K700E cells due to a mixed population of SF3B1WT and SF3B1MUT proteins. Through analysis and matching of expected transcript sequences using Mutation Surveyor, we found that −34 A and −30 A were the BPs used for SF3B1K700E and SF3B1WT, respectively. To extend our observation, we also mapped BPs in four additional genes that are aberrantly spliced in presence of SF3B1K700E: TMEM14C (intron 1), SEPT6 (intron 9), DLST (intron 5), and DIP2A (intron 23) ( Table S5). These results prove that the SF3B1 wild-type and mutant-containing U2 complexes are able to use two different BPs.  SF3B1MUT Uses a Different BPS than SF3B1WT(A) Relative positions of mapped BP ...

(E) Endogenous ZDHHC16 intron 9 lariat sequencing analysis using nested PCR products of isolated RNA from K562 SF3B1K700E or SF3B1WT isogenic cells. See also Figure S5 and Table S5. Figure options Aberrant Transcripts Generated by SF3B1MUT Are Subjected to NMD  Erroneous or aberrant mRNAs that contain a premature termination codon are subjected to NMD to prevent potential deleterious effects of their translation to proteins (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Computational analysis revealed that the majority of cryptic AGs were located upstream of canonical 3′ ss at nucleotide distances that were not multiples of 3 (Figure 5A). This result suggested that the aberrant transcripts would have a higher probability to be out of frame and therefore degraded by NMD. To confirm that predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts were degraded by the NMD pathway, RNA-seq was performed on Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells treated with cycloheximide, a translation inhibitor known to inhibit NMD (Singh et al., 2012). Bioinformatic prediction analysis revealed that 44% of all aberrant mRNAs identified in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cell lines would result in an NMD-sensitive transcript (Rivas et al., 2015) (Figure 5B; Tables S6 and S7). RNA-seq analysis from Nalm-6 isogenic cells demonstrated that NMD-sensitive genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E than Nalm-6 SF3B1WT (p = 1.06 × 10−12), whereas predicted NMD-insensitive genes were expressed at similar levels (Figure 5C). RNA-seq analysis identified 41 predicted NMD-sensitive genes to be both downregulated in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E and to have increased abundance following cycloheximide treatment (Figure 5D; Table S6), suggesting that these aberrant transcripts were degraded by the NMD. In addition, to evaluate if this would result in downregulation of the associated canonical protein, stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) with subsequent mass spectrometry was used to quantify protein levels in Nalm-6 isogenic lines (Oda et al., 1999)· Eleven predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts for which peptides could be detected in Nalm-6 SF3B1WT were selected for evaluation, and ten were found to have decreased peptide counts by at least 2- to 8-fold (e.g., ABCB7, AKAP8L; Figure 6A). Decreased expression of canonical proteins was confirmed by western blot analysis using available antibodies, such as MZB1, PHGDH, and SEPT6 (Figure 6B). Among the downregulated proteins in the SILAC experiment were two proteins of particular interest: MZB1 and ABCB7. MZB1 is a B cell-specific and ER-localized protein implicated in antibody secretion and integrin-mediated cell adhesion (van Anken et al., 2009). As shown in Figure 6C, MZB1 was aberrantly spliced in SF3B1K700E cells and the canonical isoform was clearly downregulated at transcript and protein level (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6D). As shown in Figure 6E, clear downregulation of canonical MZB1 protein level was also observed in four out of five CLL patients with SF3B1MUT, but not in SF3B1WT samples. The result for patient 8 could be explained by the low allele fraction for Y623C (10%), and this was associated with undetectable aberrant splicing for ZDHHC16 and no change in canonical MZB1 when compared with one of the SF3B1WT patients (Figure S6). ABCB7 is a mediator of iron accumulation and erythroid growth and has been reported to be downregulated specifically in an MDS subtype characterized by refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (Boultwood et al., 2008). Interestingly, SF3B1 mutations have been found at a frequency of 80%–90% in RARS, but not in other MDS subtypes (Papaemmanuil et al., 2011). In addition, a partial loss-of-function mutation in ABCB7 has been identified in X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia demonstrating an iron-overload phenotype in cells with defective ABCB7 (Allikmets et al., 1999). We identified that ABCB7 is aberrantly spliced in SF3B1 mutant cells (Figure 6F) and demonstrated that the aberrant transcript is subject to NMD, causing downregulation of the canonical transcript and protein (Figures 6A and 6D). Therefore, aberrant splicing and subsequent NMD of ABCB7 likely explains the association between ABCB7 downregulation observed in RARS and the presence of SF3B1 mutants. Taken together, these data suggest that SF3B1MUT might contribute to the phenotypes observed in diseases by inducing the generation of NMD-sensitive transcripts through aberrant splicing and to a subsequent reduction in the levels of the corresponding proteins.  44% of All Aberrantly Spliced Genes Are Putative Targets of NMD(A) Frequency of ...

See also Figure S6. Figure options Discussion In the current study, we describe the mechanism by which SF3B1 hotspot mutations induce aberrant splicing and the fate of resulting NMD-sensitive aberrant mRNAs in several cancer types. These mutations are associated with the expression of hundreds of aberrantly spliced junctions, mostly by utilizing a cryptic AG. While some aberrant junctions are common across different cancer types, others are tumor specific, which in some cases is a consequence of tissue-specific gene expression; however, additional factors likely contribute to these differences. Interestingly, aberrant splicing was observed only in patients carrying hotspot mutations located in the C-terminal HEAT domains, but not in samples from “non-hotspot” patients, as they clustered with the SF3B1WT patients in aberrant junction usage comparisons. The majority of these non-hotspot mutations are located away from the HEAT repeat domains, which suggests that they may have different effects on cancer cells or simply are passenger mutations, and are not the focus of the present study. We calculated an electrostatic potential map based on a homology model of SF3B1WT with importin-β and observed that all hotspot mutations are co-localized in a limited, positively charged region even though they are distributed across five different HEAT domains (Figure 7A). Furthermore, while there are various amino acid substitutions at the hotspots that result in change of size and/or polarity of side chains, our data suggest the functional consequences on splicing for these changes are similar. We show that hotspot SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ splicing in junctions associated with specific sequence features: an enrichment of As followed by a short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG located −15 to −24 nt from the canonical 3′ ss.

The color scheme of the electric potential surface is +10 V (blue) and −10 V (red). The position of the hotspot mutations located in the five HEAT repeat domains (highlighted in yellow) is represented in the inset. (B and C) Schematic representation of splicing in SF3B1WT (B) and SF3B1MUT (C) cells and molecular consequences of transcripts is also shown. Figure options Based on computational analysis, it was recently suggested that SF3B1 mutations cause a change in the size of the sterically protected region downstream of the BP without any altered BP recognition allowing the utilization of the cryptic AG (DeBoever et al., 2015). It was also suggested that SF3B1 mutations could alter interactions with U2AF2, affecting the ability to recognize the canonical 3′ ss and leading to cryptic 3′ ss selection. In contrast, we provide experimental evidence that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is insufficient for the recruitment of the U2AF complex and that the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss, and thereby interaction with U2AF2 is required to observe aberrant splicing as well. In addition, we have demonstrated that the SF3B1MUT U2 complex utilizes a BP that is different from the one used by the wild-type U2 complex (proposed model, Figures 7B and 7C). Based on these data and the restricted localization of the hotspot mutations, we hypothesize that SF3B1MUT interacts differently with the pre-mRNA or splicing factors that are important for the recognition of AG during the second step of splicing. The close proximity of the two mapped BPs for ZDHHC16 (−30A for SF3B1WT and −34A for SF3B1MUT) reported here (Figure 4E) and the published data on the crosslinking of SF3B1 to bases flanking the BPS (Gozani et al., 1998) would suggest a competition between the SF3B1WT- and SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 snRNP complexes to select the canonical or cryptic AG for splicing, respectively. The mechanism by which SF3B1MUT favors selection of a different BP can only be speculated at this point. Based on our data and a previous study investigating spliceostatin A’s mechanism of action (Corrionero et al., 2011), there are at least two hypotheses: the selection of the new BP is guided by SF3B1MUT through enhanced direct interactions with specific nucleotides flanking the new BPS compensating for reduced base pairing with U2 snRNA or by the base pairing of U2 snRNA with the new/suboptimal BPS compensating for impaired interactions of SF3B1MUT across the canonical BPS.  Although SF3B1MUT does not seem to affect the pre-assembly of U2 snRNP (preliminary data not shown), it is possible that the interactions with splicing factors involved in selection of an alternative AG in the second step of splicing are impaired. Previously, it has been reported that the second step splicing factor, Slu7, is required for correct 3′ ss selection (Chua and Reed, 1999a ;  Chua and Reed, 1999b). Similar to U2AF1, Slu7 harbors a Zn knuckle domain, and it is conceivable that it directly interacts with AG during the second step of splicing. As observed in the case of SF3B1MUT, depletion of Slu7 results in selection of a cryptic AG closer to the BPS. This suggests that SF3B1 hotspot mutations may impair the recruitment of Slu7 to the catalytic core. Additionally, it has been reported that splicing factor SPF45 (hSPF45 is RBM17) is involved in recognition and activation of an alternative AG upstream of the canonical 3′ ss. It has been suggested that SPF45 directly or indirectly binds to the upstream alternative AG with the help of SF3B1 and promotes its utilization during the second catalytic step (Corsini et al., 2007 ;  Lallena et al., 2002). Interestingly, as observed in the present study for SF3B1MUT, SPF45 also depends on the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss to splice at the alternative AG. Since SF3B1MUT binds at a different BPS, it can be speculated that the recruited SPF45 can access the cryptic AG which is otherwise prevented due to the steric hindrance by SF3B1WT. Taken together, the SF3B1 hotspot mutations could be facilitating SPF45 activity and/or abrogating Slu7 activity for selection of the aberrant AG, thereby providing an unanticipated mechanism for regulation of splice site utilization.  Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is a known cellular mechanism that adds complexity and flexibility in gene expression to induce stage-specific patterns not only by inducing expression of a particular isoform but also by engaging NMD to downregulate gene expression (Ge and Porse, 2014 ;  Kalyna et al., 2012). Here, we predicted that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced transcripts in SF3B1MUT cells are NMD sensitive, and we have demonstrated that the associated canonical isoforms are downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels. The downregulation of a large number of genes induced by this “spliceosome sickness” could be the cause of impaired cell functions that contribute to cancer phenotypes and potentially create dependency on essential genes or pathways for survival. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency is a proposed mechanism for disease pathogenesis in MDS, where chromosome 5q is deleted and decreased expression of genes located on the remaining chromosome is observed (e.g., RPS14 and CSKN1A1; Ebert et al., 2008 ;  Schneider et al., 2014). It is plausible that SF3B1 mutations contribute to MDS in a similar fashion by downregulating expression of certain genes resulting in a non-classical path to haploinsufficiency. In addition to the downregulation of canonical proteins, it is also possible that NMD-insensitive aberrant transcripts are translated into aberrant proteins that have altered function. Proteomic analysis of isogenic SF3B1MUT cells did not reveal the presence of aberrant proteins (data not shown), but this may be due to limitations of assay sensitivity, and additional targeted SILAC or deep RNA sequencing of active ribosome fractions may have the required sensitivity to detect such proteins. Recently, several groups reported the molecular consequences and phenotypic effects of other spliceosome mutations, such as U2AF1 and the exonic splicing enhancer binding serine/arginine-rich protein SRSF2 ( Ilagan et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015 ;  Shirai et al., 2015). Though there are some overlaps in genes differentially spliced in tissues affected by each spliceosome mutation, we see only minimal overlaps in predicted NMD targets (Figure S7). However, mutations in all three splicing factors are observed in MDS and are mutually exclusive, suggesting that some of the downstream effects might be common. Thus, while not explored in this study, it is likely that SF3B1 mutations result in defects in hematopoiesis, as has been observed in animal models of SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations. Additional work is ongoing to define the downstream splicing abnormalities that drive the phenotypic effects of spliceosome mutations. Finally, it is also plausible that mutations in SF3B1 impact other proposed splicing regulators (e.g., chromatin, histone modifications), and these should be the subject of future study ( de Almeida et al., 2011; Kfir et al., 2015 ;  Khan et al., 2013).  In summary, computational and experimental approaches were used to demonstrate that SF3B1MUT utilizes a different BP to induce aberrant splicing across multiple cancer types. These insights describe a neomorphic activity for SF3B1 mutations that causes downregulation of canonical protein expression. Furthermore, these studies provide a foundation for the potential discovery of targeted approaches for the treatment of patients carrying SF3B1 hotspot mutations.  
133||The RNA maturation is an important and complex biological process. It requires several small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that comprise the two forms of spliceosomes. The major form of spliceosome (U2-type) is composed of U1, U2, U4/6 and U5 snRNPs, and catalyzes most splicing events in metazoans.1  Mutations of genes, such as SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent SF1, SF3A1, U2AF2 or PRPF40B, encoding spliceosome compounds have been found to occur at high frequencies in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).2, 3, 4 Subsequently, SF3B1 mutations were also found in solid tumors such as endometrial, lung, bladder, pancreatic and breast carcinomas and cutaneous melanomas.5 We and others also reported that 15–20% of uveal melanoma (UM) carry SF3B1 mutations.6, 7, 8 SF3B1 (splicing factor 3 B subunit 1, also named SF3B155) is a central compound the U2 snRNP complex in direct contact with the branch site of the pre-mRNA. SF3B1 contains 22 HEAT repeats (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, Targets of rapamycin 1). Major hotspots of missense mutations of SF3B1 target one of the HEAT repeats at positions R625, K666 and K700, with variability according to diseases, R625 and K700 mutations being the most prevalent in UM and hematologic disorders, respectively. Prognosis value of these mutations vary according to diseases, SF3B1 mutations are associated with poor outcomes in CLL and favorable outcomes in UM.9 SF3B1 mutations are especially associated with the refractory anemia with excess of ring sideroblasts (RARS), a mild form of MDS with little impact on patient’s survival. Consequences of these mutations on splicing are less clear. Aberrant splicing associated with SF3B1 was reported by two landmark publications.2, 3 However, little overlap was found between MDS and CLL. Furthermore, Harbour et al.6 found no splicing effect of SF3B1 mutations in a series of UM patients analyzed by RNA-seq. By combining exon array and RNA-seq analyzes, we recently reported alternative transcripts of eight genes statistically associated with SF3B1 R625 mutations and linked to various RNA processing mechanisms: alternative terminal exons (UQCC, ADAM12, GAS8), alternative 3′ acceptor splice sites (CRNDE, ANKHD1), alternative cassette exons (GUSBP1), alternative first exon (F8) and intron retention (ABCC5).7  Five of these differential splicing events (CRNDE, GUSBP11, UQCC, ABCC5 and ANKHD1) were most consistently associated with the SF3B1-mutated status. Here we explored whether this splicing signature was also associated with SF3B1 mutations in malignancies other than UM, namely in MDS and CLL.  Series of CLL (26 cases), MDS of various subtypes (48 cases) and UM (87 cases) were assembled. These samples were genotyped for the recurrent mutated genes of the spliceosome, and biological and clinical data were obtained (see Supplementary Table for sample characteristics). After RNA extraction and reverse transcription, samples were analyzed for the two splice forms of UQCC, CRNDE, ANKHD1, GUSBP1 and ABCC5 by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) as described previously.7 CRNDE was poorly expressed in CLL, below the detection sensitivity of the RT-QPCR in most cases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied on the splicing ratio of the five expressed genes obtained for the series of MDS and CLL data, as well as with that of the series of UM previously reported.7 Whereas no disease aggregation was observed in the clustering, all SF3B1-mutated samples clustered in a single branch (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table for complete sample status). More specifically, this group of samples included 8 CLL SF3B1-mutated samples (K700E (6), K666T (1) and G742D (1)), 24 MDS SF3B1-mutated sample cases (K700E (14), H622Q (4), D781G (2), R625L/H/D/C (4)) and 19 SF3B1-mutated UM samples (R625H/C/L/P (16), K666M/T (2), K700E (1)). As expected, most SF3B1-mutated MDS were classified as RARS or refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (16 and 4, respectively out of 23 cases). No SF3B1-mutated samples were misclassified, except one MDS sample, MDS44 and one UM case, UM48, with low but detectable frequencies of mutated SF3B1 allele, which segregated with wild-type cases. Five cases without detected splicesome mutations (one MDS, two UM and two CLL) clustered in this branch corresponding to the mutated samples. The three SRSF2-mutated MDS cases, bearing the P95H hotspot mutation, segregated in the second branch with the wild-type samples, suggesting that this mutant-splicing factor differently affects the splicing process than the SF3B1 mutants. Two MDS samples bearing ZRSR2 missense mutations of unknown functional consequences (K413E and V304M) segregated each in a different branch.  Figure 1.

An unsupervised hierarchical clustering and a heatmap are performed using the difference in Ct (threshold cycle) between the two splicing forms expression for the five genes, measured by RT-QPCR for a series of 161 tumor samples representing 3 pathologies: uveal melanoma (UM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Data were normalized on mean and standard deviation within each pathology and research center. Clustering was performed based on Euclidian distance by Ward’s method. Splicing status is indicated by color code, representing: WT, wild-type status of the tested spliceosome compounds; SF3B1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2, mutated status of these genes, respectively. NA, not available.  Full figure and legend (124K)  Several conclusions could be drawn from these results. First, it is the first time that consistent splicing abnormalities are associated with SF3B1 mutations. The fact that the same splicing pattern is observed in tumor cells from different lineages and embryonic origins, strongly argues for a direct consequence of SF3B1 mutation. Second, the same pattern is observed irrespective of the mutated HEAT repeats of SF3B1. The reason for different hotspot mutations in different malignancies is largely unexplained but no different consequence was detected in the limited splicing events explored here. Third, the other mutated spliceosome compounds present in our series, including SRSF2 and ZRSR2, did not share the splicing abnormalities of the SF3B1 mutants. Finally, while no false negative was present in the clustering, the splicing pattern of 5 out of 161 samples from the three series was undistinguishable from that of SF3B1 samples, suggesting either experimental limitation of our splicing analysis or undetected abnormalities of the splicing machinery.  Our data clearly associate specific splicing abnormalities to SF3B1 mutations but these abnormalities are most probably not limited to those analyzed here. To statistically demonstrate splicing variants among more than 200 000 different splicing events remains challenging. It requires reliable molecular tools such as the latest generation of exon array or RNA-seq, efficient bioinformatics and large series of cases. It is thus likely that only the most consistent events were picked by the analysis of a limited number of mutated cases. Splicing forms yet to be discovered may better explain the oncogenic pathways activated by mutant SF3B1. Finally, our results do not rule out functions of SF3B1 besides splicing, which deregulations could intervene in oncogenesis.  Assessing the functional significance of novel putative oncogenes remains a significant challenge given the limitations of current loss-of-function tools. Here, we describe a method that employs TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of inducible degron tags (Degron-KI) that provides a versatile approach for the functional characterization of novel cancer genes and addresses many of the shortcomings of current tools. The Degron-KI system allows for highly specific, inducible, and allele-targeted inhibition of endogenous protein function, and the ability to titrate protein depletion with this system is able to better mimic pharmacologic inhibition compared with RNAi or genetic knockout approaches. The Degron-KI system was able to faithfully recapitulate the effects of pharmacologic EZH2 and PI3Ka inhibitors in cancer cell lines. The application of this system to the study of a poorly understood putative oncogene, SF3B1, provided the first causal link between SF3B1 hotspot mutations and splicing alterations. Surprisingly, we found that SF3B1-mutant cells are not dependent upon the mutated allele for in vitro growth, but instead depend upon the function of the remaining wild-type alleles. Collectively, these results demonstrate the broad utility of the Degron-KI system for the functional characterization of cancer genes. Cancer Res; 75(10); 1949–58. 2015 AACR. Introduction Although cancer genome sequencing studies have identified a large number of recurrently mutated genes (1, 2), functional studies are required to determine whether or not these genes present viable targets for cancer therapy. For instance, it is pivotal to establish that potential targets are required for tumor maintenance rather than representing initiating lesions that are no longer required for neoplastic growth. RNAi technology has been widely used to interrogate oncogene dependence by testing the impact of gene/protein knockdown in cell lines harboring the respective gene or pathway alterations. While RNAi has revolutionized our ability to perform genetic loss-of-function studies, it is known to be fraught with significant off-target effects (3–5). RNAi-based offtarget effects are particularly problematic for studies using cell proliferation as a phenotypic readout, as any off-target activity toward essential housekeeping genes has the potential to yield a false-positive result. In fact, it is likely that the propensity of RNAibased methods to yield false-positive results significantly contributes to the recently raised concerns around the lack of reproducibility in cancer biology publications (6, 7). Many cancer genes, such as oncogenes, exhibit dominant behavior, where only one allele is mutated and thought to drive the tumorigenic effect. In order to distinguish the effects of the mutated from wild-type alleles, a method that allows for the selective inhibition of one but not the other allele would be highly desirable. It is often challenging or impossible, however, to design RNAi reagents that can discriminate between the mutant and wild-type alleles, owing to sequence constraints and the general tolerance of single-base-pair mismatches in many positions (8). Recent advances in somatic knockout technologies, in particular the CRISPR/Cas9 system (9), provide powerful tools for genetic loss-of-function studies. While being more efficient than previous somatic genome engineering technologies, CRISPR-based gene knockouts have significant limitations for the study of essential genes, as gene inactivation is not inducible, generally occurs with slow kinetics (several days), and cannot be reversed in order to mimic intermittent target inhibition. Thus, CRISPR can readily be applied toward the knockout of tumor suppressor genes, but provides less utility toward the study of essential genes such as oncogenes due to the inability to generate stable knockout clones for genes required for cancer cell proliferation. To address some of the shortcomings of current genetic tools toward the functional characterization of novel oncogenes, we sought to develop a system that ideally would (i) have minimal off-target effects, (ii) enable allele-specific targeting, and (iii) allow for inducible and reversible gene depletion. In this study, we devised a method that allows for allele-specific regulation of endogenous proteins using a chemically regulated destabilization domain (DD) tag (10). We refer to this method as Degron-knockin (Degron-KI) and demonstrate its application to interrogate cancer dependence of known and novel oncogenes. 1 Oncology Disease Area, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts. 2 Oncology Translational Medicine, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts. 3 Developmental and Molecular Pathways, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

At low seeding density, Mel202 requires 30% conditioned medium to support cell proliferation. All lines were authenticated by SNP fingerprinting, and generally used within 20 passages. TALENs targeting p53 and SF3B1 were purchased from LifeTech. Backbone donor vector for homologous recombination was generated by gene synthesis from LifeTech. Left and right homologous recombination arms were obtained from genomic PCR and cloned into the restriction sites in the backbone donor vector (Nde1 and Xho1 for the left arm; EcoR1 and Not1 for the right arm, Xho1 site was removed in the end). Detailed information on the targeting sequences of TALENs and CRISPR as well as the donor vector design and PCR primers are provided in Supplementary Experimental Procedures. The chemical compounds used in this study are as follows: Doxorubicin (Sigma) and Nutlin-3 (Sigma); BYL719 (Novartis); El1 (Novartis); Shield- 1 (Clontech). Shield-1 powder was dissolved in 100% EtOH at 1mmol/L and stored at 20 C. Shield-1 was added to the fresh tissue culture media right before usage. Antibodies Primary antibodies: p53 (DO-1, sc-126; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1C12, #2524 CST for immunofluorescence), p21 (c-19, sc-397; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), EZH2 (5246s, CST, both for Western blot and immunofluorescence), H3 (9715s; CST), H3K27Me3 (9756s; CST), PIK3CA (4249s; CST), pAKT (4058L; CST), AKT (9272s; CST), GAPDH (IMG-5019A-1, IMGENEX), SF3B1 (p221-3; MBL International, both for Western blot and immunofluorescence). Secondary antibodies: anti-mouse IgG IRDye800 (800-656-7625; Rockland), goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (sc-2030; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (sc-2031; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-Mouse IgG Alexa Fluor (A11005; LifeTech), goat anti-Rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor (A11012; LifeTech). Positive clones were further verified by junction PCR and locus PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2). In vitro cell proliferation (colony formation, three-dimensional growth assay) Colony formation: Cells were seeded at a very low density in 6- well plates for 10 to 14 days, followed by crystal violet staining (0.5 g crystal violet, 27 mL 37% formaldehyde, 100 mL 10  PBS, 10 mL methanol, 863 dH20 to 1L). Seeded cell numbers: HCT116 (1,500 cells), NCIH1048 (10,000 cells), Mel-Juso (3,000 cells), ESS-1 (3,000 cells), Mel202 (6,000 cells). Conditioned medium (30%) was added in the Mel202 foci formation assay. Mel202 three-dimensional (3D) growth assay: 300 cells were seeded in 80 mL of culture medium (containing 30% conditional medium) in a 96-well ultra-low attachment round bottom plate (Costar; 7007). Pictures were taken after 9 days. In both cases, fresh Shld compound was added every 5 days. RNAseq analysis Reads were aligned to the human genome using a reference transcriptome and a modified version of Tophat, as previously described (11). Expression levels for UCSC genes and transcripts were determined using Cufflinks (12), summed for genes with multiple genomic loci, then rescaled so that the upper quartile gene expression level in each experiment was 10. Sequencing reads and gene expression values were deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO ID: Series GSE66719). Details of RNAseq analysis and other Materials and Methods can be found in Supplementary Experimental Procedures. Results The DD tag is a derivative of human FKBP12 that is stabilized in the presence of the small-molecule ligand Shield-1 (Shld), but becomes unstable and subjected to proteasomal degradation once Shld compound is withdrawn (10). We reasoned that introduction of the DD tag by homologous recombination at the N-terminus of endogenous genes should impart allele-specific protein stability regulation through addition or withdrawal of Shld (Fig. 1A). To test the feasibility of this approach, we examined if this system can be used to inducibly regulate the function of TP53, a critical tumor suppressor gene. The DD-tag fusion was knocked into the TP53 gene locus of the diploid HCT116 cell line using TALENs, and several clones were isolated by puromycin selection. The DD-tag fusion increases protein size by 12 kDA (Supplementary Fig. S1A), thus allowing for easy distinction of heterozygous clones, which express both DD-tagged and untagged protein, compared with homozygous clones, where only the DD-tagged version but no untagged endogenous protein is detectable. "Homozygous" DD-tagged clones can either represent clones that have the DD tag inserted in all alleles, or alternatively may harbor a DD knock-in of one allele with the remaining alleles being inactivated (leading to knock-out) through error-prone non-homologous end joining, thus resulting in expression of only the DD-tagged protein. While these two possibilities cannot easily be distinguished by Western blot, they become readily evident by targeted sequencing of the genomic insertion site (Supplementary Fig. S2). Notably, out of 24 puroresistant clones analyzed, 8 (33%) exhibited expression of only the DD-tagged p53 protein, indicating homozygous targeting (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The homozygous DD-p53 clone displayed efficient depletion of TP53 upon Shld withdrawal, whereas p53 protein levels were not altered by Shld removal in the parental HCT116 cells (Fig. 1B and C; Supplementary Figs. S3A and S4A). We next examined if the extent of p53 depletion by the Degron-KI system was sufficient to mirror a TP53 knockout phenotype by investigating its impact on DNA damage response and MDM2 inhibition (13), which require an intact p53 pathway. Similar to parental HCT116 cells, when cultured in the presence of Shld to stabilize the DD-p53 protein, the homozygous DD-p53 clone robustly activated the DNA damage response pathway when treated with the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin (Fig. 1D and E). In addition, the sensitivity of DD-p53 clone (in the presence of Shld) to the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 was similar to that of the parental cells (Fig. 1F), indicating that the DD-p53 protein retains wild-type function. Strikingly, Shld withdrawal in DD-p53 cells strongly suppressed the induction of p21 upon doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 1D and E) and rendered these cells insensitive to the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 (Fig. 1F). By contrast, Shld withdrawal had no effect in the parental cells (Fig. 1D, E, and F). Together, these findings demonstrate that the Degron-KI system is able to recapitulate a TP53 knockout phenotype.

Published OnlineFirst March 18, 2015; DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2930  We next sought to investigate whether the Degron-KI system can be used for the functional validation of oncogene dependence. Recurrent hotspot mutations in EZH2 have been described in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; ref. 14), and EZH2- mutated cell lines are sensitive to pharmacologic EZH2 inhibitors (15–19). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce a DD tag in the EZH2 locus in Karpas422 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2H), which harbor the EZH2 Y641N mutation and are sensitive to EZH2 inhibitors (16, 18, 19). The EZH2-wild-type cell line HCT116 was used as a negative control. CRISPR-based DD-tag insertion at the endogenous EZH2 locus in HCT116 cells was even more efficient than DD-p53 tagging with TALENs. In fact, when wild-type Cas9 was used, untagged EZH2 protein was almost undetectable in the polyclonal population following puromycin selection, indicating that the majority of cells had homozygous expression of the DD tag (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5C). By contrast, use of a Cas9 nickase mutant (20–22) resulted in mostly heterozygous DD-EZH2 targeting (Supplementary Fig. S5B), thus providing an approach to effectively generate both heterozygous and homozygous Degron-KI clones in HCT116 cells. Withdrawal of Shld caused destabilization of the DD-tagged EZH2 alleles in both HCT116 and Karpas422 Degron-KI clones (Fig. 2A and D; Supplementary Figs. S3B, 4B, and 6A), and resulted in robust inhibition of H3K27 tri-methylation, the major histone substrate of EZH2 (Fig. 2A and D; ref. 23). Notably, Shld withdrawal markedly impaired the proliferation of DD-EZH2–tagged Karpas422 cells, whereas no effect on cell growth was observed in the HCT116 control cell line (Fig. 2C and E), thus recapitulating the selective dependence observed with pharmacologic EZH2 inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B; ref. 19). Moreover, the inhibition of both H3K27 tri-methylation and proliferation occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, F, and G), demonstrating that the Degron-KI system can be used to mimic concentration-dependent inhibition by pharmacologic agents. To further establish the broad applicability of the Degron-KI system, we next applied it to PIK3CA, a well-established oncogene with several small-molecule inhibitors in clinical trials (24–26). DD tags were knocked into the PIK3CA locus of NCI-H1048, a Figure 1. Depletion of DD-p53 upon Shld withdrawal mimics p53 loss of function in Degron-KI–engineered HCT116 DD-p53 cells. A, schematic depiction of the Degron-KI strategy. TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9 induces double-strand breaks at the N-terminus of the coding region of the endogenous locus, which facilitates homologous recombination–mediated knock-in of the degron tag in the presence of the donor vector. The donor vector contains a PuroR -P2A-DD cassette that is flanked by left and right homology arms ( 1 kb each; black). After homologous recombination, the puromycin resistance gene and DD-tagged gene will be expressed under the control of the endogenous promoter due to the ribosomal skipping sequence P2A. B, Western blot of parental and homozygous DDp53–tagged HCT116 cells in the presence or absence of 1 mmol/L Shld. DD-p53 marks the DD-tagged protein, whereas p53 indicates the migration of untagged p53. GAPDH serves as a loading control. C, time course of protein depletion after Shld withdrawal. DD-p53–tagged HCT116 cells were cultured in 1 mmol/L Shld, and lysates for Western blotting were harvested at the indicated times after Shld withdrawal. D and E, cells were treated with vehicle EtOH or Shld (1 mmol/L) for 24 hours, followed by doxorubicin (500 nmol/L) treatment for another 18 hours. Samples were collected for Western blot (D) and p21 qRT-PCR (E). F, dose response of p53-DD clone viability after treatment with MDM-2 inhibitor Nutlin-3. Cells were first treated with vehicle EtOH or Shld (1 mmol/L) for 24 hours, followed by Nutlin-3 treatment for 4 days.

In response to Shld withdrawal, homozygous DDtagged PIK3CA clones (Supplementary Fig. S2D and S2J) demonstrated robust suppression of p-AKT (a marker of PI3K pathway activation) and inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Fig. S4C). These phenotypes closely mirrored suppression of the PI3Ka pathway by the selective PI3Ka inhibitor NVPBYL719 (25). As was the case for the DD-EZH2 clones, both pathway modulation and growth inhibition in DD-tagged PIK3CA clones could be titrated by adjusting the amount of Shld (Fig. 3D and E), thus recapitulating the dose-responsiveness of a pharmacologic PI3Ka inhibitor (Fig. 3D and E). Furthermore, PI3Ka protein levels and downstream signaling (p-AKT inhibition) were markedly suppressed at 8 hours after Shld withdrawal, with some additional reduction by 24 hours (Fig. 3C). Collectively, the ability of the Degron-KI system to mirror the activity of pharmacologic inhibitors such as EZH2 and PI3Ka inhibitors demonstrates the utility of the Degron-KI system for the functional validation of oncogene dependence. We next set out to apply the Degron-KI system toward the study of a novel and less well-understood oncogene. The spliceosome component SF3B1 was recently found to be recurrently mutated in myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and uveal melanoma (27–31). SF3B1 mutations are generally heterozygous and cluster at codons 625, 666, and 700, a mutation pattern that is characteristic for oncogenes and suggests possible gain of function. Yet it remains unclear what functional role SF3B1 mutations may play during oncogenesis and whether deregulated SF3B1 activity is required for cancer maintenance. SF3B1 small-molecule inhibitors are currently under development and have entered clinical trials (32). The fact that SF3B1 is part of the spliceosome, however, raises the concern that panSF3B1 inhibitors may exhibit significant toxicities in normal tissues and thus present a very narrow therapeutic window. In order to address whether or not SF3B1 is broadly required for cellular growth, even in the absence of oncogenic alterations, we generated both heterozygous and homozygous DD-SF3B1 clones in Mel-Juso, a melanoma cell line expressing wild-type SF3B1 (Supplementary Fig. S2E). Depletion of one copy of SF3B1 in heterozygous DD-SF3B1 clones had no impact on growth (Fig. 4A and B, clone #3). By contrast, Shld withdrawal in homozygous DD-SF3B1 clones led to robust SF3B1 protein depletion and markedly impaired growth (Fig. 4A and B, clones #1 and #2; Fig. 4E; Supplementary Figs. S4D and 6B). As before, this Figure 2. EZH2 Degron-KI mirrors the activity of pharmacologic EZH2 inhibitors.

Together, these findings indicate that while SF3B1 is not haploinsufficient, complete inhibition of SF3B1 is not tolerated in SF3B1 wild-type cells, therefore substantiating the toxicity concerns for a pan-SF3B1 inhibitor. A potential avenue to circumvent the normal tissue toxicity of pan-SF3B1 inhibition would be the development of SF3B1 inhibitors that selectively target the mutant protein. However, given the challenges and resources required toward the development of mutant-selective inhibitors, it will be critical to confirm that SF3B1 mutations are in fact required for tumor maintenance. We therefore sought to employ the Degron-KI system to assess the impact of mutant-specific SF3B1 inhibition in two SF3B1-mutant cancer cell line models, the endometrial cell line ESS-1, and the uveal melanoma cell line Mel202. When analyzing DD-tagged ESS-1 clones, we noticed that this cell line is polyploid, expressing at least two wild-type and one mutant allele (K666N hotspot mutation). Allele-specific targeting was confirmed through allelic phasing of the DD tag with the K666N SF3B1 mutation by RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S8A–S8D), yielding several clones that selectively deplete either all copies of SF3B1, two copies, or only one copy of SF3B1, including clones that selective target only the mutant or wild-type alleles (Supplementary Table S1). Similar to the findings in the SF3B1 wild-type cell line, Shld withdrawal in clones that deplete all copies of SF3B1 strongly inhibited the growth of ESS-1 cells (Fig. 5A, clones #1 and #2), indicating that SF3B1 is also required for the growth of ESS-1 cells. Surprisingly, however, the selective depletion of mutant SF3B1 protein, which was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S4E), did not impact the proliferation of ESS-1 cells (Fig. 5A, clones #3 and #4). By contrast, the selective depletion of the wildtype protein profoundly inhibited cell growth, despite continued expression of mutant SF3B1 protein (Fig. 5A, clones #7, #8, and #9). To exclude the possibility that the dependence on wild-type SF3B1 in this cell line is due to a gene dosage effect, as cells harbor only one mutant and likely two wild-type copies of SF3B1, we investigated the impact of Shld withdrawal on clones that had a DD tag inserted in both the mutant and one wild-type copy of SF3B1, where cells continued to express presumably only one remaining copy of the SF3B1 wild-type protein. Shld withdrawal in these clones also had no discernable growth impact (Fig. 5A, clones #5 and #6), despite having a similar total level of remaining SF3B1 protein compared with clones #7, #8, and #9 (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S4E). Collectively, these findings suggest that the in vitro growth of ESS-1 cells critically depends on the remaining wild-type copies of SF3B1 but not mutant SF3B1. Given these unexpected findings in ESS-1 cells, we wanted to investigate the effects of allele-specific SF3B1 inhibition in an additional cancer cell line model. The uveal melanoma line Mel202 harbors the SF3B1 R625G hotspot mutation, which is recurrently mutated in primary uveal melanoma tumors (27, 28). This mutation has previously been described to correlate with alternative splicing of the genes UQCC and CRNDE in uveal melanoma tumors (33), but a causal relationship between SF3B1 mutations and these alternative splicing patterns has not yet been established. Mel202 cells were found to be expressing one mutant and multiple wild-type alleles of SF3B1. Using the Degron-KI system, we again were able to obtain Mel202 clones that had DDtag insertions in single or multiple alleles of SF3B1. During the clone characterization, we identified clones that exhibited a Figure 3. PIK3CA Degron-KI mirrors the activity of pharmacologic PI3Ka inhibitor.

This mutant knockout clone showed a reversal of the altered splicing pattern in UQCC and CRNDE to that of the SF3B1 wild-type cells (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S9), thus providing a robust readout for the functional inactivation of mutant SF3B1. Indeed, in clones that selectively DD-tag the R625G mutant but not wild-type SF3B1 alleles, Shld withdrawal reversed the altered splicing pattern of UQCC and CRNDE (Fig. 5C), indicating that the Degron-KI system allowed for robust inactivation of mutant SF3B1. By contrast, in clones that selectively DD-tag the wild-type SF3B1 alleles but not the R625G allele, Shld withdrawal did not affect the splicing pattern of UQCC and CRNDE (Fig. 5C). These findings demonstrate that SF3B1 mutations are causally linked to the alternative splicing of UQCC and CRNDE. Next, we wanted to examine the effects of selective SF3B1-mutant depletion on gene expression and alternative splicing at a global, genome-wide level. Analysis of the RNAseq data using CuffDiff (12) showed that selective depletion of the DD-R625G–mutant protein in MEL202 cells had little impact on the global gene expression pattern (Supplementary Fig. S10). By contrast, using MATS (34), we found that selective depletion of the SF3B1 mutant affected the alternative splicing of 138 genes, including several genes that were found to be alternatively spliced in primary uveal melanoma tumors harboring SF3B1 mutations, e.g., ABCC5, SERBP1, SNRPN, DLST, DYNLL1, ENOSF1, SLC3A2, STIM1, TMEM14C (ref. 33; Supplementary Tables S3–S4; Supplementary Fig. S11). Moreover, we found that the majority of alternative splicing events in response to mutant SF3B1 depletion consisted of alternative 30 splice sites, with little impact on 50 splice sites (Supplementary Fig. S12). These findings are consistent with SF3B10 s role as a core component of the U2 snRNP complex that promotes the initial formation of the spliceosome at 30 exon/intron boundaries (35). Together, these findings indicate that SF3B1 mutations alter spliceosome activity that lead to "aberrant" use of alternate 30 splice sites. Despite the efficient reversion of the altered splicing pattern, however, mutant-selective depletion of SF3B1 had no significant impact on in vitro growth in both two-dimensional and 3D tissue culture systems (Fig. 5D and F, clones #1 and #2). By contrast, as was previously observed in ESS-1 cells, the wild-type selective depletion of SF3B1 significantly impaired the growth of MEL202 cells (Fig. 5D and F, clone #4). The results from these two SF3B1- mutant cancer cell line models suggest that the SF3B1-mutant Figure 4. SF3B1 Degron-KI demonstrates that SF3B1 is required for the growth of SF3B1 wild-type cells.

Moreover, the critical dependence on the remaining wild-type copies of SF3B1 indicates that SF3B1 hotspot mutants must be defective in some essential cellular activity that requires compensation by the remaining wild-type protein. Discussion The Degron-KI system described here presents a method for the functional characterization and validation of novel cancer genes, and provides several features that address some shortcomings of current genetic loss-of-function tools. First, in contrast to RNAibased methods, the Degron-KI approach should have minimal off-target effects, as the DD tag should only create fusion genes for the gene of interest. Indeed, a genome-wide survey by RNAseq of several DD-SF3B1–tagged Mel202 clones revealed that DD-tag fusions were only detected at the SF3B1 gene locus (Supplementary Fig. S13). Using RNAseq, we also confirmed that the addition of Shld has minimal to no effects on global gene expression (Supplementary Fig. S10). Moreover, the ability to study each clone in the presence and absence of Shld provides an ideal isogenic setting and a robust control for any potential CRISPRinduced genomic alterations. A potential limitation of the Degron-KI approach is that it only works efficiently when applied as an N-terminal fusion (10, and data not shown) and thus requires that proteins can tolerate N-terminal tagging. While Cterminal degron fusion systems have been described (36, 37), we found that protein depletion was much less effective compared with the DD-Shld system (data not shown). In addition, for some genes the expression level of DD-tagged protein was reduced compared with the untagged protein, possibly due to slight alteration in protein stability (incomplete stabilization through Shld) or translation efficiency (due to the P2A ribosome skipping site). Importantly, however, for 5 of 6 genes that we have tested so far, we found that homozygous DD-tagged clones behaved similarly to the parental cell line, suggesting that in most cases the DD-tagged protein is sufficiently expressed and functional. Further supporting the high reproducibility of the Degron-KI method, our analysis of multiple independent DD-tagged clones revealed similar phenotypic results for each gene studied. A second feature of the Degron-KI approach is that it enables inducible, titratable, and reversible gene depletion. A key requirement for any loss-of-function method is the ability to efficiently inhibit protein function. Although the extent of protein depletion with the Degron-KI system was robust for the proteins tested in our study, it appears to be incomplete in most cases. Therefore, the Degron-KI approach described here will most likely create hypomorphs rather than complete null states. Consistent with this notion, Shld withdrawal in the DDtagged clone led to robust but slightly weaker inhibition of pAKT and cell proliferation in NCIH1048 DD-PIK3CA cells compared with the PI3Ka small-molecule inhibitor BYL719. However, it is important to note that in all cases tested, the extent of protein depletion was sufficient to recapitulate genetic (p53) or pharmacologic (EZH2, PIK3CA) loss-of-function phenotypes, as judged by downstream pathway inhibition and impact on growth (in the case of oncogene dependence). Another important feature of the Degron-KI system is that, in contrast with current genetic tools, it allows for the titration of gene inactivation by varying the dose of Shld. The titration of Shld in DD-PIK3CA lines, for instance, was able to mirror the dose-dependent inhibition of pathway and growth modulation by a pharmacologic PI3Ka inhibitor. Collectively, the reversibility and ability to titrate protein depletion with the Degron-KI system provide a closer surrogate of target modulation by pharmacologic inhibitors. We would like to note that the Degron-KI method is highly efficient and broadly applicable. We were able to recover high proportions of correctly DD-tagged clones for 4 different genes tested across 7 cell line models, including a nonadherent DLBCL cell line that is difficult to transfect. Many cancer cell lines exhibit aneuploidy, which creates a challenge for somatic engineering as many loci will be present at more than two copies. Using CRISPR-based targeting, however, we were able to engineer "homozygously" DD-tagged clones in a single round of transfection even in cell lines that were triploid or tetraploid for the locus of interest. Together with a recent study that developed a similar approach but was restricted to a single gene and a single cell line (38), these findings indicate that the Degron-KI approach should be broadly applicable to many genes and cell line models. Lastly, a key feature of the Degron-KI system is the ability for allele-specific targeting. The application of this technology to the study of the putative oncogene SF3B1 yielded several important insights. SF3B1 mutations cluster at hotspots and are suggestive of gain of function, but their mechanism of action and oncogene dependence remained unclear. Although previous studies demonstrated a correlation between SF3B1 mutation and aberrant splicing, allele-specific targeting enabled us to provide the first demonstration that this altered splicing pattern can be directly reversed by inhibition of the mutant but not the wild-type protein. Our data indicate that SF3B1 mutations alter spliceosome activity, leading to aberrant use of alternate 30 splice sites. Moreover, allelespecific targeting allowed us to separate the impact on alternative splicing of the mutant protein from the cell-essential spliceosome function performed by the wild-type SF3B1 protein. Surprisingly, the reversal of aberrant splicing in response to SF3B1-mutant– specific inhibition did not translate to growth-inhibitory effects in the two SF3B1-mutant cancer models tested. Perhaps even more unexpected, SF3B1-mutated cells are critically dependent on the function of the remaining wild-type SF3B1 allele(s), and sole expression of mutant SF3B1 is not sufficient to maintain in vitro growth. Together, these findings indicate that the splicing alterations induced by SF3B1 mutations are not required for in vitro cancer proliferation. The dependence on the wild-type SF3B1 allele suggests that the SF3B1 mutations have characteristics of a loss-of-function allele with respect to in vitro growth, potentially explaining why SF3B1 mutations are always heterozygous, as homozygous alterations may not be compatible with cell growth. It is possible that SF3B1-mutant function is only required for in vivo growth or other aspects of tumorigenesis, or that growth dependence was lost with repeated passaging in tissue culture. Alternatively, SF3B1 mutations may present a predisposing or initiating event that is not required for continued cancer growth. Despite the potential caveats outlined above, the findings described raise caution as to whether the selective targeting of SF3B1-mutant protein will yield robust antitumor effects. Moreover, the finding that SF3B1 appears to also be essential in cells lacking oncogenic SF3B1 alterations raises potential concerns regarding the therapeutic index for pan-SF3B1 inhibitors. As illustrated by the case of SF3B1, the Degron-KI approach described here presents a powerful tool to assess dominant and Zhou et al. 1956 Cancer Res; 75(10) May 15, 2015 Cancer Research Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 27, 2017. © 2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

134||The splicing factor SF3B1 is the most commonly mutated gene in the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), particularly in patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS). We investigated the functional effects of SF3B1 disruption in myeloid cell lines: SF3B1 knockdown resulted in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and impaired erythroid differentiation and deregulation of many genes and pathways, including cell cycle regulation and RNA processing. MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared with wild-type cases include genes that are involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1 and CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7 and SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8 and HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. This is the first study to determine the target genes of SF3B1 mutation in MDS CD34+ cells. Our data indicate that SF3B1 has a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link.  Go to: Introduction The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) malignancies characterized by blood cell dysplasia and peripheral blood cytopenia. Approximately 30–40% of MDS patients will develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML).1  The recent discovery of somatic splicesomal mutations in MDS has revealed a new leukemogenic pathway involving spliceosomal dysfunction.2, 3 Somatic mutations in the splicing factor genes SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2 are frequent in MDS patients.4 Importantly, these genes encode proteins that are all involved in 3′-splice site recognition during pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing. Splicing factor gene mutations occur in over 50% of MDS patients, are highly specific to this disorder, and occur in a mutually exclusive manner.5, 6, 7  SF3B1, encoding a core component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, involved in the recognition of the branchpoint sequence, is the most commonly mutated gene found in MDS (20–28% of all patients).2, 8, 9 We and others have shown that mutations of the splicing factor SF3B1 are found in a high percentage (>70%) of MDS patients whose disease is characterised by the presence of ring sideroblasts, including both refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS).2, 8 The close association between SF3B1 mutation and the presence of ring sideroblasts is consistent with a causal relationship and makes this the first gene to be strongly associated with a specific morphological feature of MDS. Ring sideroblasts are characterised by an excess accumulation of iron in the mitochondria of erythroblasts,10 and SF3B1 mutant RARS cases show altered iron distribution characterised by coarse iron deposits compared with wild-type RARS cases.11 SF3B1 mutations are generally more prevalent in low-risk MDS and have been shown to be independent predictors of favorable clinical outcome in MDS in most studies.8, 11 The clinical consequences of SF3B1 mutation in MDS are clear, but the functional consequences of these mutations in human cells remain poorly understood. Altered RNA splicing has been suggested as the mechanism underlying the observed phenotypic changes concomitant to splicing factor gene mutations, including SF3B1; 3, 12, 13 however, the target genes in the HSC of MDS cases with SF3B1 mutations are yet to be defined.  SF3B1 mutations in MDS are primarily heterozygous point mutations. The presence of hotspots and the absence of nonsense or frameshift mutations in SF3B1 in MDS patients suggest that SF3B1 mutations are likely to be gain/change-of-function (neomorphic) mutations. A heterozygous Sf3b1+/− knockout mouse model has been shown to develop ring sideroblasts, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of SF3B1 may lead to their formation.11 Recent similar studies have not made this observation, however.14, 15 Thus, it is yet to be determined whether SF3B1 mutations found in MDS are loss-of-function mutations or gain/change-of-function mutations. In this study, we thus evaluated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell growth, gene expression and splicing in a range of myeloid cell lines and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the CD34+ cells of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  Go to: Materials and methods Myeloid cell lines culture  K562, HEL, TF1 and SKM1 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. TF1 and SKM1 cultures were supplemented with 2 and 1 ng/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, respectively.  SF3B1 knockdown  Three non-overlapping small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting SF3B1 and two different scramble sequences with guanine–cytosine content similar to the siRNA sequences (Stealth Select RNAi, Invitrogen) were used to knock down SF3B1 in myeloid cell lines. For each transfection, 30 pmol of siRNA and 2 × 106 cells were electroporated in an Amaxa Nucleofector I, using the Amaxa cell optimization kit V (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Evaluation of green fluorescent protein-positive cells obtained using the pmaxGFP fluorescent expression plasmid confirmed >80% of successfully transfected cells after 24 h. Readout data are reported as mean±s.e.m. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.  Cell growth assay  Live and dead cells were assessed by trypan blue viability testing and counted using a hemocytometer.  Cell cycle analysis  Cells were fixed with ice cold methanol, incubated with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNaseA, as previously described.16 Data were acquired on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed using FLOWJO software 7.6.4 (FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA).  Erythroid differentiation  To induce erythroid differentiation, K562, TF1 and HEL cells were cultured with hemin 50 μm for 72 h. Erythroid differentiation was studied by analyzing the expression level of γ-globin (HBG1) using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) as described previously.17 Expression of the erythroid markers CD36, CD71 and CD235a was evaluated by flow cytometry as described previously.16  Quantitative real-time PCR  Total RNA was reverse transcribed using Retroscript kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). The expression levels of SF3B1, ABCB7, FTMT, HBG1, KLF1 and B2M were determined using Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). B2M expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input complementary DNA (cDNA). Triplicate samples were run on a LightCycler 480 Real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK) and expression ratios were calculated using the ddCT method.18  Gene expression profiling  Total RNA (100 ng for each sample) was amplified and labeled with the 3′ IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips, as described previously.19, 20 CEL files were pre-processed using Robust Multi-chip Average and data analysis was performed using GeneSpring 7.3.1 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) 7.5 (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), as previously described.19 Analysis of gene set up- or downregulation was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis,21 as previously described (false discovery rate<0.1).2  Splicing analysis using human genome exon-junction microarray  Total RNA was DNAse treated (Invitrogen), purified (Agencourt RNA Clean XP) and amplified (100 ng) using Ambion WT Expression Kit (Affymetrix). The cDNA was subsequently fragmented and labeled using WT terminal labeling kit (Affymetrix). Samples were hybridized onto Affymetrix Human genome exon-junction arrays, which on average contain 119 unique probes per gene spanning every exon and known exon–exon junction. CEL files were analyzed using GenoSplice technology (www.genosplice.com).22, 23 Data were normalized using quantile normalization. Analysis at the exon level was performed taking into account only exon probes. Analysis at the splicing variant level was performed by taking into account exon–exon junction probes using the FAST DB splicing patterns annotation (release fastdb_2012_2). Unpaired Student's t-test was used to determine exon and splicing pattern variation between cells with SF3B1 knockdown and scramble controls. Genes were considered significantly deregulated when fold change was ⩾1.5 and P-value <0.05. Gene Ontology, KEGG and REACTOME analyses of differentially regulated genes were performed using DAVID.24  Splicing analysis using qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing  Splicing analysis of TP53 was performed using Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted individual bands from PCR-amplified cDNA. Primers and PCR conditions are listed in Supplementary Table S1.  Splicing analysis of cyclins CCNA2 and STK6 was performed using a qRT-PCR on cDNA, using primers specific for splice junctions corresponding to exon inclusion or skipping.25 Primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. TBP expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input cDNA.  RNA sequencing  Bone marrow samples were obtained from MDS patients and healthy controls and CD34+ cells isolated using MACS magnetic cell separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), as described previously.19, 20 RNA extracted from bone marrow CD34+ cells obtained from 12 MDS patients and 5 healthy controls was used for deep RNA-Seq. Eight of the 12 MDS cases (four RARS and four RCMD-RS) had SF3B1 gene mutation, whereas four cases (all RCMD) had no known mutations in splicing factor genes (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 or ZRSR2) (Supplementary Table S3), as determined by targeted next-generation sequencing data from a previous study.7  Total RNA was DNase treated (Invitrogen), purified using XP beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and processed (100 ng) using NEBNext Ultra directional mRNA Library prep (NEB, Hitchin, UK) as per the manufacturer's protocol for Illumina with two alterations: custom indexes were designed in house and an additional purification step was performed using XP beads (Beckman Coulter) rather than size selection. Samples were run on HiSeq2000 Illumina sequencing machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome using TopHat,26 which can handle reads spanning exon–exon boundaries. Data analysis was performed using edgeR27 to evaluate the whole transcript expression (false discovery rate<0.05) and with DEXSeq28 to evaluate differential exon usage (false discovery rate<0.05). At the expression level, only genes with at least 10 reads in four or more samples were included in the analysis; at the exon level, exons with fewer than 10 reads were excluded. Gender was included as an additional factor in the DEXSeq model testing for differential exon usage. Selected differentially expressed exons were validated using qRT-PCR (Supplemetary Figure S1, Supplementary Information). Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) v2.3 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) was used for visualization of the sequence reads. Pathway analysis was performed using IPA and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, as described above. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE63569.  Go to: Results SF3B1 knockdown inhibits cell growth, induces cell cycle arrest and impairs erythroid differentiation  SF3B1 was knocked down using siRNA technology in four myeloid cell lines (TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1) that we found to be wild type for SF3B1 (Supplementary Information), resulting in a significant decrease in expression ranging between 50 and 60% (Figure 1a).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting SF3B1 was compared with the corresponding cell line transfected with the scramble control. (a) SF3B1 mRNA expression measured 3 days after knockdown. (b ... Cell growth was inhibited in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown in comparison with the scramble control (Figure 1b). Cell cycle arrest in different phases was detected in different myeloid cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1c). K562 cells showed a significant G2M cell cycle arrest with a concomitant reduction in the percentage of cells in the G1 and S phase. TF1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase. HEL cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase and a significant increase in the sub-G1 cell population, indicating increased apoptosis. Similarly, SKM1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in S and G2M phase with a concomitant increase in the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 and G1 phase, indicating cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and an increase in apoptosis (Figure 1c).  Three cell lines (TF1, K562 and HEL) with SF3B1 knockdown were cultured with hemin to induce erythroid differentiation. We assessed the expression of the erythroid differentiation markers HBG1 and KLF1 using qRT-PCR. A significant reduction in the expression of HBG1 and KLF1 was observed in TF1 and K562 cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1d). In addition, we observed a reduction in the percentage of CD36+CD71+ and CD71+CD235a+ erythroid populations (significant for the CD36+CD71+ population) in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown compared with the scramble control (Figure 1e), suggesting that normal SF3B1 function is required for erythroid differentiation.17  RARS is characterized by FTMT accumulation and low expression levels of the iron transporter ABCB7.17, 29 We have previously shown that SF3B1 knockdown leads to decreased ABCB7 expression and increased FTMT expression in K562 cells.17 In this study, we have extended these observations to the other three myeloid cell lines investigated (Figure 2a). In addition, restoration of SF3B1 expression to normal levels after 10 days of culture was followed by restoration of ABCB7 expression levels to normal (Supplementary Figure S2).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown on gene expression and splicing. (a) ABCB7 and FTMT expression levels in TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1 cells with SF3B1 knockdown, as measured by qRT-PCR 48 h post transfection. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting ... Taken together, these data show that SF3B1 knockdown results in inhibition of cell growth, induction of cell cycle arrest and impairment of erythroid differentiation in myeloid cell lines.  SF3B1 knockdown alters gene expression  To evaluate the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on global gene expression, gene expression profiling was performed in the four myeloid cell lines. For each cell line, we compared the expression profiles of cells treated with two different siRNAs targeting SF3B1 with those of cells treated with a scramble control, 48 h post transfection.  We identified many genes that were up- or downregulated by >2-fold in each cell line treated with SF3B1 siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B). Four genes were upregulated (TFDP1, LOC100505759, MKRN1 and WRNIP1) and five genes were downregulated (ZC3H7A, CREBZF, SGK494, WSB1 and two probesets for SF3B1) in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  Pathway analysis was performed on the up- and downregulated genes in each cell line with SF3B1 knockdown using IPA. Significant deregulation of pathways related to cell cycle regulation was observed in all cell lines and of mTOR signaling and AMPK signaling pathways in three cell lines (Table 1). We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to identify pathways and processes showing coordinated up- or downregulation. Upregulated gene sets include p53 signaling in K562 and SKM1 cells, and several gene sets associated with regulation of transcription, spliceosome and splicing in K562 cells (Supplementary Table S4). Downregulated gene sets associated with the mitochondrial function were found in K562 and TF1 cells, and with cell cycle regulation in SKM1 and HEL cells (Supplementary Table S4). These data show that SF3B1 knockdown in the cell lines studied results in deregulation of many genes and pathways including cell cycle and RNA processing.  Table 1 Table 1 List of significant deregulated pathways in cell lines obtained using IPA SF3B1 knockdown impact on splicing  The genome-wide effects of SF3B1 knockdown on splicing were investigated in two myeloid cell lines (K562 and TF1) using human genome exon-junction arrays. The splicing profile of cells with SF3B1 knockdown (using two different siRNA per cell line) was compared with that of cells transfected with the scramble control.  We observed 2027 differentially expressed exons from 1419 genes, and 507 significant differentially regulated splicing variants (including exon skipping, intron retention and alternative splice sites) of 384 genes in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of CDC7 and SRSF11 in the data from both the cell lines, and of TP53 in TF1 cells. We found a significant overrepresentation of 3′ acceptor splice sites affected by alternative splicing events compared with 5′ donor splice sites (5:1 ratio, P=0.0027, χ2 test with Yates' correction), consistent with the known role of SF3B1 in the recognition of 3′ splice sites. Gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/), and many themes showed significant enrichment of genes affected at the level of exon usage and splice variants (Table 2). Cell cycle and RNA degradation were found to be consistently deregulated at both levels (Table 2). We investigated TP53 differential exon usage by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted bands. We observed exon skipping that was present in the SF3B1 knockdown cells only (Figure 2b).  Table 2 Table 2 Pathway analysis using human genome exon-junction array data at two different levels: differential exon usage and different splicing variant We also investigated whether two cell cycle genes (CCNA2 and STK6) previously shown to be aberrantly spliced in HeLa cells with SF3B1 knockdown,25 were also aberrantly spliced in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown in our study. Consistent with the finding in HeLa cells, we observed aberrant splicing of these genes using a qRT-PCR strategy as described previously (Figure 2c and d).25  RNA-Seq in HSPC from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations  To gain insight into the spectrum of genes that are deregulated or aberrantly spliced in association with SF3B1 mutation in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) of MDS patients, we used deep RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation (SF3B1 mutants), four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation (wild type) and five healthy controls (control) (Supplementary Table S3). Using IGV, we evaluated the expression of the SF3B1 alleles in SF3B1 mutant cases and observed a range of 45–52% of mutant allele frequency, indicating that both wild-type and mutant alleles were equally expressed (Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Figure S4).  We used edgeR to perform differential gene expression analysis of SF3B1 mutants versus wild type and control. At the whole transcript level, we observed a total of 526 genes (253 upregulated and 273 downregulated) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutants in comparison with wild type (Supplementary Table S5). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutants with control, we found 1823 significantly differentially expressed genes (646 upregulated and 1177 downregulated) (Supplementary Table S6). Genes linked to the pathogenesis of RARS and RCMD-RS, such as ALAS2 and ABCB7, were deregulated (ALAS2 upregulated and ABCB7 downregulated) in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. We also observed upregulation of the mitochondrial genes SLC25A37 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and GLRX5 in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control.  We performed an analysis using 121 genes either known to be expressed in erythroid cells30 or described as erythroid transcription factors in the literature. We found 42 differentially expressed genes (37 upregulated and 5 downregulated) when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control. These included heme biosynthetic enzymes (for example, ALAS2, ALAD, FECH and UROD), globin genes (for example, HBQ1, HBA2, HBB and HBA1) and transcription factors (for example, GATA1, GATA2 and KLF1). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we found a total of 32 differentially expressed genes (31 upregulated and 1 downregulated) of which 28 were overlapping with the differentially expressed genes found when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control.  We then performed pathway analysis on the significantly differentially expressed genes using IPA. Many pathways, including heme biosynthesis, mitotic roles of polo-like kinase and TNFR2 signaling, were significantly deregulated in the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type (Table 3). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with control, significantly deregulated pathways included apoptosis signaling, p53 signaling, cell cycle regulation and heme degradation (Supplementary Table S7). We next performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysisand many gene sets showing significant enrichment were identified in SF3B1 mutant versus wild type and control. Upregulated gene sets included several that were related to mitochondrial function, cell cycle checkpoints and mRNA splicing. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with control cases, downregulated gene sets included several that were related to cell differentiation and apoptosis (Supplementary Table S8). Many of these deregulated pathways and gene sets are relevant to the known pathophysiology of MDS and in particular of RARS and RCMD-RS.  Table 3 Table 3 Pathway analysis (IPA) of the significant differentially expressed genes between SF3B1 mutant and wild type obtained using edgeR DEXSeq was used to perform differential exon usage analysis of the RNAseq data to evaluate aberrantly spliced genes. At the exon level, we observed a total of 3506 exons (corresponding to 1924 genes) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (Table 4, Figure 3, Supplementary Table S9). Differential exon usage was observed in at least one exon of genes known to be involved in MDS pathophysiology (TP53 and EZH1), erythroid genes (ALAD, UROD and EPB42) and genes associated with cell cycle (AURKB and CRNDE) and RNA processing (RBM5, RBM25, PRPF40A and HNRNPD). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type cases, we found 3097 significantly differentially expressed exons (corresponding to 2022 genes) (Table 5, Figure 4, Supplementary Table S10). We found differential exon usage in at least one exon of genes involved in MDS pathophysiology (CBL, ASXL1 and DNMT3A), mitochondrial function (ALAS2, NDUFAF6), erythroid differentiation (NFE2L2, PPOX and HMBS) and mRNA processing (HNRNPD, U2AF2 and PRPF8). Interestingly, UQCC1, a gene involved in mitochondrial biogenesis31 and showing abnormal splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases in uveal melanoma,32 showed differential exon usage and upregulation in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with wild type and control in our study.

Table 4 Table 4 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and control, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq Table 5 Table 5 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and wild type, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq To identify pathways affected by differential exon usage, we performed pathway analysis on the genes showing significantly differentially expressed exons using IPA. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, we observed many pathways to be affected, including cell cycle, heme biosynthesis, DNA damage response, mitochondrial and haematopoietic progenitor cells pathway (Supplementary Table S11 and S12). Using DAVID functional annotation tool, we observed significant enrichment of biological themes including alternative splicing, RNA binding, mitochondrion, spliceosome and cell cycle.  Recently, a role for SF3B1 in the maintenance of genomic stability has also been reported where it functions in a DNA damage-induced mRNA splicing complex with BRCA1 and BCLAF1.33 Given that deregulation of the DNA damage response pathway was highlighted by the IPA pathway analysis, we performed an analysis using genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex. Several genes regulated by this complex showed differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (including NUMA1, RB1, CHUK and ABL1) and compared with wild type (NUMA1, PIAS1, SMAD4, BIRC2 and PTK2) (Supplementary Table S13). The overrepresentation of genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex was significant in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (P<0.001) and compared with wild type (P=0.0498, hypergeometric test). We also found many genes to be affected at the transcript level, including BIRC3, BCL2A1, GYPB, HBB and HBBP1 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control (Supplementary Table S13).  Go to: Discussion The identification of frequent somatic mutations of SF3B1 in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts suggests a direct correlation between the presence of mutations and this particular phenotype.2, 11, 13 However, the mechanism by which SF3B1 mutation leads to MDS with ring sideroblasts remains to be elucidated.  To illuminate the role of SF3B1 mutation in MDS pathophysiology, we have determined the effects of SF3B1 disruption on cell growth and gene expression in human hematological cells. First, we investigated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell function and gene expression in myeloid cell lines. Second, we used RNA-Seq to study the global gene expression changes and splicing abnormalities associated with the presence of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients.  We have shown that SF3B1 knockdown in four myeloid cell lines resulted in inhibition of cell growth and disruption of the cell cycle. It has recently been reported that Sf3b1+/− mice showed reduced numbers of HSC and compromised reconstitution capacity in lethally irradiated mice.14, 15 Thus, reduced expression of SF3B1 appears to result in impaired cell growth in hematopoietic cells. Similar observations have been made following reduced expression of other splicing factor genes, including U2AF1.3, 4, 34  We used two different microarray platforms to identify genes deregulated at the transcriptional and exon level by SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Gene expression profiling identified many deregulated genes, with four genes consistently upregulated, including TFDP1, and five genes downregulated, including CREBZF, in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown, several of which have a role in the control of cell growth. TFDP1 is involved in the control of transcriptional activity of G1/S cell cycle checkpoint genes,35 and CREBZF is a potent suppressor of cell growth, the effects of which are mediated through the tumor suppressor p53.36 Next, we employed exon-junction arrays to study the transcriptome in K562 and TF1 cells. We identified many differentially expressed exons and differentially regulated splicing variants in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of the CDC7 and SRSF11 genes, involved in cell cycle regulation and splicing, respectively, and of the TP53 gene. Several pathways including cell cycle, RNA processing, mitochondrion and apoptosis/p53 pathway were consistently deregulated in the cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  In summary, our data on myeloid cell lines suggest that the phenotype observed in cells with SF3B1 knockdown is mediated by aberrant splicing and expression of target genes involved in key biological processes.  RNA-Seq is the method of choice for a comprehensive analysis of global gene expression and splicing. In all relevant studies published to date, RNA-Seq has been performed on unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells from a small number of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations (n⩽3 per study), revealing interesting data.11, 37, 38 MDS arise in the HSC, and it is thus of critical importance that the effects of SF3B1 mutation on the transcriptome are studied in the cell of origin. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq on purified bone marrow CD34+ cells from 12 MDS patients, eight with ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutation and four without mutation in other splicing factor genes, and from five healthy controls.  We identified many significantly differentially expressed genes at the transcript level and the exon level when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. CD34+ cells from RCMD-RS and RARS patients display a particular expression profile of mitochondria-related genes;17, 20 we observed upregulation of ALAS2 (heme biosynthesis enzyme) and downregulation of ABCB7 (involved in the transport of iron from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm) in SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control, in agreement with our previous reports.17, 20 SLC25A37, encoding a mitochondrial iron importer, and GLRX5, encoding another mitochondrial protein, were both significantly upregulated in CD34+ cells of SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control. A recent study showed SLC25A37 mRNA upregulation in SF3B1 mutant bone marrow mononuclear cells of three MDS patients with RARS/-T.38 Evidence is thus mounting to suggest that upregulation of the iron importer SLC25A37 and downregulation of iron exporter ABCB7 may be linked to the increased mitochondrial iron accumulation observed in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts.39 Deregulation of these genes could also be consistent with an impaired ability of mitochondrial pathways to use iron that may result in an attempt to increase iron availability.  Importantly, we observed many genes associated with porphyrin and heme biosynthesis showing differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant cases, indicating altered splicing. These include ALAD and UROD when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and ALAS2 and PPOX when comparing with wild type. We suggest that the aberrant expression and exon usage of mitochondrial and heme-related genes in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation has a role in ring sideroblast formation and abnormal iron homeostasis observed in this patient group. Intriguingly, the most common congenital sideroblastic anemia (X-linked sideroblastic anemia) results from an ALAS2 mutation.40  The relative expression levels of the transcription factors GATA1 and GATA2 differed from normal in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation. The dynamic and strictly regulated change of expression from GATA2 to GATA1 during erythropoiesis has a crucial role,41 and any alteration of this pattern may be predicted to lead to aberrant erythropoiesis. We suggest that the aberrant expression and splicing of erythroid-related genes observed in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation may have a role in the ineffective erythropoiesis found in these patients.  In a previous study, RNA-Seq was used to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow mononuclear cells of two MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation to that of one healthy control.11 One hundred and thirty genes showed significant differential expression, 28 of which overlap with the genes differentially expressed between SF3B1 mutant and control in our study of CD34+ cells. These genes include MAP3K8 and CLEC5A, which have been previously shown to be downregulated in MDS.19, 42 Furthermore, 350 genes showed differential exon usage, and 52 of these were in common with the genes showing differential exon usage in our study of CD34+ cells. The overlapping genes include EZH1, ASXL1, CBL1 and SMAD4.  The mutant forms of ASXL1, CBL and TP53 are known to have an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of MDS, and intriguingly all these genes were found to be alternatively spliced in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  A recent study identified a DNA damage-induced BRCA1 protein complex containing BCLAF1 and SF3B1 (BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex).33 In response to DNA damage, the complex regulates pre-mRNA splicing of genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair and hence affects their transcription and pre-mRNA maturation.33 Importantly, we found many of the genes regulated by this complex to be differentially expressed and to show differential exon usage in our study. Genes showing differential transcript level changes included BIRC3 and BCL2A1, whereas NUMA1 showed differential exon usage when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we also found differential exon usage of the PIAS1 gene, a DNA damage response regulator.43, 44 It has been demonstrated that abrogation of members of this complex including BRCA1 and BCLAF1 results in genomic instability,33 a common feature of malignant cells. In MDS patients with mutant SF3B1, the function of this complex may be impaired, with possible downstream effects on the efficiency of DNA damage repair.  Many genes involved in RNA splicing and processing were found to show differential transcript levels, as well as differential exon usage in our study, including HNRNPD, U2AF2, PRPF8 and RBM25. A recent study showed RNA processing genes to be misspliced in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of MDS/AML patients with U2AF1 mutation.45 Intriguingly, there is limited overlap between the genes misspliced as a result of U2AF1 mutation and the RNA processing/splicing genes deregulated/aberrantly spliced in our SF3B1 mutant cases in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, suggesting that this process may be affected by different splicing mutations even if their target genes are distinct.  A recent study showed that defects in the splicing factor gene PRPF8 result in missplicing in myeloid malignancies and are associated with the presence of ring sideroblasts in advanced MDS and AML.46 Interestingly, we observed differential exon usage of PRPF8 in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with control in our study, indicating a link between SF3B1 and PRPF8 and the ring sideroblast phenotype. Our finding of differential exon usage of multiple RNA processing/splicing genes in the HSPC of cases with SF3B1 mutation points towards an exacerbation of aberrant splicing, with a wider number of downstream target genes affected. Emerging evidence from our study on SF3B1 and the study on U2AF145 thus supports the hypothesis that in MDS patients harboring splicing factor mutations, there is widespread disruption of the splicing machinery as a consequence of downstream effects of the mutant protein. Loss-of-function mutations in zebrafish Prpf8 have been shown to result in missplicing of TP53.47 We found TP53 to be aberrantly spliced in MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation compared with wild type and control.  Splicing factor mutations, including SF3B1, are considered to be founder mutations and must confer a selective growth advantage to the HSC, but how this occurs remains a mystery. We have identified differential splicing in several genes known to have a role in MDS pathogenesis, including TP53 and ASXL1, as well as genes involved in DNA damage repair, in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations. We suggest that the aberrant splicing of such genes may confer oncogenic properties that help drive the malignant process. In this study, we have determined the target genes of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients with ring sideroblasts, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying this phenotype.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and related disorders (myelodysplasia) comprise a group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by deregulated, dysplastic blood cell production and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)1 . Although the prevalence ofMDS has not been determined precisely, more than 10,000 people are estimated to develop myelodysplasia annually in the United States2 . Their indolent clinical course before leukaemic transformation and ineffective haematopoiesis with evidence of myeloid dysplasia indicate a pathogenesis distinct from that involved in de novo AML. Currently, a number of gene mutations and cytogenetic changes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS, including mutations of RAS, TP53 and RUNX1, and more recently ASXL1, c-CBL, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, TET2 and EZH2 (ref. 3). Nevertheless, mutations of this set of genes do not fully explain the pathogenesis of MDS because they are also commonly found in other myeloid malignancies and roughly 20% of MDS cases have no known genetic changes (ref. 4 and unpublished data). In particular, the genetic alterations responsible for the dysplastic phenotypes and ineffective haematopoiesis of myelodysplasia are poorly understood. Meanwhile, the recent development of massively parallel sequencing technologies has provided an expanded opportunity to discover genetic changes across the entire genomes or protein-coding sequences in human cancers at a single-nucleotide level5–10, which could be successfully applied to the genetic analysis of myelodysplasia to obtain a better understanding of its pathogenesis. Overview of genetic alterations In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of paired tumour/control DNA from 29 patients with myelodysplasia (Supplementary Table 1). Although incapable of detecting non-coding mutations and gene rearrangements, the whole-exome approach is a well-established strategy for obtaining comprehensive registries of protein-coding mutations at low cost and high performance. With a mean coverage of 133.8, 80.4% of the target sequences were analysed at more than 320 depth on average (Supplementary Fig. 1). All the candidates for somatic mutations (N 5 497) generated through our data analysis pipeline were subjected to validation using Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Methods I and Supplementary Fig. 2). Finally, 268 non-synonymous somatic mutations were confirmed with an overall true positive rate of 53.9% (Supplementary Fig. 3), including 206 missense, 25 nonsense, and 10 splice site mutations, and 27 frameshift-causing insertions/deletions (indels) (Supplementary Fig. 4). The mutation rate of 9.2 (0–21) per sample was significantly lower than that in solid tumours (16.2–302)7,11,12 and multiple myeloma (32.4)6 , but was comparable to that in AML (7.3–13)13–15 and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (11.5)16. Combined with the genomic copy number profile obtained by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array karyotyping, this array of somatic mutations provided a landscape of myelodysplasia genomes (Supplementary Fig. 5)17,18. 1 Cancer Genomics Project, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan. 2 Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 3 Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Manheim of the University of Heidelberg, 1–3 Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer, Mannheim 68167, Germany. 4 Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 5 Laboratory of Functional Genomics, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 6 Laboratory of Sequence Data Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 7 Division of Systems Biomedical Technology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 8 Nakauchi Stem Cell and Organ Regeneration Project, Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 9 Department of Hematology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8571, Japan. 10Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Ohtsuka Hospital, 2-8-1 Minami-Ohtsuka, Toshima-ku, Tokyo 170-0005, Japan. 11Division of Hematology, Internal Medicine, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, 1-30 Fujigaoka, Aoba-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 227-8501, Japan. 12Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich 81377, Germany. 13Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8700 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA. 14National University of Singapore, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, 28 Medical Drive, Singapore 117456, Singapore. 15Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University, 199 Tung Hwa North Rd, Taipei 105, Taiwan. *These authors contributed equally to this work. 64 | NATURE | VOL 478 | 6 OCTOBER 2011 ©2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved Novel gene targets in myelodysplasia The list of the somatic mutations (Supplementary Table 2) included most of the known gene targets in myelodysplasia with similar mutation frequencies to those previously reported, indicating an acceptable sensitivity of the current study. The mutations of the known gene targets, however, accounted for only 12.3% of all detected mutations (N 5 33), and the remaining 235 mutations involved previously unreported genes. Among these, recurrently mutated genes in multiple cases are candidate targets of particular interest, for which high mutation rates are expected in general populations. In fact, 8 of the 12 recurrently mutated genes were among the well-described gene targets in myelodysplasia (Supplementary Table 3). However, what immediately drew our attention were the recurrent mutations involving U2AF35 (also known as U2AF1), ZRSR2 and SRSF2 (SC35), because they belong to the common pathway known as RNA splicing. Including an additional three genes mutated in single cases (SF3A1, SF3B1 and PRPF40B), six components of the splicing machinery were mutated in 16 out of the 29 cases (55.2%) in a mutually exclusive manner (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2). Frequent mutations in splicing machinery RNA splicing is accomplished by a well-ordered recruitment, rearrangement and/or disengagement of a set of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes (U1, U2, and either U4/5/6 or U11/12), as well as many other protein components onto the pre-mRNAs. Notably, the mutated components of the spliceosome were all engaged in the initial steps of RNA splicing, except for PRPF40B, whose functions in RNA splicing are poorly defined. Making physical interactions with SF1 and a serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein, such as SRSF1 or SRSF2, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) that consists of the U2AF65 (U2AF2)– U2AF35 heterodimer, is involved in the recognition of the 39 splice site (39SS) and its nearby polypyrimidine tract, which is thought to be required for the subsequent recruitment of the U2 snRNP, containing SF3A1 as well as SF3B1, to establish the splicing A complex (Fig. 1)19. ZRSR2 (or Urp), is another essential component of the splicing machinery. Showing a close structural similarity to U2AF35, ZRSR2 physically interacts with U2AF65, as well as SRSF1 and SRSF2, with a distinct function from its homologue, U2AF35 (ref. 20). To confirm and extend the initial findings in the whole-exome sequencing, we studied mutations of the above six genes together with three additional spliceosome-related genes, including U2AF65, SF1 and SRSF1, in a large series of myeloid neoplasms (N 5 582) using a high-throughput mutation screen of pooled DNA followed by confirmation/identification of candidate mutations (refs 21 and 22 and Supplementary Methods II). In total, 219 mutations were identified in 209 out of the 582 specimens of myeloid neoplasms through validating 313 provisional positive events in the pooled DNA screen (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). The mutations among four genes, U2AF35 (N 5 37), SRSF2 (N 5 56), ZRSR2 (N 5 23) and SF3B1 (N 5 79), explained most of the mutations with much lower mutational rates for SF3A1 (N 5 8), PRPF40B (N 5 7), U2AF65 (N 5 4) and SF1 (N 5 5) (Fig. 2). Mutations of the splicing machinery were highly specific to diseases showing myelodysplastic features, including MDS either with (84.9%) or without (43.9%) increased ring sideroblasts, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (54.5%), and therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (25.8%), but were rare in de novo AML (6.6%) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (9.4%) (Fig. 3a). The mutually exclusive pattern of the mutations in these splicing pathway genes was confirmed in this large case series, suggesting a common impact of these mutations on RNA splicing and the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia (Fig. 3b). The frequencies of mutations showed significant differences across disease types. Surprisingly, SF3B1 mutations were found in the majority of the cases with MDS characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, that is, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) (19/23 or 82.6%) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia with $ 15% ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (38/50 or 76%) with much lower mutation frequencies in other myeloid neoplasms.

RNA splicing is initiated by the recruitment of U1 snRNP to the 59SS. SF1 and the larger subunit of the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF), U2AF65, bind the branch point sequence (BPS) and its downstream polypyrimidine tract, respectively. The smaller subunit of U2AF (U2AF35) binds to the AG dinucleotide of the 39SS, interacting with both U2AF65 and a SR protein, such as SRSF2, through its UHM and RS domain, comprising the earliest splicing complex (E complex). ZRSR2 also interacts with U2AF and SR proteins to perform essential functions in RNA splicing. After the recognition of the 39SS, U2 snRNP, together with SF3A1 and SF3B1, is recruited to the 39SS to generate the splicing complex A.

All rights reserved for 4.3% and 12.9% of MDS cases, respectively, where deregulated iron metabolism has been implicated in the development of refractory anaemia23. With such high mutation frequencies and specificity, the SF3B1 mutations were thought to be almost pathognomonic to these MDS subtypes characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, and strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS in these categories. Less conspicuously but significantly, SRSF2 mutations were more frequent in CMML cases (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Thus, although commonly involving the E/A splicing complexes, different mutations may still have different impacts on cell functions, contributing to the determination of discrete disease phenotypes. For example, studies have demonstrated that SRSF2 was also involved in the regulation of DNA stability and that depletion of SRSF2 can lead to genomic instability24. Of interest in this context, regardless of disease subtypes, samples with SRSF2 mutations were shown to have significantly more mutations of other genes compared with U2AF35 mutations (P 5 0.001, multiple regression analysis) (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, with a rare exception of A26V in a single case, the mutations of U2AF35 exclusively involved two highly conserved amino acid positions (S34 or Q157) within the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger motifs flanking the U2AF homology motif (UHM) domain. SRSF2 mutations exclusively occurred at P95 within an intervening sequence between the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and arginine/ serine-rich (RS) domains (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs 8 and 9). Similarly, SF3B1 mutations predominantly involved K700 and, to a lesser extent, K666, H662 and E622, which are also conserved across species (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 10). The involvement of recurrent amino acid positions in these spliceosome genes strongly indicated a gain-of-function nature of these mutations, which has been a welldocumented scenario in other oncogenic mutations25. On the other hand, the 23 mutations in ZRSR2 (Xp22.1) were widely distributed along the entire coding region (Fig. 2). Among these, 14 mutations were nonsense or frameshift changes, or involved splicing donor/acceptor sites that caused either a premature truncation or a large structural change of the protein, leading to loss-of-function. Combined with their strong male preference for the mutation (14/14 cases), ZRSR2 most likely acts as a tumour suppressor gene with an X-linked recessive mode of genetic action. The remaining nine ZRSR2 mutations were missense changes and found in both males (six cases) and females (three cases), whose somatic origin was only confirmed in two cases. However, neither the dbSNP database (build131 and 132) nor the 1000 Genomes database (May 2011 snp calls) contained these missense nucleotides, suggesting that many, if not all, of these missense changes are likely to represent functional somatic changes, especially those found in males. Interrogation of these hot spots for mutations in U2AF35 and SRSF2 found no mutations among lymphoid neoplasms, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (N 5 24) or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (N 5 87) (data not shown). RNA splicing and spliceosome mutations Because the splicing pathway mutations in myelodysplasia widely and specifically affect the major components of the splicing complexes E/A in a mutually exclusive manner, the common consequence of these mutations is logically the impaired recognition of 39SSs that would lead to the production of aberrantly spliced mRNA species. To appreciate this and also to gain an insight into the biological/biochemical impact of these splicing mutations, we expressed the wild-type and the mutant (S34F) U2AF35 in HeLa cells using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) marking (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Methods III) and examined their effects on gene expression in these cells using GeneChip Human genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix), followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Supplementary Methods IV)26. Intriguingly, the GSEA disclosed a significant enrichment of the genes on the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway among the significantly upregulated genes in mutant U2AF35-transduced HeLa cells (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 11a and Supplementary Table 7), which was SRSF2 (0.7%) PRPF40B (0.7%) SF3A1 (0.7%) Dup (0.7%) U2AF35 (1.9%) SRSF2 (1.9%) ZRSR2 (1.9%) PRPF40B (1.9%) SF1 (1.9%) MDS without RS (N = 155) RARS / RCMD-RS (N = 73) CMML (N = 88) De novo AML (N = 151) MPN (N = 53) b RARS/RCMD-RS CMML AML/MDS De novo AML MPN a ZR AML/MDS (N = 62) No mut (90.6%) U2AF35  (11.6%) SRSF2 (11.6%) ZRSR2 (7.7%) SF3B1 (6.5%) No mut (56.1%) SF3B1 (75.3%) No mut (15.1%) SRSF2 (5.5%) U2AF35  (8.0%) SRSF2 (28.4%) ZRSR2 (8.0%) SF3B1 (4.5%) SF3A1 (1.3% ) PRPF40B (1.9%) U2AF65 (0.6%) SF1 (1.3%) Dup (1.3%) Dup (2.7%) ZRSR2 (1.4%) Dup (3.4%) U2AF65 (1.1%) SF3A1 (1.1% ) No mut (74.2%) U2AF35  (9.7%) SRSF2  (6.5%) ZRSR2 (1.6%) SF3B1 (4.8%) SF3A1 (1.6% ) PRPF40B (1.6% ) No mut (93.4%) U2AF35 (1.3%) SF3B1 (2.6%) No mut (45.5%) MDS without RS SF3B1 SRSF2 U2AF35 ZRSR2 SF3A1 PRPF40B U2AF65 SF1 Figure 3 | Frequencies and distribution of spliceosome pathway gene mutations in myeloid neoplasms. a, Frequencies of spliceosome pathway mutations among 582 cases with various myeloid neoplasms. b, Distribution of mutations in eight spliceosome genes, where diagnosis of each sample is shown by indicated colours.

All rights reserved confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Methods 5V). A similar result was also observed for the gene expression profile of an MDS-derived cell line (TF-1) transduced with the S34F mutant (Supplementary Figs 11b, c). The NMD activation by themutant U2AF35was suppressed significantly by the cooverexpression of the wild-type protein (Supplementary Fig. 11d), indicating that the effect of the mutant protein was likely to be mediated by inhibition of thefunctions of the wild-type protein. Given that the NMD pathway, known as mRNA surveillance, provides a post-transcriptional mechanism for recognizing and eliminating abnormal transcripts that prematurely terminate translation27, the result of the GSEA analyses indicated that the mutant U2AF35 induced abnormal RNA splicing in HeLa and TF-1 cells, leading to the generation of unspliced RNA species having a premature stop codon and induction of the NMD activity. To confirm this, we next performed whole transcriptome analysis in these cells using the GeneChip Human exon 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix), in which we differentially tracked the behaviour of two discrete sets of probes showing different level of evidence of being exons, that is, ‘Core’ (authentic exons) and ‘non-Core’ (more likely introns) sets (Supplementary Methods IV and Supplementary Fig. 12). As shown in Fig. 4d, the Core and non-Core set probes were differentially enriched among probes showing significant difference in expression between wild-type and mutant-transduced cells (false discovery rate (FDR) 5 0.01). The Core set probes were significantly enriched in those probes significantly downregulated in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells compared with wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, whereas the non-Core set probes were enriched in those probes significantly upregulated in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4e). The significant differential enrichment was also demonstrated, even when all probe sets were included (Fig. 4f). Moreover, the significantly differentially expressed Core set probes tended to be up- and downregulated in wild-type and mutant U2AF35-transduced cells compared with mock-transduced cells, respectively, and vice versa for the differentially expressed non-Core set probes (Fig. 4e). Combined, these exon array results indicated that the wild-type U2AF35 correctly promoted authentic RNA splicing, whereas the mutant U2AF35 inhibited this processes, rendering non-Core and therefore, more likely intronic sequences to remain unspliced. The abnormal splicing in mutantU2AF35-transduced cells was more directly demonstrated by sequencing mRNAs extracted from HeLa cells, in which expression of the wild-type and mutant (S34F) U2AF35 were induced by doxycycline. First, after adjusting by the total number of mapped reads, the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells showed an increased read counts in the exon fraction, but reduced counts in other fractions, compared with mutant U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4g). The reads from the mutant-transduced cells were mapped to broader genomic regions compared with those from the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, which were largely explained by non-exon reads (Fig. 4h). Finally, the number of those reads that encompassed the authentic exon/intron junctions was significantly increased in mutantU2AF35-transduced cells compared withwild-type U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4i and Supplementary Methods VI). These results clearly demonstrated that failure of splicing ubiquitously occurred in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells. A typical example of abnormal splicing in mutant-transduced cells and the list of significantly unspliced exons are shown in Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 8, respectively. Biological consequence of U2AF35 mutations Finally, we examined the biological effects of compromised functions of the E/A splicing complexes. First, TF-1 and HeLa cells were transduced with lentivirus constructs expressing either the S34F U2AF35 mutant or wild-type U2AF35 under a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Figs 14a and 15a), and cell proliferation was examined after the induction of their expression. Unexpectedly, after the induction of gene expression with doxycycline, the mutant U2AF35-transduced cells, but not the wildtype U2AF35-transduced cells, showed reduced cell proliferation (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 15b) with a marked increase in the G2/M fraction (G2/M arrest) together with enhanced apoptosis as a 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.5 2.5 0.5 SMG5 DHX34 UPF1 SMG1 UPF3B BTZ UPF2 SMG7 SMG6 * * * * * * * * * 3.0 Mock S34F U2AF35  P < 0.01 (n = 5) b d 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 P = 0.0026 0.0 SMG5 SMG9 DHX34 UPF1 SMG1 UPF3B BTZ UPF2 SMG7 MAGOH SMG6 SMG8 Y14 eIF4A3 PYM UPF3A hNAG WT S34F Mock S34F WT U2AF35 AntiU2AF35 AntiFlag Anti- β actin HeLa S34F MockWT Normalized intensity S34F WT 10–1 10–3 101 100 10–2 S34F Mock Normalized intensity Enrichment score U2AF35 Hits cNormalized expression e f S.I.

To confirm the growth-suppressive effect of U2AF35 mutants in vitro, a highly purified haematopoietic stem cell population (CD342cKit1ScaI1Lin2, CD342KSL) prepared from C57BL/6 (B6)-Ly5.1 mouse bone marrow28 was retrovirally transduced with either the mutant (S34F, Q157P and Q157R) or wild-type U2AF35, or the mock constructs, each harbouring the EGFP marker gene (Supplementary Fig. 16). The ability of these transduced cells to reconstitute the haematopoietic system was tested in a competitive reconstitution assay. The transduced cells were mixed with whole bone marrow cells from B6-Ly5.1/5.2 F1 mice, transplanted into lethally irradiated B6-Ly5.2 recipients, and peripheral blood chimaerism derived from EGFPpositive cellswasassessed6 weeks after transplantation byflow cytometry. We confirmed that each recipient mouse received comparable numbers of EGFP-positive cells among the different retrovirus groups by estimating the percentage of EGFP-positive cells and overall proliferation in transduced cells by ex vivo tracking. Also no significant difference was observed in their homing capacity to bone marrow as assessed by transwell migration assays (Supplementary Fig. 17). As shown in Fig. 5e, the wild-typeU2AF35-transduced cells showed a slightly higher reconstitution capacity than the mock-transduced cells. On the other hand, the recipients of the cells transduced with the various U2AF35 mutants showed significantly lower EGFP-positive cell chimaerism than those of either the mock- or the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, indicating a compromised reconstitution capacity of the haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells expressing the U2AF35 mutants. In summary, these mutants lead to loss-of-function of U2AF35 most probably by acting in a dominant-negative fashion to the wild-type protein. Discussion Our whole-exome sequencing study unexpectedly unmasked a complexity of novel pathway mutations found in approximately 45% to 85% of myelodysplasia patients depending on the disease subtypes, which affected multiple but distinctive components of the splicing machinery and, as such, demonstrated the unquestionable power of massively parallel sequencing technologies in cancer research. The RNA splicing system comprises essential cellular machinery, through which eukaryotes can achieve successful transcription and guarantee the functional diversity of their protein species using alternative splicing in the face of a limited number of genes29. Accordingly, the meticulous regulation of this machinery should be indispensable for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis30, deregulation of which causes severe developmental abnormalities31,32. The current discovery of frequent mutations of the splicing pathway in myelodysplasia, therefore, represents another remarkable example that illustrates how cancer develops by targeting critical cellular functions. It also provides an intriguing insight into the mechanism of ‘cancer specific’ alternative splicing, which have long been implicated in the development of cancer, including MDS and other haematopoietic neoplasms33,34. In myelodysplasia, the major targets of spliceosome mutations seemed to be largely confined to the components of the E/A splicing complex, among others to SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF35 and ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent, to SF3A1, SF1, U2AF65 and PRPF40B. The broad coverage of the wide spectrum of spliceosome components in our exome sequencing was likely to preclude frequent involvement of other components on this pathway (Supplementary Fig. 18). The surprising frequency and specificity of these mutations in this complex, together with the mutually exclusive manner they occurred, unequivocally indicate that the compromised function of the E/A complex is a hallmark of this unique category of myeloid neoplasms, playing a central role in the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia. The close relationship between the mutation types and unique disease subtypes also support their pivotal roles in MDS. Given the critical functions of the E/A splicing complex on the precise 39SS recognition, the logical consequence of these relevant mutations would be the impaired splicing involving diverse RNA species. In fact, when expressed in HeLa cells, the mutant U2AF35 induced global abnormalities of RNA splicing, leading to increased production of transcripts having unspliced intronic sequences. On the other hand, the functional link between the abnormal splicing of RNA species and the phenotype of myelodysplasia is still unclear. Mutant U2AF35 seemed to suppress cell growth/proliferation and induce apoptosis rather than confer a growth advantage or promote clonal selection. ZRSR2 knockdown in HeLa cells has been reported to also result in reduced viability, arguing for the common consequence of these pathway mutations35. These observations suggested that the oncogenic actions of these splicing pathway mutations are distinct from what is expected for classical oncogenes, such as mutated kinases and signal transducers, but could be more related to cell differentiation. Of note in this regard, the commonest clinical presentation of MDS is severe cytopenia in multiple cell lineages due to ineffective haematopoiesis with increased apoptosis rather than unlimited cell proliferation1 . In this regard, lessons may be learned from the recent findings on the pathogenesis of the 5q2 syndrome, where haploinsufficiency of RPS14 leads to increased apoptosis of erythroid progenitors, but not myeloproliferation36,37.

All rights reserved pathogenesis of MDS, where the broad spectrum of RNA species affected by impaired splicing hampers identification of responsible gene targets. Moreover, the mutated components of the splicing machinery have distinct function of their own other than direct regulation of RNA splicing, involved in elongation and DNA stability, which may be important to determine specific disease phenotypes. Clearly, more studies are required to answer these questions through understanding of the molecular basis of their oncogenic actions. METHODS SUMMARY Whole-exome sequencing of paired tumour/normal DNA samples from the 29 patients was performed after informed consent was obtained. SNP array-based copy number analysis was performed as previously described17,18. Mutation analysis of the splicing pathway genes in a set of 582 myeloid neoplasms were performed by first screening mutations in PCR-amplified pooled targets from 12 individuals, followed by validation/identification of the candidate mutations within the corresponding 12 individuals by Sanger sequencing. Flag-tagged cDNAs of the wild-type and mutant U2AF35 were generated by in vitro mutagenesis, constructed into a murine stem cell virus-based retroviral vector as well as a tetracycline-inducible lentivirus-based expression vector, and used for gene transfer to CD342KSL cells and cultured cell lines, with EGFP marking, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from wild-type or mutant U2AF35-transduced HeLa and TF-1 cells, and analysed on microarrays. RNA sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Cell proliferation assays (MTT assays) on HeLa and TF-1 cells stably transduced with lentivirus U2AF35 constructs were performed in the presence or absence of doxycycline. For competitive reconstitution assays, CD342KSL cells collected from C57BL/6 (B6)- Ly5.1 mice were retrovirally transduced with various U2AF35 constructs with EGFP marking, and transplanted with competitor cells (B6-Ly5.1/5.2 F1 mouse origin) into lethally irradiated B6-Ly5.2 mice 48 h after gene transduction. Frequency of EGFP-positive cells was assessed in peripheral blood by flow cytometry 6 weeks after the transplantation (Supplementary MethodsVII). The primer sets used for validation of gene mutations and qPCR of NMD gene expression are listed in Supplementary Tables 9211.

135||Mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in RNA splicing have been found to occur at relatively high frequencies in several tumour types including myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, uveal melanoma, and pancreatic cancer, and at lower frequencies in breast cancer. To investigate whether dysfunction in RNA splicing is implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, we performed a re-analysis of published exome and whole genome sequencing data. This analysis revealed that mutations in spliceosomal component genes occurred in 5.6% of unselected breast cancers, including hotspot mutations in the SF3B1 gene, which were found in 1.8% of unselected breast cancers. SF3B1 mutations were significantly associated with ER-positive disease, AKT1 mutations, and distinct copy number alterations. Additional profiling of hotspot mutations in a panel of special histological subtypes of breast cancer showed that 16% and 6% of papillary and mucinous carcinomas of the breast harboured the SF3B1 K700E mutation. RNA sequencing identified differentially spliced events expressed in tumours with SF3B1 mutations including the protein coding genes TMEM14C, RPL31, DYNL11, UQCC, and ABCC5, and the long non-coding RNA CRNDE. Moreover, SF3B1 mutant cell lines were found to be sensitive to the SF3b complex inhibitor spliceostatin A and treatment resulted in perturbation of the splicing signature. Albeit rare, SF3B1 mutations result in alternative splicing events, and may constitute drivers and a novel therapeutic target in a subset of breast cancers. © 2014 The Authors.

Keywords: breast cancer, next-generation sequencing, drivers, SF3B1, alternative splicing, spliceostatin A Go to: Introduction The ability to characterize entire genomes at base pair resolution using massively parallel sequencing technologies provides a unique opportunity to unravel genotypic–phenotypic associations in breast cancer, which can be exploited for the identification of drivers of tumourigenesis and, ultimately, therapeutic targets. Recent breast cancer sequencing studies have highlighted the complex nature of the landscape of breast cancer genomes, characterizing both the mutational signatures of breast cancer [1–3] and their mutational repertoire [4–8]. These seminal studies have highlighted that there are a few highly recurrent mutations in breast cancer, including TP53 and PIK3CA, and a wide spectrum of genes mutated in a small minority of tumours. However, some of the low-frequency mutations (i.e. present in 0.5–2%) of breast cancers constitute bona fide drivers and therapeutic targets in other cancer types, such as BRAF and KRAS activating hotspot mutations [6].  In addition to known drivers, massively parallel sequencing studies have resulted in the identification of novel mutations in multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery. Somatic mutations affecting different spliceosomal component genes are preferentially found in myeloid neoplasms showing features of myelodysplasia (MDS) and seemingly occur in a mutually exclusive manner [9]. In fact, mutations in the splicing factor 3B subunit 1 gene (SF3B1) are rather prevalent in MDS and found to be associated with a distinct phenotype (i.e. the presence of ring sideroblasts) and favourable clinical outcome [10,11]. Mutations in other splicing genes, such as the U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 gene (U2AF1), the serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 gene (SRSF2), and the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor 35 kDa subunit-related protein 2 gene (ZRSR2), have also been reported; however, these are less frequent and not associated with ring sideroblasts in MDS patients [9,10]. More recently, studies have identified mutations in SF3B1 in subsets of solid tumours from multiple anatomic sites (see ref 11 for a recent review), including 15% of chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (CLLs) [12], 9.7% of uveal melanomas [13], 4% of pancreatic cancers [14], and 1.8% of breast cancers [4–6,8]. Although these mutations have been shown to result in phenotypic changes exemplified by their impact on RNA splicing events in CLLs and uveal melanomas, their impact on outcome seems to vary according to tumour type. Whilst in patients with CLL these mutations are associated with a poor outcome, in patients with uveal melanoma, SF3B1 mutations are reported to be associated with a good prognosis [12,13,15,16].  Given that mutations affecting spliceosomal component genes have been reported in multiple tumour types, including breast cancer, and may constitute driver events in a subset of cancers, we performed a systematic re-analysis of publicly available exome, whole genome, and RNA sequencing data available for breast cancers. Our aims were to determine whether mutations affecting spliceosomal component genes are associated with specific breast cancer subtypes and, if present, whether these mutations were associated with distinct splicing events and would constitute targets for therapy in these tumours.  Go to: Materials and methods Re-analysis of publicly available whole genome and exome massively parallel sequencing datasets  Exome and whole genome sequencing data for 1293 tumours were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other published studies [3–8]. Processed variant calls reported in these studies were annotated using the Ensembl Variant effect predictor [17] and mutational gene frequencies computed. Binary alignment mapping (BAM) files of SF3B1 mutant tumours available in TCGA were used to assess the heterozygosity at the SF3B1 locus using ASCAT [18].  Tumour samples  Representative frozen or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from 65 breast cancers classified as papillary (n = 19), mucinous (n = 18), and micropapillary (n = 28) carcinomas were retrieved from the authors' institutions and surveyed for the presence of the SF3B1 K700E hotspot mutation (Supplementary Table 1). All cases were reviewed by at least two pathologists (CM, AS, AV-S, and/ or JSR-F) prior to their inclusion in this study. This study was approved by the authors' local research ethics committees. Analyses were performed anonymously.  Immunohistochemistry  Representative sections of each case were cut at 3 µm and mounted on silane-coated slides. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described [19,20], using antibodies raised against oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Antibody clones, dilution, antigen retrieval methods, scoring systems, and cut-offs are summarised in Supplementary Table 2. Positive and negative (omission of the primary antibody and IgG-matched serum) controls were included for each immunohistochemical run. The scoring was performed by at least two pathologists (CM, AS, AV-S, and/ or JSR-F).  Nucleic acid extraction  DNA and/or RNA were extracted after gross dissection of representative frozen or FFPE tissue blocks to ensure that the samples contained more than 60% tumour cells [21,22] (Supplementary methods). RNA quantity and quality were assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only samples with an RNA integrity number (RIN) greater than 6 were used for RNA-sequencing library construction.  Copy number analysis  Normalised circular binary segmented (cbs) SNP6 data were retrieved from TCGA for available SF3B1 mutant and wild-type tumours, matched on a 1 : 2 ratio for ER, PR, HER2 status, and PIK3CA and TP53 mutational status (Supplementary Table 3). SNP6 copy number data were converted into categorical values by applying thresholds as previously described and subjected to a multi-Fisher exact test with adjustment for multiple testing [23].  Targeted re-sequencing  Targeted DNA sequencing of ten recurrently mutated genes identified in SF3B1 mutated (n = 3) and wild-type (n = 16) breast cancers was performed using the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq technology according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) (Supplementary methods and Supplementary Table 4). Libraries were amplified using 10 ng of DNA per primer pool using the IT AmpliSeq 2.0 kit and sequenced on two 318 chips at a median depth of more than 1000. The Torrent Suite v4.0.2 pipeline was used to align raw reads and identify variants.  Paired-end massively parallel RNA sequencing  RNA sequencing was performed using 16 ng of ribosomal-depleted RNA of 14 papillary carcinomas of the breast (three SF3B1 mutant and 11 SF3B1 wild-type) (Supplementary methods). Four indexed samples were pooled at equimolar concentrations and sequenced on a single lane of a HiSeq 2500 using SBS v3 chemistry (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) (2 × 76 cycles). Samples were aligned to the human genome (hg19 build 37) using TopHat version 2.0.8b. Raw counts of reads mapped to genes were calculated using HT-Seq (http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/overview.html) and used as input for differential exon usage analysis using DEXSeq [24], with an adjusted p-value cut-off of ≤0.1. FASTQ files from available TCGA RNA-sequencing data from SF3B1 K700E mutant (n = 8) and ER, PR, HER2 status, and PIK3CA and TP53 mutational status, and randomly matched controls (n = 16) were downloaded from the Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub; https://cghub.ucsc.edu) and processed as above (TCGA project access number 6223).  Raw targeted re-sequencing and RNA-sequencing data have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and are available under accession numbers PRJNA234087 and PRJNA229096.  Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), PCR, and Sanger sequencing validation  Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript III (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) using 50 ng of RNA per reaction. SF3B1 K700E mutations were screened by PCR and RT-PCR using KAPA Taq DNA Polymerase (KAPA Biosystems, MA, USA) and sequenced as previously described [22]. Sequences were visualized using 4Peaks (http://4peaks.en.softonic.com/). Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 5.  Splice variant analysis by quantitative PCR  Primers were designed against predicted alternatively spliced exons using Primer 3 (http://primer3.ut.ee) and retrieved from Furney et al [13] (Supplementary Table 5). 1 ng of cDNA was analysed in duplicate to quantify spliced and unspliced forms by real-time quantitative PCR [13]. Briefly, 40 cycles of quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) were conducted in 384-well plates using Power SYBR Green reagents (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) on the ABI 9700HT. The relative abundance of the spliced to unspliced form was calculated using 2−(CT variant1 mRNA – CT variant2 mRNA). For each splicing event, a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test was applied between SF3B1 mutated (n = 3) and wild-type (n = 11) cases.  Cell line models  Pancreatic Panc 05.04, PANC-1, Capan-1, Capan-2, and endometrial cancer cell lines ESS-1, MFE296, HEC1A, and HEC59 were obtained from ATCC (LGC Standards, UK) and DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) and maintained according to recommended growth conditions. The identity of cell lines was confirmed by short tandem repeat (STR) typing using the GenePrint 10 Kit (Promega, UK). SF3B1 mutant cell lines were identified through COSMIC (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) and verified by means of Sanger sequencing using the methods and primers described above.  Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing  SF3B1 plus eight genes that were consistently differentially spliced in SF3B1 mutant versus wild-type samples – namely ABCC5, ANKHD1, DYNLL1, F8, RPL31, TMEM14C, UQCC, and CRNDE – were selected for functional evaluation. Splice variant specific siRNAs were designed to differentially spliced genes that showed large enough unique regions to allow targeting of three or more independent oligos (Supplementary Table 5). Cells were transfected with target and control siRNAs in 96-well plates, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Panc 05.04) or Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen). Cell viability was assessed 6–8 days post-transfection as previously described [25], using the CellTiter-Glo® assay (Promega, UK). The cell survival fraction for each siRNA was calculated using the normalised percentage inhibition (NPI) as previously described [26]. Validation of target gene knockdown was performed using qRT-PCR using the delta-delta CT method. Experiments were performed in triplicate.  Drug sensitivity assays  Cell lines were plated in 96-well plates and 24 h later, media were supplemented with serial dilutions (10−5–10−9 m) of spliceostatin A (SSA) (Bioquote, York, UK). All experiments were performed in triplicate. Survival was assessed with the CellTiter-Glo® cell viability assay after 7 days of drug treatment. Survival curves and estimated SF50 (the drug concentration used following which 50% of cells survive) were calculated using non-linear regression with GraphPad Prism V5.0.  Statistical analyses  Fisher's exact tests using all collated mutation data were used to determine association of co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity between variables as previously described [27]. The Mann–Whitney U-test and Student's t-test were employed to compare the mean expression of alternatively spliced exons between SF3B1 wild-type and mutant tumours, and between drug- and DMSO-treated cells. p values less than 0.05 (two-sided) were considered statistically significant.  Go to: Results SF3B1 mutations are associated with ER-positive breast cancer  A systematic re-analysis of exome and whole genome sequencing data from TCGA and other published studies [3–8] identified recurrent mutations in distinct spliceosomal component genes previously reported in other tumour types (Figure 1A, Table Table1,1, and Supplementary Table 6) [9,12,28,29]. Some mutations in spliceosome genes appeared to be mutually exclusive, including SF3B1 and PRPF8, and SF3B1 and SON (odds ratio = 0, p < 0.05, Fisher's exact test). Coincident spliceosome mutations were also identified in SF3B1 and LUC7L2, and in LUC7L2 and SAP130 in two patients (Figure 1A). Although not significant, mutations in LUC7L2 and SAP130 showed a trend towards co-occurrence (odds ratio = 2.883, p = 0.9434, Fisher's exact test). Of the most common spliceosome gene mutations (overall frequency > 0.5%), mutations in SF3B1 were more common in ER-positive breast cancer (2.2%, 21/936 ER-positive versus 0.3%, 1/289 ER-negative, p = 0.03914, Fisher's exact test) and mutations in SAP130 were more common in ER-negative tumours (0.1%, 1/936 ER-positive versus 1.4%, 4/289 ER-negative, p = 0.012, Fisher's exact test). Overall, mutations in SF3B1 were the most common spliceosomal component gene mutation and were identified in 1.8% of unselected breast cancers (23/1293), and occurred as a recurrent hotspot T > C base-pair substitution at codon 700, leading to a glutamic acid from lysine (K700E) in 74% (17/23) of mutant cases (Figure 1B and Table Table1).1). Additional recurrent mutations in SF3B1 occurred at codon 666 (K666Q and K666E) in 9% of mutant tumours (2/23), and non-recurrent mutations included G241*, N626D, A633V, Y765C, and D781E, which were found in 22% (5/23; Supplementary Table 6). None of mutations were associated with loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type allele (data not shown).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Repertoire of mutations in genes involved in mRNA splicing in breast cancer. (A) Summary of the mutations identified in genes involved in mRNA splicing. Genes are listed on the right-hand side of the diagram and the breast cancer samples across the top. ... Table 1 Table 1 Summary of spliceosome component mutational frequencies from the re-analysis of public sequencing data (n = 1293 tumours*) SF3B1 mutations are associated with specific genomic alterations  A comparison of the genomic features of SF3B1 K700E mutant tumours with available phenotypic information (n = 16) with those of stage, ER, PR, HER2, PIK3CA, and TP53 mutation status-matched SF3B1 K700E wild-type tumours (n = 32; Supplementary Table 3) revealed that SF3B1 K700E mutant tumours displayed a higher frequency of chromosomal gains on 16q12–q13 and 16q21–q22 and losses on 1p36–p35, 16q11–q13, and 16q21–q23 (adjusted p < 0.05, multi-Fisher's exact test). These observations suggest that SF3B1 K700E mutant tumours have a distinct repertoire of copy number alterations (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 7). No differences in the frequency of amplifications between SF3B1 K700E mutant and wild-type tumours were detected. Although no difference was seen in the total number of somatic coding mutations between SF3B1 K700E mutant and wild-type samples (p = 0.597, t-test; SF3B1 K700E mutant average 23.3, range 9–59; SF3B1 wild-type average 25.59, range 1–85), 56.3% (9/16) of the SF3B1 mutant samples also carried PIK3CA mutations, while mutations in TP53 were not as prevalent (6.3%, Figure 1C). In addition, AKT1 hotspot E17K mutations were found to be significantly more frequent in SF3B1 K700E mutated tumours (4/16) than in matched wild-type cancers (0/32, p = 0.009353, Fisher's exact test). Interestingly, 2 out of 24 (8.3%) mucinous carcinomas of the breast annotated in the data were identified as having SF3B1 K700E mutations and lacked mutations in additional significantly mutated genes or known cancer genes (Figure 1C).  SF3B1 K700E mutations are more common in ER-positive special histological types of breast cancer  Given the apparent association of SF3B1 mutations with mucinous carcinomas of the breast, we screened additional cohorts of ER-positive special histological types of breast cancer for SF3B1 K700E mutations. Mucinous (n = 18), papillary (n = 19), and micropapillary (n = 28) carcinomas were subjected to Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Table 1). K700E mutations were identified in 6% (1/18), 16% (3/19), and 0% (0/28) of mucinous, papillary, and micropapillary carcinomas, respectively. These mutations were expressed at the RNA level in all papillary carcinomas tested, where matched RNA was available. Although the small number of cases subjected to SF3B1 mutation profiling could have resulted in a type I or α error resulting in a higher frequency of mutations than the mutation rate in unselected breast cancers, the probability of finding three samples harbouring an SF3B1 mutation by chance is less than 0.5% (based on a binomial distribution assuming a mutation rate of 1.8% in unselected breast cancers).  Given the higher frequency of SF3B1 K700E mutations in papillary carcinomas of the breast, we hypothesised that these mutations may underpin their biology and may be present at additional hotspots and/or be sub-clonal in the ‘wild-type’ samples. To address these questions, the 19 papillary carcinomas were subjected to targeted DNA re-sequencing of SF3B1 exons 14–16 and of nine additional genes, which are recurrently mutated in ER-positive breast cancers harbouring SF3B1 mutations and have been postulated as drivers [5]. This analysis failed to identify additional or sub-clonal SF3B1 mutations in the 16 papillary carcinomas that had been shown be SF3B1 wild-type by Sanger sequencing analysis. Overall, 63% (12/19) of the samples were found to display mutations in additional cancer genes including PIK3CA in 37% (7/19), TP53 in 5% (1/19), GATA3 in 11% (2/19), MAP3K1 11% (2/19), and MAP3K4 in 21% (4/19) (Figure 1D and Supplementary Table 8). In contrast to SF3B1 mutant unselected breast cancers, no papillary carcinomas in this series were found to harbour AKT1 hotspot mutations.  SF3B1 K700E mutations are associated with differential splicing  Given the previous association of SF3B1 mutations with differential splicing in uveal melanoma [13], we hypothesised that SF3B1 K700E mutations in breast cancer would also lead to differential splicing. Massively parallel RNA sequencing of SF3B1 mutant (n = 3) versus wild-type (n = 11) papillary carcinomas of the breast identified differential exon usage in 122 transcripts (p < 0.1 FDR, Supplementary Table 9). In addition, re-analysis of available RNA-sequencing data of (n = 8) SF3B1 K700E mutant and stage, ER, PR, HER2, PIK3CA, and TP53 mutation status-matched SF3B1 wild-type breast cancers (n = 16) from TCGA revealed differential exon usage in 218 transcripts (p < 0.1 FDR, Supplementary Table 10). Nine of these genes were found to be in common, and seven showed exact differential exon usage (TMEM14C, RPL31, CRNDE, DYNLL1, ICA1, RPL24, and MTERFD3, p = 2.988529e-14, hypergeometric test, Table Table2).2). In addition, four transcripts (ie TMEM14C, RPL31, CRNDE, and DYNLL1) were found in common with uveal melanoma [13] (p = 7.047575e-11, hypergeometric test) and these showed identical differential splicing in papillary carcinomas of the breast, invasive breast carcinomas of no special type, and uveal melanomas displaying SF3B1 mutations (Figure 2 and Table Table22).  Table 2 Table 2 Alternative gene splicing associated with SF3B1 mutations in breast cancer Figure 2 Figure 2 Identification of differential splicing in SF3B1 mutant (n = 3) and wild-type (n = 11) papillary carcinomas of the breast. Plots of normalised RNA-sequencing reads for (A) CRNDE, (B) TMEM14C, and (C) RPL31 in SF3B1 wild-type (blue) and SF3B1 mutant (red) ... We next additionally tested alternative splicing of seven genes shown to be differentially spliced from Furney et al [13] (GUSBP11, UQCC, ANKHD1, GAS8, F8, ADAM12, and ABCC5) using qRT-PCR in SF3B1 mutant and wild-type papillary carcinomas. This analysis identified UQCC, F8, ABCC5, and GUSBP11 to be differentially spliced in papillary carcinomas, whereas GAS8 and ADAM12 showed no difference (Supplementary Figure 2). Our results suggest that SF3B1 mutations are associated with alternative splicing of key genes in ER-positive breast cancer that are independent of tumour type.  SF3B1 mutant cells are sensitive to SF3b inhibition  Based on our observations that SF3B1 mutant tumours display a conserved splicing signature, we posited that differential splicing of the downstream targets may drive tumour growth. Treatment of two SF3B1 mutant cell lines, Panc 05.04 (pancreatic, K700E) and ESS-1 (endometrial, K666N), and six wild-type controls (three pancreatic and three endometrial) with an SF3b complex inhibitor, spliceostatin A, revealed that SF3B1 mutant cell lines were significantly more sensitive to this agent (p = 0.0118, t-test, Figure 3A). Moreover, treatment with spliceostatin A resulted in significant perturbation of the splicing signature, in a similar manner to SF3B1 siRNA-mediated knockdown (Figure 3C). In addition, siRNA-mediated silencing of all transcripts of eight genes that showed a consistent differential splicing signature across multiple cancer types (ABCC5, ANKHD1, DYNLL1, F8, RPL31, TMEM14C, UQCC, and CRNDE) failed to reveal differences in cell viability (Figure 3C). In addition, silencing of specific splice variants of CRNDE failed to identify any SF3B1 mutant-specific effects (Figures 3D and and3E).3E). These results suggest that SF3B1 mutations are likely driving the malignant phenotype of the cells through perturbations in RNA splicing; however, this driving effect could not be ascribed to a single differentially spliced transcript tested.  Figure 3 Figure 3 SF3B1 mutant cells are sensitive to SF3b inhibition. (A) Dose–response curves of SF3B1 mutant cancer cell lines (red) or wild-type (blue) to the SF3b complex inhibitor spliceostatin A (p = 0.0118, t-test). (B) Bar plots of the relative expression ... Taken together, our findings demonstrate that although SF3B1 mutations are unlikely to account for the histological characteristics of papillary carcinomas of the breast, these mutations affect mRNA splicing and likely constitute driver genetic events.  Go to: Discussion Here we describe the repertoire of mutations in spliceosomal components in breast cancer through a re-analysis of public exome and whole genome sequencing data. Our data reveal that some spliceosome mutations are mutually exclusive in breast cancer, consistent with the observations made in myelodysplastic lesions [9]; however, a small proportion of tumours harboured mutations in more than one spliceosome component. Moreover, we demonstrate that SF3B1 is the most commonly mutated spliceosomal component gene in breast cancer and that mutations affecting this gene are significantly associated with ER-positive disease. In addition, SF3B1 mutations are found to be associated with specific genomic alterations including concurrent AKT1 hotspot mutations and a lower frequency of the hallmark chromosomal aberrations reported in ER-positive IC-NST (ie loss of 16q) akin to mucinous carcinomas of the breast [23]. Our exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis of special histological types of breast cancer provides evidence to suggest that the codon 700 SF3B1 hotspot mutations may be more prevalent in mucinous and papillary carcinomas of the breast than in usual types of breast cancer of the same grade, ER, and HER2 status. Targeted re-sequencing of our cohort of 19 papillary carcinomas of the breast failed to identify any sub-clonal mutations in additional tumours, indicating that these mutations, when present, are found in the modal clone of the lesions, but are unlikely to account for the papillary histological pattern.  The SF3B1 gene encodes subunit 1 of splicing factor 3b, a component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, which is involved in catalysing precursor mRNA to mature transcripts. SF3B1 contains several HEAT domains (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, Target of rapamycin 1), which are the hotspots for the majority of the somatic mutations previously documented [10,13,15]. Studies have highlighted that primary tumours with SF3B1 mutations display alternative splicing in selected key genes in CLL [12], MDS [30], and uveal melanoma [13], and that this signature is conserved between cancer sites and is independent of the mutant amino acid [16]. Using a combination of RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR, we identified eight differentially spliced transcripts between mutant SF3B1 and wild-type breast cancers that were also reported to be differentially spliced in SF3B1 mutant melanomas [13], highlighting that this signature is additionally conserved in breast cancer.  Given that the spliceosome SF3b complex has emerged as a potential therapeutic target [31], we sought to define whether cancer models harbouring SF3B1 hotspot mutations would be sensitive to chemical inhibition of SF3B1and RNA-interference silencing of SF3B1 and genes abnormally spliced in SF3B1 mutant tumours [32]. Here we demonstrate that treatment of SF3B1 mutant and wild-type cell lines with spliceostatin A resulted in selective inhibition of the growth of mutant cells and in the disruption of the conserved splicing signature. Interestingly, single gene RNAi-mediated silencing of key differentially spliced genes had no effect on cell viability. Although it is plausible that the differentially spliced genes investigated in this study did not account for the dependency of SF3B1 mutant cells on aberrant splicing, it is conceivable that the differences in pre-mRNA splicing act in concert to produce a cell survival advantage. Given the difficulties in silencing multiple genes systematically, this remains to be tested.  In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that spliceosomal mutations occur in a mutually exclusive manner in breast cancer and that distinct components of the spliceosome are targeted by somatic mutations in different types of breast cancer (eg SF3B1 and SAP130 were found to be preferentially mutated in ER-positive and ER-negative disease, respectively). We have demonstrated that SF3B1 K700E mutations are more frequently found in some special histological types of breast cancer and have provided direct evidence that these are associated with consistent differential splicing patterns in breast cancer. Finally, our study emphasizes the importance of driver genetic alterations found in minor subgroups of breast cancer, given that SF3B1 mutant cells were shown to be selectively sensitive to a potent SF3b complex inhibitor, spliceostatin A, suggesting that inhibition of the spliceosome complex may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with SF3B1 mutations independent of tumour type.  The RNA maturation is an important and complex biological process. It requires several small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that comprise the two forms of spliceosomes. The major form of spliceosome (U2-type) is composed of U1, U2, U4/6 and U5 snRNPs, and catalyzes most splicing events in metazoans.1  Mutations of genes, such as SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent SF1, SF3A1, U2AF2 or PRPF40B, encoding spliceosome compounds have been found to occur at high frequencies in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).2, 3, 4 Subsequently, SF3B1 mutations were also found in solid tumors such as endometrial, lung, bladder, pancreatic and breast carcinomas and cutaneous melanomas.5 We and others also reported that 15–20% of uveal melanoma (UM) carry SF3B1 mutations.6, 7, 8 SF3B1 (splicing factor 3 B subunit 1, also named SF3B155) is a central compound the U2 snRNP complex in direct contact with the branch site of the pre-mRNA. SF3B1 contains 22 HEAT repeats (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, Targets of rapamycin 1). Major hotspots of missense mutations of SF3B1 target one of the HEAT repeats at positions R625, K666 and K700, with variability according to diseases, R625 and K700 mutations being the most prevalent in UM and hematologic disorders, respectively. Prognosis value of these mutations vary according to diseases, SF3B1 mutations are associated with poor outcomes in CLL and favorable outcomes in UM.9 SF3B1 mutations are especially associated with the refractory anemia with excess of ring sideroblasts (RARS), a mild form of MDS with little impact on patient’s survival. Consequences of these mutations on splicing are less clear. Aberrant splicing associated with SF3B1 was reported by two landmark publications.2, 3 However, little overlap was found between MDS and CLL. Furthermore, Harbour et al.6 found no splicing effect of SF3B1 mutations in a series of UM patients analyzed by RNA-seq. By combining exon array and RNA-seq analyzes, we recently reported alternative transcripts of eight genes statistically associated with SF3B1 R625 mutations and linked to various RNA processing mechanisms: alternative terminal exons (UQCC, ADAM12, GAS8), alternative 3′ acceptor splice sites (CRNDE, ANKHD1), alternative cassette exons (GUSBP1), alternative first exon (F8) and intron retention (ABCC5).7  Five of these differential splicing events (CRNDE, GUSBP11, UQCC, ABCC5 and ANKHD1) were most consistently associated with the SF3B1-mutated status. Here we explored whether this splicing signature was also associated with SF3B1 mutations in malignancies other than UM, namely in MDS and CLL.  Series of CLL (26 cases), MDS of various subtypes (48 cases) and UM (87 cases) were assembled. These samples were genotyped for the recurrent mutated genes of the spliceosome, and biological and clinical data were obtained (see Supplementary Table for sample characteristics). After RNA extraction and reverse transcription, samples were analyzed for the two splice forms of UQCC, CRNDE, ANKHD1, GUSBP1 and ABCC5 by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) as described previously.7 CRNDE was poorly expressed in CLL, below the detection sensitivity of the RT-QPCR in most cases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied on the splicing ratio of the five expressed genes obtained for the series of MDS and CLL data, as well as with that of the series of UM previously reported.7 Whereas no disease aggregation was observed in the clustering, all SF3B1-mutated samples clustered in a single branch (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table for complete sample status). More specifically, this group of samples included 8 CLL SF3B1-mutated samples (K700E (6), K666T (1) and G742D (1)), 24 MDS SF3B1-mutated sample cases (K700E (14), H622Q (4), D781G (2), R625L/H/D/C (4)) and 19 SF3B1-mutated UM samples (R625H/C/L/P (16), K666M/T (2), K700E (1)). As expected, most SF3B1-mutated MDS were classified as RARS or refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (16 and 4, respectively out of 23 cases). No SF3B1-mutated samples were misclassified, except one MDS sample, MDS44 and one UM case, UM48, with low but detectable frequencies of mutated SF3B1 allele, which segregated with wild-type cases. Five cases without detected splicesome mutations (one MDS, two UM and two CLL) clustered in this branch corresponding to the mutated samples. The three SRSF2-mutated MDS cases, bearing the P95H hotspot mutation, segregated in the second branch with the wild-type samples, suggesting that this mutant-splicing factor differently affects the splicing process than the SF3B1 mutants. Two MDS samples bearing ZRSR2 missense mutations of unknown functional consequences (K413E and V304M) segregated each in a different branch.  Figure 1.

An unsupervised hierarchical clustering and a heatmap are performed using the difference in Ct (threshold cycle) between the two splicing forms expression for the five genes, measured by RT-QPCR for a series of 161 tumor samples representing 3 pathologies: uveal melanoma (UM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Data were normalized on mean and standard deviation within each pathology and research center. Clustering was performed based on Euclidian distance by Ward’s method. Splicing status is indicated by color code, representing: WT, wild-type status of the tested spliceosome compounds; SF3B1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2, mutated status of these genes, respectively. NA, not available.  Full figure and legend (124K)  Several conclusions could be drawn from these results. First, it is the first time that consistent splicing abnormalities are associated with SF3B1 mutations. The fact that the same splicing pattern is observed in tumor cells from different lineages and embryonic origins, strongly argues for a direct consequence of SF3B1 mutation. Second, the same pattern is observed irrespective of the mutated HEAT repeats of SF3B1. The reason for different hotspot mutations in different malignancies is largely unexplained but no different consequence was detected in the limited splicing events explored here. Third, the other mutated spliceosome compounds present in our series, including SRSF2 and ZRSR2, did not share the splicing abnormalities of the SF3B1 mutants. Finally, while no false negative was present in the clustering, the splicing pattern of 5 out of 161 samples from the three series was undistinguishable from that of SF3B1 samples, suggesting either experimental limitation of our splicing analysis or undetected abnormalities of the splicing machinery.  Our data clearly associate specific splicing abnormalities to SF3B1 mutations but these abnormalities are most probably not limited to those analyzed here. To statistically demonstrate splicing variants among more than 200 000 different splicing events remains challenging. It requires reliable molecular tools such as the latest generation of exon array or RNA-seq, efficient bioinformatics and large series of cases. It is thus likely that only the most consistent events were picked by the analysis of a limited number of mutated cases. Splicing forms yet to be discovered may better explain the oncogenic pathways activated by mutant SF3B1. Finally, our results do not rule out functions of SF3B1 besides splicing, which deregulations could intervene in oncogenesis.   Graphical Abstract Image for unlabelled figure Figure options  Introduction RNA splicing, a highly regulated molecular event orchestrated by the spliceosome, involves the removal of intronic sequences from pre-mRNA and the ligation of exons to generate mature mRNA (Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009). This process can result in multiple mRNAs being produced from a single gene providing increased protein diversity in cells. Dysregulation of RNA splicing has been identified as a causative defect in several diseases (Dehm, 2013 ;  Singh and Cooper, 2012). Furthermore, dysregulated alternative splicing has been proposed to play an important role in tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy; however, in many cases, the molecular consequences of dysregulated splicing in cancer have remained largely elusive (Zhang and Manley, 2013). Recently, recurrent heterozygous mutations were identified in components of the spliceosome in various tumor types suggesting that somatic mutations in spliceosome genes play an important role in cancer (Yoshida and Ogawa, 2014). SF3B1 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene with particular enrichment in diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, uveal melanoma (UVM), skin melanoma (SKCM), and breast (BRCA) and pancreatic cancers ( Biankin et al., 2012; Ellis et al., 2012; Harbour et al., 2013; Kong et al., 2014; Landau et al., 2013; Malcovati et al., 2015 ;  Yoshida et al., 2011). Based on the high frequency of SF3B1 mutations and the key role in splicing of this protein, we sought to study the molecular and functional consequences of SF3B1 hotspot mutations on RNA splicing in cell lines and patient samples.  Splicing takes place after the recognition of consensus sequences near the 5′ and 3′ ends of introns, known as 5′ and 3′ splice sites (ss), by the splicing machinery. U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) recognizes the 5′ ss, whereas U2 snRNP is directed to the appropriate 3′ ss by short, conserved pre-mRNA sequences, including a branch point sequence (BPS), the polypyrimidine (Py) tract, and the AG dinucleotide at the intron-exon junction. Prior to U2 snRNP recruitment, SF1 recognizes the BPS, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) large subunit (U2AF2) recognizes the Py tract, and U2AF small subunit (U2AF1) recognizes the AG dinucleotide. Subsequently, the U2 snRNP replaces SF1 in an ATP-dependent process that facilitates protein and RNA rearrangements. In particular, the N terminus of SF3B1, a U2 snRNP component, has been shown to bind with U2AF2, whereas the SF3B1 C terminus along with another U2 snRNP component, p14, interacts with the BPS and nearby pre-mRNA sequences (Gozani et al., 1998). In addition, U2 snRNP and pre-mRNA complex is stabilized by a base-paired duplex between the U2 snRNA and the BPS. The subsequent binding of U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP induces structural rearrangements that lead to activation of two catalytic steps that generate the lariat intermediate and subsequent final exon-exon product (Horowitz, 2012; Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009).  The recurrent hotspot mutations in SF3B1 are found exclusively in the C-terminal HEAT domains (residues 622–781; Figure S1A). Though there has been lack of structural information on how SF3B1 interacts with pre-mRNA, previous cryo-electron microscopy studies suggest that SF3B1 may undergo a conformational change to a more open form that enables mRNA binding and BPS recognition by the U2 snRNP (Golas et al., 2003). Although it was previously reported by several groups that SF3B1 mutant-positive cancers are associated with aberrant splicing (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013), here, we show that SF3B1 hotspot mutations (SF3B1MUT) result in neomorphic activity causing aberrant splicing. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ ss selection through the use of a branch point (BP) different from the BP utilized by SF3B1 wild-type (SF3B1WT) and that SF3B1MUT still requires the canonical Py tract for the formation of the active spliceosome to induce aberrant splicing. We predict that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced mRNAs are subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that multiple aberrant transcripts are degraded, resulting in downregulation of the associated canonical protein in cell line models and patient samples. These insights into the splicing aberrations induced by SF3B1MUT will enable discovery of downstream consequences that contribute to neoplasms and the discovery of targeted therapeutic approaches for SF3B1MUT cancers.  Results SF3B1MUT Tumor-Specific Splicing Defects  To provide a more complete understanding of the splicing aberrations observed in SF3B1MUT cancers, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from different tumor types were analyzed using a bioinformatic pipeline that we developed in order to quantify exon-exon junctions without the need of predetermined alternative splicing models or annotated splice junctions. The analysis pipeline was applied to CLL patient samples (7 SF3B1MUT and 6 SF3B1WT) and a number of samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas: luminal A primary BRCA (7 SF3B1K700E and 14 SF3B1WT), SKCM (3 SF3B1MUT and 12 SF3B1WT), and UVM (18 SF3B1MUT and 18 SF3B1WT) (Table S1). This analysis revealed 895 aberrant splice junctions to be significantly upregulated in SF3B1MUT compared to SF3B1WT of which 534 events (∼60%) were unique as they had not been previously annotated in major transcriptome databases. The majority of aberrant splicing events observed were aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures 1A and S1B; Table S2), consistent with previous observations (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013).

(C) Gene expression for each significantly abnormally and common spliced gene across the four different diseases, quantified in unit of TPM (transcripts per million); ∗ indicates the statistically significant diseases. Box plots and whiskers are represented as per the Tukey method. See also Figure S1 and Tables S2 and S3. Figure options Unsupervised clustering was applied to the identified aberrant junctions and it led to clustering of SF3B1MUT samples distinct from the cluster of SF3B1WT samples (Figure 1B), with the exception of two SF3B1MUT samples (TCGA-D8-A1JH and TCGA-ER-A19S) that clustered with the SF3B1WT samples. This was likely driven by low mutant allele fractions (7% and 14%, respectively) when compared with a range of 25%–52% for other samples (Figure 1B; Table S2). Moreover, samples with SF3B1MUT clustered within each tumor type (BRCA, SKCM, UVM, and CLL), each showing a set of unique aberrantly spliced junctions (Figures 1B and S1C). A set of “common” events (i.e., events found in all tumor types) were observed, consistent with a small overlap of splicing abnormalities found in CLL and UVM described in two previous reports (Furney et al., 2013). The pattern of tumor-specific splicing in BRCA and CLL could, at least in part, be explained by the increased expression of the genes that are aberrantly spliced in these tumor types compared to the other diseases (p = 7.5022 × 10−05 and p = 1.0078 × 10−36, respectively); however, the same was not observed for SKCM and UVM (Figure 1C; Table S3). This suggests that additional mechanisms, such as tissue-specific splicing regulation, might contribute to these patterns.  Using the aberrant junctions identified in the previous analysis, we extended the clustering analysis to include 14 MDS RARS samples (12 SF3B1MUT) and an additional 19 samples from TCGA with miscellaneous SF3B1 mutations (Table S1). For the MDS samples, relatively low sequencing depth and inclusion of just two SF3B1WT samples precluded their use for the discovery of MDS-specific aberrant junctions. While all SF3B1MUT MDS patients and three BRCA patients (p.N626D, p.D781E, and p.K666E) clustered with the original SF3B1MUT sample set, 16 SF3B1 mutant patients clustered with SF3B1WT samples (Figure S1D). These patient samples carried mutations in SF3B1 (“Non-hotspot” in Figure S1D and Table S1) that are not co-localized with the hotspot mutations in the HEAT domain. These analyses strongly suggest a convergence of mechanism and downstream splicing effects induced by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1 Mutations Induce Aberrant mRNA Splicing in Human and Mouse Cells  To study SF3B1MUT in vitro, a pancreatic cancer cell line carrying endogenous SF3B1 mutations (Panc05.04: p.Q699H and p.K700E) was utilized. In addition, the p.K700E, p.K666N, or p.H662Q mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E, Nalm-6 SF3B1K666N, Nalm-6 SF3B1H662Q) or a synonymous mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700K, referred as SF3B1WT) was introduced by AAV-mediated homology to the Nalm-6 pre-B cell line to produce isogenic matched cell lines. Unsupervised clustering of these cell lines and a panel of several SF3B1WT pancreatic cancer cell lines using the aberrant splice junctions identified in patient samples resulted in clear segregation of SF3B1MUT cell lines from SF3B1WT cells (Figure 2A). A similar increase in aberrant splice junctions observed in RNA-seq data analysis was confirmed in Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells using a Nanostring assay developed to quantify aberrant splice junctions (Figure S2A). Panc05.04 cells carry the hotspot mutation p.K700E and a mutation at position 699 (p.Q699H) that is not observed in patient samples. When the p.Q699H and p.K700E were expressed alone or in combination in 293FT cells, only cells expressing p.K700E and p.Q699H/p.K700E induced aberrant splicing indicating that p.Q699H does not appear to affect this aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures S2B and S2C). These data confirm that Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1MUT cell lines are representative models to study the splicing functional activity of SF3B1MUT in vitro.

Data are represented as mean of three biological replicates. Data are presented in box plots as boxes in the first and third quartiles, midline as the median, and whiskers extending to the range excluding outliers. See also Figure S2. Figure options To confirm that additional cancer-associated SF3B1 hotspot mutations induced aberrant splicing, we expressed various mxSF3B1MUT, mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R in 293FT cells (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for a description of mxSF3B1; Figure S2D) and analyzed splicing aberrations by Nanostring. The p.K700R mutation served as a negative control as it doesn’t introduce a major change in charge or size of the amino acid and is not disease associated. All SF3B1MUT tested demonstrated the same usage of aberrant splice sites observed in endogenous and engineered cell lines; however, the SF3B1K700R or SF3B1WT did not show these splicing changes (Figure 2B). Moreover, the expression of any of the SF3B1 constructs did not change the overall expression (sum of aberrant and canonical) of affected genes (Figure 2B). To further confirm the correlation between expression of SF3B1 p.K700E mutation and aberrant splicing, tetracycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to selectively knockdown (KD) the SF3B1MUT or SF3B1WT allele in Panc05.04 and Panc10.05 (SF3B1MUT and SF3B1WT cells). After confirmation of KD efficiency (Figures S2E–S2H), RNA isolated from treated cells was analyzed by Nanostring. Depletion of the SF3B1MUT allele in Panc05.04 resulted in downregulation of aberrant splice isoforms, whereas an accumulation of aberrant splice isoforms was observed with selective SF3B1WT allele depletion (Figures 2C and 2D), indicating that SF3B1MUT was responsible for the appearance of aberrant splicing. These results were also supported by the expression of a pan shRNA or depletion of SF3B1WT in the Panc10.05 where no effect on aberrant splicing was observed (Figures 2C and 2D). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT acquires a neomorphic function and may also lose wild-type splicing activity. This observation was also supported by the recent paper by Zhou et al. proposing that in a different SF3B1 mutant cell line (ESS1) wild-type SF3B1 was required for survival (Zhou et al., 2015).  SF3B1MUT Recognizes a Cryptic 3′ AG with a Short and Weak Py Tract  The most common splicing abnormality observed in SF3B1MUT cells was the usage of an aberrant 3′ ss. To understand the sequence features and the mechanism by which mutant SF3B1 would induce aberrant splicing, computational analysis of SF3B1MUT patient data and minigene assay validation methods were utilized. First, an enrichment of the cryptic AGs was determined to be located between −15 and −24 nt upstream of the canonical 3′ ss in SF3B1MUT patient samples (Figure 3A). In contrast, the first AG (but not GAG) upstream of a canonical AG in RefSeq showed a much lower density in this region and a wider distribution. Interestingly, the motif sequences associated with the cryptic and canonical AGs showed several different features. Upstream of the canonical AGs, a clear enrichment of pyrimidines was observed in agreement with the presence of a Py tract, whereas the cryptic AGs were associated with a short and weak Py tract and an enrichment of adenines (A) that are possibly important for BPS selection. In contrast, no clear features were associated with the first upstream AGs in RefSeq (Figures 3B and S3). Interestingly, similar features, such as the position of cryptic AG between −15 and −24, the presence of a short and weak Py tract, and an enrichment of As were observed in aberrant 3′ spliced junctions detected in NIH 3T3 mouse cells overexpressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures S4A–S4C). While similar features associated with aberrant splice junction usage were observed in mxSF3B1K700E mouse cells, the overlap of affected junctions observed in human cells was low due to low sequence similarity of introns between species (Figure S4D; Table S4). An exception was observed for the UXS1 gene for which the junction between exon 2 and exon 3 is conserved among different species ( Figure S4E). These data strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant splicing in the presence of competing 3′ ss via a sequence-dependent feature located within the intron and preferentially recognizes cryptic splice sites with weaker Py tract in close proximity to an enrichment of As.

Shown here is a representative ethidium-bromide-stained 2.5% agarose gel of the indicated RT-PCR reactions of mRNA isolated from transfected cells. See also Figures S4 and S5 and Table S4. Figure options To confirm the importance of these specific sequence features, we selected the exon 9/exon 10 junction in ZDHHC16 to develop a minigene as it was observed to be aberrantly spliced among all the SF3B1 hotspot mutant samples analyzed. In addition, several alterations in the cryptic 3′ ss, the length/strength of the Py tracts, and the potential BPS were tested ( Figure S5A). Splicing was assessed by RT-PCR using cDNA prepared from 293FT cells co-transfected with ZDHHC16 minigene and mxSF3B1 plasmid. As expected, when the ZDHHC16 exon 9, intron 9 and exon 10 (E9-I9-E10) minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, only canonical splicing was observed, whereas in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E and all the other hotspot mutations, both canonical and aberrant splicing was detected (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 4 and 5; Figure S5B). Interestingly, once the cryptic AG was removed (E9-I9NoAG-E10), aberrant splicing was not observed even in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that the cryptic AG is necessary for aberrant splicing. To understand whether exonic sequences play a role in aberrant splicing, we looked at the preceding junction in ZDHHC16 (E8-I8-E9). As expected, no aberrant splicing was observed when this minigene was co-transfected with any of the mxSF3B1 constructs (Figure 3D, lanes 10 and 11). Canonical and aberrant splicing was detected when intron 8 between exon 8 and 9 was replaced with intron 9 (E8-I9-E9) in the ZDHHC16 minigene and co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, but not when co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R (Figure 3D, lanes 12 and 13). These results agree with the computational analysis suggesting that the cryptic AG is necessary and the intronic features are sufficient to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  Identification of the 3′ ss occurs during early assembly of the spliceosome, in particular when the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex recognizes the Py tract and AG, and then again when the AG is recognized during the second step of splicing (Horowitz, 2012). To understand if the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is sufficient to recruit the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex, the length/strength of the canonical Py tract was reduced from 19 nt to 10, 6, and 2 nt (PyT 10n, PyT 6n, and PyT 2n, respectively) or the weak and short cryptic Py tract was replaced with a strong Py tract (SELEX) (Figure S5A) (Lim et al., 2011). When the minigene PyT 2n (or PyT 10n and PyT 6n, in Figure S5C) was co-transfected with the mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, the splicing event occurred with selection of a new cryptic 3′ ss within exon 10 positioned 54 nt downstream of the canonical 3′ ss (sequencing data not shown), suggesting that the PyT 2n was not recognized by U2AF complex (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15; Figure S5C). This is in agreement with previous reports suggesting that Py tract length and strength are necessary for the recruitment of U2AF2/U2AF1 to guide splicing to occur at that position (Coolidge et al., 1997). Surprisingly, when the same minigenes were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, similar results were observed and splicing occurred within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15), suggesting that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is not sufficient to recruit the U2AF complex and that the cryptic AG requires the downstream canonical Py tract to induce aberrant splicing. The nucleotide base upstream of the AG dinucleotide has been reported to be critical for U2AF1 interaction in early recognition of 3′ ss and is usually a T/C in consensus sequences (Ilagan et al., 2015). Hence, introduction of a G upstream of the canonical or cryptic AG (−3 T > G or −24 C > G) would potentially abolish their use as a 3′ ss, respectively. When −3 T > G minigene was co-transfected with either mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E constructs, splicing was observed within exon 10, similar to PyT 2n, suggesting again that the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex needs to be recruited at the canonical AG during first step of splicing to allow usage of the cryptic AG by SF3B1MUT (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 16 and 17). Interestingly, when −24 C > G minigene was used, only canonical splicing was observed, even after mxSF3B1K700E expression (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 8 and 9). These data suggest that the −3 position relative to cryptic AG is also important when the cryptic 3′ ss is recognized during the second transesterification reaction of splicing. Moreover, when the short and weak cryptic Py tract was replaced with a SELEX Py tract, the cryptic AG was used as the preferred 3′ ss by cells expressing both mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 18 and 19). Taken together, these data support the notion that the sequence features required by SF3B1MUT-containing U2 snRNP complex are located within the intron and that the cryptic AG and the downstream canonical Py tract are required to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1MUT Utilizes a Different BPS  The computational analysis of motifs near the 3′ ss showed an enrichment of As upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse mutant SF3B1 cells, suggesting the importance of this sequence for the SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 complex. DeBoever and colleagues suggested that these were the BPSs for the mutant and wild-type SF3B1 complexes using a BPS prediction algorithm (DeBoever et al., 2015). Instead, we used the recently mapped BPS data using K562 SF3B1WT cells and overlaid these data with introns in which the aberrant splice junctions were observed in SF3B1MUT cells (Mercer et al., 2015). A total of 151 BPs were mapped among 93 introns; 60 introns have only one identified BP, and another 33 introns contain multiple reported BPs. The distribution of these BPs with respect to the cryptic AG indicated that the majority of BPs overlapped with the A of the cryptic AG or were in close proximity (between 1, cryptic A and −5), but did not coincide with the enrichment of As observed in the motif analysis (Figure 4A). The enrichment of As was observed between −8 and −18 nt upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse cells expressing mutant SF3B1 (Figures 4B and S4C). This suggests that these As could play an important role for SF3B1MUT function. To test this hypothesis, the 3 As located between −33 and −35 were mutated to Gs in the ZDHHC16 minigene (−33 to −35 AAA > GGG; Figure 4C and S5A). When this minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT and mxSF3B1K700R, canonical splicing was observed, suggesting that these As are not part of the BPS for wild-type U2 complex (Figure 4D, lanes 11 and 12). Instead, when the cells were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, canonical splicing was observed without any aberrant splicing, indicating that the three As are probably part of the BPS used by the U2 mutant complex (Figure 4D, lane 12). To identify the BPS used by the U2 wild-type complex, the A at position −26 and −30 alone or together were mutated to G (−26 A > G, −30 A > G and −26, −30 AA > GG; Figure 4C). When the A at position −26 alone or both −26 and −30 were mutated to G and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, splicing was observed within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10), suggesting that this is likely the BPS for SF3B1WT, but not for SF3B1K700E, as canonical and aberrant splicing was observed in these conditions (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10). Interestingly, when the minigene with the A at position −30 alone was mutated to G (Figure 4C and S5A) and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R splicing was observed mostly within exon 10 and when co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, only aberrant splicing was observed (Figure 4D, lanes 7 and 8). As expected, when all the As were mutated to Gs (all A > G, Figures 4C and S5A), each mxSF3B1 construct spliced within exon 10 (Figure 4D, lanes 13 and 14). Additionally, this outcome was confirmed by mapping the two different BPs using nested PCR analysis and sequencing of endogenous ZDHHC16 intron 9 lariat in K562 isogenic cells ( Figure 4E). Unlike in SF3B1WT cells, we observed at least two major templates with different sequences in the SF3B1K700E cells due to a mixed population of SF3B1WT and SF3B1MUT proteins. Through analysis and matching of expected transcript sequences using Mutation Surveyor, we found that −34 A and −30 A were the BPs used for SF3B1K700E and SF3B1WT, respectively. To extend our observation, we also mapped BPs in four additional genes that are aberrantly spliced in presence of SF3B1K700E: TMEM14C (intron 1), SEPT6 (intron 9), DLST (intron 5), and DIP2A (intron 23) ( Table S5). These results prove that the SF3B1 wild-type and mutant-containing U2 complexes are able to use two different BPs.  SF3B1MUT Uses a Different BPS than SF3B1WT(A) Relative positions of mapped BP ...

Figure options Aberrant Transcripts Generated by SF3B1MUT Are Subjected to NMD  Erroneous or aberrant mRNAs that contain a premature termination codon are subjected to NMD to prevent potential deleterious effects of their translation to proteins (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Computational analysis revealed that the majority of cryptic AGs were located upstream of canonical 3′ ss at nucleotide distances that were not multiples of 3 (Figure 5A). This result suggested that the aberrant transcripts would have a higher probability to be out of frame and therefore degraded by NMD. To confirm that predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts were degraded by the NMD pathway, RNA-seq was performed on Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells treated with cycloheximide, a translation inhibitor known to inhibit NMD (Singh et al., 2012). Bioinformatic prediction analysis revealed that 44% of all aberrant mRNAs identified in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cell lines would result in an NMD-sensitive transcript (Rivas et al., 2015) (Figure 5B; Tables S6 and S7). RNA-seq analysis from Nalm-6 isogenic cells demonstrated that NMD-sensitive genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E than Nalm-6 SF3B1WT (p = 1.06 × 10−12), whereas predicted NMD-insensitive genes were expressed at similar levels (Figure 5C). RNA-seq analysis identified 41 predicted NMD-sensitive genes to be both downregulated in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E and to have increased abundance following cycloheximide treatment (Figure 5D; Table S6), suggesting that these aberrant transcripts were degraded by the NMD. In addition, to evaluate if this would result in downregulation of the associated canonical protein, stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) with subsequent mass spectrometry was used to quantify protein levels in Nalm-6 isogenic lines (Oda et al., 1999)· Eleven predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts for which peptides could be detected in Nalm-6 SF3B1WT were selected for evaluation, and ten were found to have decreased peptide counts by at least 2- to 8-fold (e.g., ABCB7, AKAP8L; Figure 6A). Decreased expression of canonical proteins was confirmed by western blot analysis using available antibodies, such as MZB1, PHGDH, and SEPT6 (Figure 6B). Among the downregulated proteins in the SILAC experiment were two proteins of particular interest: MZB1 and ABCB7. MZB1 is a B cell-specific and ER-localized protein implicated in antibody secretion and integrin-mediated cell adhesion (van Anken et al., 2009). As shown in Figure 6C, MZB1 was aberrantly spliced in SF3B1K700E cells and the canonical isoform was clearly downregulated at transcript and protein level (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6D). As shown in Figure 6E, clear downregulation of canonical MZB1 protein level was also observed in four out of five CLL patients with SF3B1MUT, but not in SF3B1WT samples. The result for patient 8 could be explained by the low allele fraction for Y623C (10%), and this was associated with undetectable aberrant splicing for ZDHHC16 and no change in canonical MZB1 when compared with one of the SF3B1WT patients (Figure S6). ABCB7 is a mediator of iron accumulation and erythroid growth and has been reported to be downregulated specifically in an MDS subtype characterized by refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (Boultwood et al., 2008). Interestingly, SF3B1 mutations have been found at a frequency of 80%–90% in RARS, but not in other MDS subtypes (Papaemmanuil et al., 2011). In addition, a partial loss-of-function mutation in ABCB7 has been identified in X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia demonstrating an iron-overload phenotype in cells with defective ABCB7 (Allikmets et al., 1999). We identified that ABCB7 is aberrantly spliced in SF3B1 mutant cells (Figure 6F) and demonstrated that the aberrant transcript is subject to NMD, causing downregulation of the canonical transcript and protein (Figures 6A and 6D). Therefore, aberrant splicing and subsequent NMD of ABCB7 likely explains the association between ABCB7 downregulation observed in RARS and the presence of SF3B1 mutants. Taken together, these data suggest that SF3B1MUT might contribute to the phenotypes observed in diseases by inducing the generation of NMD-sensitive transcripts through aberrant splicing and to a subsequent reduction in the levels of the corresponding proteins.  44% of All Aberrantly Spliced Genes Are Putative Targets of NMD(A) Frequency of ...

See also Figure S6. Figure options Discussion In the current study, we describe the mechanism by which SF3B1 hotspot mutations induce aberrant splicing and the fate of resulting NMD-sensitive aberrant mRNAs in several cancer types. These mutations are associated with the expression of hundreds of aberrantly spliced junctions, mostly by utilizing a cryptic AG. While some aberrant junctions are common across different cancer types, others are tumor specific, which in some cases is a consequence of tissue-specific gene expression; however, additional factors likely contribute to these differences. Interestingly, aberrant splicing was observed only in patients carrying hotspot mutations located in the C-terminal HEAT domains, but not in samples from “non-hotspot” patients, as they clustered with the SF3B1WT patients in aberrant junction usage comparisons. The majority of these non-hotspot mutations are located away from the HEAT repeat domains, which suggests that they may have different effects on cancer cells or simply are passenger mutations, and are not the focus of the present study. We calculated an electrostatic potential map based on a homology model of SF3B1WT with importin-β and observed that all hotspot mutations are co-localized in a limited, positively charged region even though they are distributed across five different HEAT domains (Figure 7A). Furthermore, while there are various amino acid substitutions at the hotspots that result in change of size and/or polarity of side chains, our data suggest the functional consequences on splicing for these changes are similar. We show that hotspot SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ splicing in junctions associated with specific sequence features: an enrichment of As followed by a short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG located −15 to −24 nt from the canonical 3′ ss.

The color scheme of the electric potential surface is +10 V (blue) and −10 V (red). The position of the hotspot mutations located in the five HEAT repeat domains (highlighted in yellow) is represented in the inset. (B and C) Schematic representation of splicing in SF3B1WT (B) and SF3B1MUT (C) cells and molecular consequences of transcripts is also shown. Figure options Based on computational analysis, it was recently suggested that SF3B1 mutations cause a change in the size of the sterically protected region downstream of the BP without any altered BP recognition allowing the utilization of the cryptic AG (DeBoever et al., 2015). It was also suggested that SF3B1 mutations could alter interactions with U2AF2, affecting the ability to recognize the canonical 3′ ss and leading to cryptic 3′ ss selection. In contrast, we provide experimental evidence that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is insufficient for the recruitment of the U2AF complex and that the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss, and thereby interaction with U2AF2 is required to observe aberrant splicing as well. In addition, we have demonstrated that the SF3B1MUT U2 complex utilizes a BP that is different from the one used by the wild-type U2 complex (proposed model, Figures 7B and 7C). Based on these data and the restricted localization of the hotspot mutations, we hypothesize that SF3B1MUT interacts differently with the pre-mRNA or splicing factors that are important for the recognition of AG during the second step of splicing. The close proximity of the two mapped BPs for ZDHHC16 (−30A for SF3B1WT and −34A for SF3B1MUT) reported here (Figure 4E) and the published data on the crosslinking of SF3B1 to bases flanking the BPS (Gozani et al., 1998) would suggest a competition between the SF3B1WT- and SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 snRNP complexes to select the canonical or cryptic AG for splicing, respectively. The mechanism by which SF3B1MUT favors selection of a different BP can only be speculated at this point. Based on our data and a previous study investigating spliceostatin A’s mechanism of action (Corrionero et al., 2011), there are at least two hypotheses: the selection of the new BP is guided by SF3B1MUT through enhanced direct interactions with specific nucleotides flanking the new BPS compensating for reduced base pairing with U2 snRNA or by the base pairing of U2 snRNA with the new/suboptimal BPS compensating for impaired interactions of SF3B1MUT across the canonical BPS.  Although SF3B1MUT does not seem to affect the pre-assembly of U2 snRNP (preliminary data not shown), it is possible that the interactions with splicing factors involved in selection of an alternative AG in the second step of splicing are impaired. Previously, it has been reported that the second step splicing factor, Slu7, is required for correct 3′ ss selection (Chua and Reed, 1999a ;  Chua and Reed, 1999b). Similar to U2AF1, Slu7 harbors a Zn knuckle domain, and it is conceivable that it directly interacts with AG during the second step of splicing. As observed in the case of SF3B1MUT, depletion of Slu7 results in selection of a cryptic AG closer to the BPS. This suggests that SF3B1 hotspot mutations may impair the recruitment of Slu7 to the catalytic core. Additionally, it has been reported that splicing factor SPF45 (hSPF45 is RBM17) is involved in recognition and activation of an alternative AG upstream of the canonical 3′ ss. It has been suggested that SPF45 directly or indirectly binds to the upstream alternative AG with the help of SF3B1 and promotes its utilization during the second catalytic step (Corsini et al., 2007 ;  Lallena et al., 2002). Interestingly, as observed in the present study for SF3B1MUT, SPF45 also depends on the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss to splice at the alternative AG. Since SF3B1MUT binds at a different BPS, it can be speculated that the recruited SPF45 can access the cryptic AG which is otherwise prevented due to the steric hindrance by SF3B1WT. Taken together, the SF3B1 hotspot mutations could be facilitating SPF45 activity and/or abrogating Slu7 activity for selection of the aberrant AG, thereby providing an unanticipated mechanism for regulation of splice site utilization.  Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is a known cellular mechanism that adds complexity and flexibility in gene expression to induce stage-specific patterns not only by inducing expression of a particular isoform but also by engaging NMD to downregulate gene expression (Ge and Porse, 2014 ;  Kalyna et al., 2012). Here, we predicted that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced transcripts in SF3B1MUT cells are NMD sensitive, and we have demonstrated that the associated canonical isoforms are downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels. The downregulation of a large number of genes induced by this “spliceosome sickness” could be the cause of impaired cell functions that contribute to cancer phenotypes and potentially create dependency on essential genes or pathways for survival. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency is a proposed mechanism for disease pathogenesis in MDS, where chromosome 5q is deleted and decreased expression of genes located on the remaining chromosome is observed (e.g., RPS14 and CSKN1A1; Ebert et al., 2008 ;  Schneider et al., 2014). It is plausible that SF3B1 mutations contribute to MDS in a similar fashion by downregulating expression of certain genes resulting in a non-classical path to haploinsufficiency. In addition to the downregulation of canonical proteins, it is also possible that NMD-insensitive aberrant transcripts are translated into aberrant proteins that have altered function. Proteomic analysis of isogenic SF3B1MUT cells did not reveal the presence of aberrant proteins (data not shown), but this may be due to limitations of assay sensitivity, and additional targeted SILAC or deep RNA sequencing of active ribosome fractions may have the required sensitivity to detect such proteins. Recently, several groups reported the molecular consequences and phenotypic effects of other spliceosome mutations, such as U2AF1 and the exonic splicing enhancer binding serine/arginine-rich protein SRSF2 ( Ilagan et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015 ;  Shirai et al., 2015). Though there are some overlaps in genes differentially spliced in tissues affected by each spliceosome mutation, we see only minimal overlaps in predicted NMD targets (Figure S7). However, mutations in all three splicing factors are observed in MDS and are mutually exclusive, suggesting that some of the downstream effects might be common. Thus, while not explored in this study, it is likely that SF3B1 mutations result in defects in hematopoiesis, as has been observed in animal models of SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations. Additional work is ongoing to define the downstream splicing abnormalities that drive the phenotypic effects of spliceosome mutations. Finally, it is also plausible that mutations in SF3B1 impact other proposed splicing regulators (e.g., chromatin, histone modifications), and these should be the subject of future study ( de Almeida et al., 2011; Kfir et al., 2015 ;  Khan et al., 2013).  In summary, computational and experimental approaches were used to demonstrate that SF3B1MUT utilizes a different BP to induce aberrant splicing across multiple cancer types. These insights describe a neomorphic activity for SF3B1 mutations that causes downregulation of canonical protein expression. Furthermore, these studies provide a foundation for the potential discovery of targeted approaches for the treatment of patients carrying SF3B1 hotspot mutations.  Perturbation in iron homeostasis is a hallmark of some hematologic diseases. Abnormal sideroblasts with accumulation of iron in the mitochondria are named ring sideroblasts (RS). RS is a cardinal feature of refractory anemia with RS (RARS) and RARS with marked thrombocytosis (RARS/-T). Mutations in SF3B1, a member of the RNA splicing machinery are frequent in RARS/-T and defects of this gene were linked to RS formation. Here we showcase the differences in iron architecture of SF3B1-mutant and wild-type (WT) RARS/-T and provide new mechanistic insights by which SF3B1 mutations lead to differences in iron. We found higher iron levels in SF3B1 mutant vs WT RARS/-T by transmission electron microscopy/spectroscopy/flow cytometry. SF3B1 mutations led to increased iron without changing the valence as shown by the presence of Fe2+ in mutant and WT. Reactive oxygen species and DNA damage were not increased in SF3B1-mutant patients. RNA-sequencing and Reverse transcriptase PCR showed higher expression of a specific isoform of SLC25A37 in SF3B1-mutant patients, a crucial importer of Fe2+ into the mitochondria. Our studies suggest that SF3B1 mutations contribute to cellular iron overload in RARS/-T by deregulating SLC25A37.  Top of page Introduction Free iron in the erythroblasts of patients with refractory anemia was the first observation that led to the description of sideroblastic anemia (SA).1 Ringed sideroblasts (RS) is a feature observed in both congenital and acquired SA cases. RS are erythroid precursors in the bone marrow (BM) with abnormal iron deposition in the mitochondria that appears as a crystalline ring of granules around the nucleus. Presence of 15% or more RS, accompanied by anemia, erythrodysplasia, <5% BM and <1% peripheral blood (PB) blasts, define refractory anemia with RS (RARS). Patients fulfilling criteria for RARS with elevated platelet counts are diagnosed as RARS-T. BM iron stores and diffuse pattern of iron deposits are often detected and have been correlated with the presence of RS.2 During the years, abnormalities in mitochondrial iron have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both congenital and acquired SA.3, 4, 5 Genetic studies found that heritable mutations in an erythroid-specific mitochondrial gene, delta aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2) cause X-linked SA. Mutations in ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 7 (ABCB7)—a mitochondrial inner iron transporter—were also found in X-linked SA and spinocerebellar ataxia and in cases of congenital SA with isodicentric (X)(q13).6 Homozygous mutations in glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5), in solute carrier family 25, member 38 (SLC25A38) and in pseudouridine synthase-1 (PUS-1) have been described in congenital SA. Reduced messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels due to germline polymorphism in ferrochelatase (FECH) were found in other cases of SA.5, 7, 8 No somatic or germline mutations in the above genes have been found in RARS and RARS with marked thrombocytosis (RARS/-T) even though crucial genes of the mitochondrial trafficking have been found to be differentially regulated including overexpression of ALAS2 and FTMT (ferritin-encoding gene) and downregulation of ABCB7 in CD34+ cells derived from RARS compared with healthy subjects. The discovery of recurrent somatic mutations in splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1), a component of the RNA-splicing machinery in RARS/-T represents a key breakthrough in the understanding of the pathogenesis of RARS/-T.9, 10, 11 More importantly, our finding that SF3B1 mutations confer a different mitochondrial iron pattern in RARS/-T12 suggests that SF3B1 may be involved in the regulation of downstream proteins of the mitochondrial network.  In the present study, we examined the cellular iron phenotypes in SF3B1-mutant and wild-type (WT) RARS/-T patients by performing a series of novel electron microscopy techniques combined with spectroscopy, flow cytometry and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiments. Our study suggests that SF3B1-mutant RARS/-T patients have distinct iron distribution compared with their WT counterparts and that this is mediated through perturbations in splicing patterns in key mitochondrial iron proteins, specifically SLC25A37.  Top of page Materials and methods Patients and healthy subjects BM and PB cells were obtained from patients with MDS and healthy controls with written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Cleveland Clinic. Diagnosis was assigned according to 2008 World Health Organization classification criteria. Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy Fresh BM mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were isolated using lymphocyte separation media (Corning cellgro, Manassas, VA, USA). One million BMMNCs were first subjected to fixation, washing and dehydration in an ascending-graded alcohol mixture before being embedded in pure epoxy resin as previously described.12 Specimens were initially evaluated by light microscopy of 1 μm plastic sections stained with a combination of toluidine blue and basic fuchsin dyes. Thin sections from selected tissue blocks were cut at 60–80 nm and supported on a 200 mesh copper grids. Sections were stained using osmium impregnation (OTOTO technique) in order to increase the stability under the electron beam, and examined using a Zeiss Libra 200 transmission electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Electron micrographs were taken using a Gatan Orius CCD digital camera (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA). Sections were then analyzed to resolve the elemental composition, chemical status and oxidation state of iron by scanning TEM (STEM) coupled with X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). STEM images were acquired with a high-angle annular dark-field detector. XEDS is a powerful technique that can rapidly determine the elemental composition of a sample. XEDS is the analytical technique most commonly used for the elemental analysis or chemical characterization of a specimen. The principle of XEDS is based on the fact that when a high-energy electron beam is focused on a specimen of interest, the incident beam can excite an electron in an inner shell producing the ejection of the latter from the shell and the formation of an electron hole. An electron from an outer shell drops down to fill the hole, and the difference in energy between the higher-energy shell and the lower-energy shell is released in the form of an X-ray, which can be measured by XEDS. Some of these emitted X-ray photons will enter the X-ray detector and create a charge pulse that is proportional to the energy of the emitted X-ray photon. The charge pulse is in turn converted to a voltage pulse, which is further amplified by a field-effect transistor. The amplified voltage pulse is then stored into a multichannel analyzer. As the energy of the X-rays is characteristic of the atomic structure of the element from which they were emitted, the elemental composition of the specimen can be determined using the relative intensity. The Zeiss Libra 200 has a Noran XEDS system attached to it. This system contains a Li drifted Si detector capable of an energy resolution of 140 eV full-width half-maximum from a Mn Kα line. EELS technique involves the measurement of the energy distribution of electrons that have interacted with a specimen and lost energy due to inelastic scattering. The distribution of transmitted electrons as a function of energy loss is called an energy-loss spectrum. Such spectrum carries invaluable information about the chemical composition of a sample as well as information about bonding, coordination and charge transfer on an atomic level due to its high-energy resolution (~0.5 ev). This ability to achieve such a high-energy resolution, when compared with XEDS, provides the ability to not only identify the elements present but also to determine their chemical state. This technique is complementary to EDS analysis, as it provides the qualitative analysis of light elements. A detailed description of both techniques can be found elsewhere.13, 14  Flow cytometry Fresh PB or BMMNCs (3–5 × 105 cells) were treated with calcein-AM (0.05 μm) (Cat. #17783; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and commercially available rhodamine B (1 μm) (Cat. #79754; Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and reconstituted in PBS before flow cytometry acquisition. RhoNox-1 was prepared in-house by chemical modification of commercial rhodamine B as previously described in order to selectively detect Fe2+.15 For the experiment conducted with RhoNox-1, 3 × 105 BMMNCs were incubated in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s serum-free medium with FeO4S (100 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After incubation, cells were washed and incubated with RhoNox-1 (2 μm) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed before acquisition. FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA) was used for the analysis of the RhoNox-1 experiment. Double strands DNA breaks were measured by staining PB or BMMNCs with an antibody to H2AX phosphorylated on serine residue 139 (γ-H2AX). Cells (2–5 × 105) were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 90% cold methanol and stained with Alexa 488-conjugated γ-H2AX antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) in 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Percentage of γ-H2AX-positive cells was analyzed with a CXP software on a FC500 flow cytometer. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using CellROX Green Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). PB or BMMNCs (2–5 × 105 cells) were washed and maintained in PBS. Cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 1.5%), an inducer of oxidative stress for 10 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Untreated cells were used as control. After the incubation, cells were washed in PBS once and were stained with CellROX Green reagent (0.025 mm) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS and then analyzed. All the acquisitions were done on an FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA). A total of 30 000 events were collected.  Sanger sequencing Direct sequencing was performed on SF3B1 (exon13–16; uc002uue.1)9, 16 and SLC25A37 (exons 1–4; uc003xdo.3) coding regions using an available set of primers (genome.ucsc.edu). Sequencing analyses were performed using DNA from BM or PB mononuclear cells. Bidirectional sequencing was performed by standard techniques using an ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Mutational analysis was assessed on the basis that alterations are somatic if they were not detected in healthy individuals, in CD3-positive cells (germline source) derived from patients cells, in published SNP databases (dbSNP, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP) and/or they were not reported as SNPs in previous publications. RNA-Sequencing analysis/Transcript Variant detection Total RNA was isolated from BMMNCs of 6 RARS/-T patients (SF3B1 mutant, n=3; WT, n=3) and three healthy subjects. RNA (1.5–3 μg) was subjected to RNA-seq using Illumina HiSeq2000 (Otogenetics, Norcross, GA, USA). Approximately 20 million sequencing reads were generated per subject. Hundred base pair paired-end RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the hg19 RefSeq human transcriptome and spliceome by DNAnexus (http://dnanexus.com) using a Bayesian method17 where a read was mapped when its posterior probability of mapping exceeded 0.9. These filtered posterior probabilities were summed to generate fractional read counts per gene and exon, with probabilities from splice junction spanning reads counted for each relevant exon. We used rounded gene and exon read counts as inputs for our differential expression analyses. For differential gene expression analysis, we used TMM18 normalization and the voom-limma approach19 from the R package limma version 3.18 with R version 3.0.2 in order to perform differential gene expression analysis for comparisons of interest.  For the differential exon usage analysis, we used the R package DEXSeq, version 1.4.0 with R version 2.15.2 to perform differential exon usage analysis for comparison of interest. For the gene set and exon set over/under representation analysis, we used the R package goseq version 1.6.0 (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/goseq.html)20 to perform over and under representation analysis of gene sets taking length bias into account.12  For differential transcript analysis, we first realigned the raw RNA-Seq reads to the human transcriptome from Ensembl Release 73 using the STAR aligner21 version 2.3.1. Transcriptome-aligned reads were then passed to BitSeq version 0.7022 to generate 100 draws of fractional transcript counts per subject. For each set of draws of the transcript counts, we used TMM18 normalization with the voom-limma approach19 in the R package limma version 3.16.3 to get differential transcript estimates and variances, then combined the estimates and variances across draws using the multiple imputation combining rules23 to get our final fold change (FC) estimates and P-values for each comparison of interest. This approach accounts for uncertainty about the transcript counts, which in general are not directly observed.  Reverse transcriptase PCR BM cells were isolated from healthy subjects (n=2), SF3B1 mutant (n=2) and WT (n=2) RARS/-T patients and used as a source of RNA. RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA II (Macherey-Nagel, Bethlehem, PA, USA) and converted to cDNA using iScript RT Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). mRNA levels of the SLC25A37 normal and splice variant with a retained intron were measured using specific primer sets.24 Amplified PCR products were visualized using a 1.2% agarose gel. Top of page Results SF3B1-mutant RARS/-T patients showed more abundant iron deposits in the mitochondria We analyzed the iron profile of SF3B1 mutant (n=25) and WT (n=8) RARS patients, finding no difference in iron parameters like ferritin (1244 ng/ml±926 vs 1215 ng/ml±1065) and total iron-binding capacity (252 μg/dl±80 vs 234 μg/dl±50). Traditional iron profile measurements do not accurately reflect intracellular iron status. Focusing our attention on the ultrastructure of BM cells derived from RARS patients, we previously reported the presence of more iron deposits in SF3B1 mutant compared with WT RARS patients using TEM.12 In order to test whether SF3B1 mutations lead to iron overload in cells of RARS/-T patients, we isolated fresh BMMNCs from SF3B1 WT (n=2) and mutant (n=3) RARS/-T patients and analyzed stained sections for elemental composition, iron chemical status and oxidation state of iron by using a microanalysis technique, which combines STEM, XEDS and EELS. As illustrated in the representative case in Figures 1a and b, the patient carrying SF3B1 mutation (K700E) showed more iron deposits in the mitochondria (white spots indicated with arrows) compared with the WT RARS/-T patient. A dark-field STEM image depicts the presence and configuration of iron deposits in the mitochondria as evidenced by visualizing the outer membrane of the mitochondria in an erythroblast of an SF3B1-mutant patient (Figure 1c). Iron appears as a perinuclear ring of blue granules by traditional Prussian blue staining. Prussian blue staining identified 68% of RS in the BM (Figure 1d). Figure 1.

TEM analysis on BM sections (1 μm) shows abundant iron deposits in an SF3B1 mutant (a) compared with WT (b) (white arrow). (c) STEM image shows that iron deposits are localized in the mitochondria of cells from an SF3B1-mutant RARS patient. (d) Light microscopy image of a Prussian blue stained BM aspirate of a patient with RARS shows that iron-laden mitochondria appears in the shape of perinuclear blue granules in the erythroid precursors. RS were scored as 68%. Electron micrographs were taken with a Gatan Orius CCD digital camera.  Full figure and legend (169K)  Divalent iron (Fe2+) is the most prevalent iron form of the iron deposits in RARS/-T patients In order to clarify the chemical status of iron in its mitochondrial deposits of BMMNCs in SF3B1 mutant and WT RARS/-T patients, we compared their STEM images (Figures 2a and d). XEDS was used to confirm the presence of iron in the deposits by comparing the area of iron deposits (area #1; Figure 2a) to the other area in the cell (area #2; Figure 2a). As shown in Figures 2b and e, XEDS identified a spectrum of elements present in the scanning area. Both areas contained nickel, cadmium and lead resulting from the staining procedures, and oxygen and carbon, which represent organic materials. Iron was detected in the area of interest (area #1) (Figures 2b and e) and was absent in area #2 (Figure 2c) confirming that the presence of iron was specific. Except for oxygen, carbon and iron, all others elements were used in the staining process to enhance the image contrast and maintain the stability of the sample under high current electron beam. Iron was also shown in cells of WT RARS patients (Figures 2d and e) but at lower intensity and amounts when compared with mutant patient (Figure 2b). The elemental composition of the iron deposits in SF3B1 mutant and WT RARS patients were similar (Figures 2b and e). Microanalysis of iron deposits using EELS showed that the spectrum peak is close to 708 eV, the peak shape and position confirm the presence of divalent iron (Fe2+) in the deposits (Figure 2f). We also compared the peak and shape of the iron found in the deposits of erythroblasts from RARS/-T with the ones of the iron in different elements and prove that both peak and shape identified Fe2+ (Supplementary Figures S1a and b).25 Figure 2.

A dark-field STEM image shows the presence of deposits in SF3B1 mutant (a) and WT (d). (b, e) Chemical analysis of iron deposits by X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry confirmed the presence of iron (Fe) peak in area 1 (orange rectangle) (b, c) compared with area 2 (blue rectangle). Area 2 was used as negative control and no iron deposits were found (c). (f) EELS spectrum of Fe deposits is close to 708 eV and confirms that the iron deposits are ferrous ions (Fe2+) in SF3B1 mutant and WT patients. Electron micrographs were taken with a Gatan Orius CCD digital camera.  Full figure and legend (136K)  SF3B1 mutations lead to divalent iron overload in the mitochondria of RARS/-T patients We next compared the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic iron content between SF3B1 mutant and WT RARS/-T patients using a flow cytometric approach. BMMNCs were loaded with two iron-binding fluorochromes, like calcein-AM and rhodamine B. Dot plots illustrate the percentage of rhodamine B and calcein-AM-labeled cells from a representative SF3B1 WT and mutant patient. For calcein-AM-positive cells, two live gates (O4 and P) were set based on the presence of two populations with different fluorescence (Figure 3a, upper panels). BMMNCs from SF3B1 mutant (n=3) accumulate more cytoplasmic chelatable iron as shown by a slight increase in the percentage of calcein-AM-positive cells compared with WT RARS patients (n=3), although this increase was not statistically significant (P gate: 57.4%±21.4 vs 38.4%±11.1; P=0.24). Using rhodamine B, we analyzed the mitochondrial iron content and found that SF3B1 mutant (n=4) has significantly higher amount of mitochondrial iron as shown by an increase in the percentage of rhodamine B-positive cells (82.3%±10.2 vs 23.6%±14.9; P=0.004) compared with WT RARS patients (n=2) (Figure 3b). As an internal control, calcein-AM and rhodamine B fluorescence were measured in BMMNCs from healthy subjects (n=3) and were found to be at lower levels compared with patients cells (calcein-AM: 1.50%±0.53; rhodamine B: 0.87±0.29) (data not shown). We then chemically modified in-house a commercially available rhodamine B as already reported.15 Modified rhodamine B (RhoNox-1) is a selective fluorescent probe for divalent iron (Fe2+). We first treated BMMNCs from an SF3B1 mutant and WT RARS patient with FeO4S (100 μm), as exogenous source of divalent iron for 30 min and thereafter utilized RhoNox-1 (2 μm) in order to detect endogenous labile divalent iron. As shown in Figures 4a and b, an increase in the basal level of mitochondrial labile Fe2+ was found in the SF3B1 mutant vs WT patient in RhoNox-1-labeled untreated cells (geometric mean fluorescence index: 32.1 vs 24.9; 1.28-fold) and in RhoNox-1-labeled FeO4S-treated cells (geometric mean fluorescence index: 55.7 vs 33.9; 1.64-fold) confirming our previous results and also suggesting that SF3B1 mutants might be more sensitive to exogenous supply of iron.

Full figure and legend (53K)  ROS and DNA damage were not increased in SF3B1 mutant compared with SF3B1 WT RARS/-T patients We and others have reported that SF3B1 mutant show better clinical outcomes compared with WT RARS patients.10, 12, 16 With the intent of explaining the biological rationale of better outcomes in SF3B1 mutants, we focused our attention in elucidating the consequences of iron overload. Accumulation of labile iron can cause cellular and DNA damage. Using flow cytometry, we measured phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX) as a marker of double-strand DNA breaks. Increased percentages in the number of γ-H2AX-positive cells proportionally correspond to increased DNA damage. We found that PB or BM cells from SF3B1 mutant (n=8; BM/PB=4/4) have significant less DNA damage compared with WT (n=3; BM/PB=2/1) RARS patients, and healthy subjects (n=4; BM/PB=4/0) as shown by the lower percentage of γ-H2AX-positive cells (4.19±4.34 vs 12.2±4.33 vs 6.15±3.74; P=0.01) (Figure 5a). Iron overload leads to the increased production of ROS, especially hydroxyl radicals. Using a CellROX green reagent, we did not find a difference in ROS levels between SF3B1 mutant (n=4) and WT (n=3) RARS/-T patients in normal conditions (93.8±7.9 vs 83.2±15.9; P=0.35). Similarly, we did not find any difference under conditions of oxidative stress by stimulating the cells with H2O2 (90.4±14.3 vs 70.4±40.0; P=0.46) (Figure 5b). Figure 5.

Full figure and legend (54K)  SF3B1 mutations lead to alternative usage of a specific isoform of SLC25A37 (Mitoferrin-1) It has been reported that SF3B1 mutations affect genes of the mitochondrial network.12, 26 Since SF3B1 is a splicing factor, it may elicit its effect by affecting the regulation of downstream targets via alternative splicing. We thus performed RNA-Seq analysis of BM cells from three SF3B1 mutant (K700E, n=2; H662Q, n=1), three WT RARS patients and three healthy subjects. A comprehensive bioinformatic analysis was conducted on three levels: gene, transcript and exon. Global differential gene expression analysis detected changes in 45 genes (false discovery rate<0.1) between SF3B1 mutant and healthy subjects. No genes showed differential expression (false discovery rate<0.1) between SF3B1 mutant and WT RARS patients (Supplementary Table S1). Known key players in the pathogenesis of SA were interrogated: ALAS2 was upregulated in SF3B1 mutant vs WT RARS patients (FC=1.46) and in SF3B1 mutant vs healthy subjects (FC=1.72). ABCB7 was downregulated compared with healthy subjects in both groups (FC=0.42, P=0.037 for SF3B1 mutants and FC=0.49, P=0.044 for WT RARS) in accordance with previously published data in the literature.3 Global differential exon usage analysis detected 271 genes (Supplementary Table S2) with at least one exon showing changes in differential usage (false discovery rate<0.10) between SF3B1 mutants and WT RARS patients. This analysis showed that one of the top candidate genes was SLC25A37 (P=4.7e−4, false discovery rate=0.089). An increased mRNA expression level of SLC25A37 was found in SF3B1 mutant (red line) compared with WT (blue line) RARS/-T patients (FC=1.98) (Figure 6a) as well as compared with healthy subjects (FC=3.31), although neither comparison was significant. Differential transcript analysis showed that SLC25A37 transcript ENST00000518881 (Ensembl transcript id), which contains a retained intron, was more highly expressed in SF3B1 mutants vs WT RARS patients (FC=5.6, P=0.034) and vs healthy subjects (FC=22.7, P=2.6e−4) (Figure 6b). This transcript was expressed on average at about a tenth of the level of SLC25A37’s major protein-coding transcript (ENST00000519973), which is relatively abundant and in contrast did not show evidence of differential transcript expression. A representative scheme of the major protein-coding transcript and the transcript with a retained intron is shown in Figure 6c. The differences in expression levels of the SLC25A37 isoform in SF3B1 mutant, SF3B1 WT and healthy subjects were further confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR (Supplementary Figure S2). SLC25A37 is a gene located on chromosome 8p21.2 with a full-length cDNA composed by 4 exons and 12 known transcripts, two of which are protein coding. Sanger sequencing of SLC25A37 coding region did not detect any somatic mutations in a total of 33 patients (SF3B1 mutant/WT: 21/12). SLC25A37 or better known as Mitoferrin-1 is a protein localized in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, which acts as importer of Fe2+ into the mitochondria in erythroid precursors. SLC25A37 protein has been linked to FECH and Abcb10 in the regulation of the erythroid heme biosynthesis.27 A known transcription factor GATA-1, which represents a marker of hematopoietic maturation, seems to regulate the import of Fe2+ by SLC25A37. We found a trend toward increased mRNA expression levels of ABCB10 (FC=2.27), FECH (FC=1.43) and GATA-1 (FC=1.55) in SF3B1 mutant vs WT RARS/-T patients, although none of them reached statistical significance. There were no significant differences in the levels of any of the RNA-variant transcripts of ABCB7 and ALAS2.  Figure 6.

Full figure and legend (192K)  We also investigated other genes important in iron metabolism in congenital SA including SLC25A38, PUS-1 and GLRX5 but no differences in exon usage, gene expression and RNA-variant transcripts were noted, supporting the differences in the pathogenesis of iron accumulation between acquired and congenital SA.  Top of page Discussion Ring sideroblasts (RS) are erythroid precursors containing iron deposits, most commonly detected by Prussian blue staining and visualized by light microscopy as a perinuclear ring of blue granules. TEM clarified that these deposits are specifically localized in the mitochondria of erythroid precursors. RS are present in 25% of patients with MDS and rarely seen in other conditions. This feature is a diagnostic criterion of RARS/-T. In 2011, the discovery of mutations in a pre-mRNA splicing factor called splicing factor 3b, subunit 1 (SF3B1) in 60–82% of RARS/-T patients added an additional molecular criterion to identify RARS/-T subtypes. We reported that SF3B1 haploinsufficiency leads to the RS phenotype in MDS and other non-MDS BM failure conditions, and we studied the potential link between SF3B1 mutations and the mitochondrial pathways and how it contributes to the disease biology and phenotype.12, 26, 28, 29, 30 Other studies suggested the relationship between SF3B1 mutations and mitochondrial proteins but did not delve into the specific mechanisms or pathways that contribute to iron accumulation or disease phenotype in SF3B1-mutant MDS.10, 31 Using TEM, we found that within RARS/-T, sideroblasts of SF3B1-mutant patients have distinct ultrastructural iron distribution characterized by abundant iron deposits compared with those of WT patients.12 In the present manuscript, we confirmed that TEM is able to detect a difference in the iron content between mutant and WT RARS/-T patients not appreciated by conventional Prussian blue staining. The finding led us to think that the differences in iron is connected with the differences in better survival outcomes of SF3B1 mutant vs WT RARS/-T patients.10, 12, 16 Thus, we hypothesized that SF3B1 mutations may have effects on downstream targets implicated in the Fenton reaction whereby ferrous iron (Fe2+) is converted in ferric iron (Fe3+) via superoxide ion. It has been reported that SF3B1 mutations might affect the mitochondrial network inducing iron accumulation at different levels.32 We used XEDS/EELS techniques, which have the power to qualitatively and quantitatively discriminate the presence of specific elements, primarily used in the evaluation of surface materials. This is the first time that both techniques were used to elucidate the iron characteristics in a hematologic neoplasm like MDS, specifically in RARS/-T. This is an important distinction from the two prior studies that used both techniques separately and consequently affects the results and conclusions of those studies. In the two previously published papers,33, 34 the authors concluded that ferric iron (Fe3+) was the most prevalent form of iron. The difference between Fe2+ and Fe3+ is very narrow and is highly dependent on the spectral intensity and the peak shape of the iron. The differences in spectral intensity between Fe2+ and Fe3+ can be appreciated by looking at the major and minor peaks (L3 and L2) of iron. For the L3 peak, the expected spectral intensity of Fe2+ edge peak has a maximum occurring at 707.5 eV while the expected Fe3+ edge major peak occurs at 710 eV. For the L2 peak, the expected spectral intensity of Fe2+ edge peak has a maximum of ~720 eV while the expected Fe3+ edge peak is beyond 720 usually at the range of 722–723 eV.25 In addition to the observed chemical shifts, the distinction between Fe2+ and Fe3+ is also dependent on the L2 and L3 edge shapes. Based on these chemical properties, we again confirmed that ferrous iron (Fe2+) is the most prevalent form of iron present in the cellular iron deposits of either SF3B1 mutant or WT RARS/-T (Figure 2). Using flow cytometry, we verified that the increased amount of iron in SF3B1-mutant patients was more pronounced in the mitochondria compared with the cytoplasm. In addition, we used a modified fluorescent dye (RhoNox-1), which is able to specifically recognize only Fe2+, and confirmed that the deposits in SF3B1 mutant and WT patients contain divalent iron. In normal physiologic acid base and oxygen tension states, Fe2+ is soluble and oxidized to Fe3+, which when hydrolyzed, leads to the formation of insoluble Fe3+ hydroxides, which have redox activity and capacity to induce damage. In our study, the oxidative stress measured by ROS levels was not different between SF3B1 mutant and WT RARS/-T patients suggesting that oxidative stress is similar irrespective of the cause of mitochondrial iron overload. Furthermore, the lower levels of double-stranded DNA damage observed in SF3B1 mutant compared with SF3B1 WT RARS/-T patients and healthy subjects may be due to upregulated antioxidant defenses and DNA repair mechanisms in the BM progenitors of patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  We thus utilized RNA-Seq as the best methodology to appreciate the effects of SF3B1 on other pathways. When we interrogated genes with mitochondrial function or location, their mRNA expression levels were significantly different between SF3B1 mutant, WT RARS/-T patients and healthy subjects. As many known iron transport systems are located within the mitochondrial machinery, we first focused our analysis on genes with relevant iron transport functions. Interestingly, the mRNA level of SLC25A37 (Mitoferrin-1), a protein implicated in the mitochondrial iron delivery in erythroid cells, was found to be significantly overexpressed in SF3B1 mutant compared with both WT RARS/-T patients and healthy subjects. It has been shown that iron accumulation, heme and iron sulfur cluster synthesis are reduced by silencing SLC25A37 in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts.35 Our study provides some new answers to the queries surrounding the formation of RS in RARS/-T as previously proposed when SF3B1 mutations were first linked to the formation of RS.12 It was speculated that SF3B1 mutations lead to iron accumulation by affecting several key iron trafficking pathways including ABCB7, protoporphyrin IX, FECH, iron sulfur cluster proteins and mitochondrial electron respiratory chain.32 In our study, none of these pathways were significantly different between SF3B1 mutant and WT RARS/-T patients suggesting that other distinct mechanisms may be responsible for these changes. Through the application of a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis in RARS/-T subtypes, we identified a statistically significant increase in a specific RNA splice variant of SLC25A37 with a retained intron in SF3B1 mutant compared with WT RARS/-T patients and healthy individuals. This finding is important because, through a novel bioinformatic approach of RNA-sequencing analysis, we were the first to identify and link an alternatively spliced mitochondrial gene in MDS with RS. Alternative splicing, presence of splice products and intron retention have been identified in several human disorders and may be used as a diagnostic marker of diseases.36 It is of further interest that intron retention is the least frequent alternative splicing outcome.37 Wang et al.24 speculated that the presence of an abnormal transcript of SLC25A37 containing an insert of intron 2 with a stop codon contributes to the phenotype observed in some variants of erythropoietic protoporphyria that do not carry the typical FECH mutation, ALAS2 mutation and FECH polymorphism. In this study Wang et al. found that erythropoietic protoporphyria patients with increased abnormal SLC25A37 expression have reduced FECH activity. Our study investigated the role of SLC25A37 in a disease with a different natural history from erythropoietic protoporphyria in which no differences in FECH were found. The invariable presence of SLC25A37 intron retention in our SF3B1-mutated cases suggests that it was under positive selection because of its functionality. The presence of this abundant isoform of SLC25A37 suggests that the iron delivered into the mitochondria is altered in SF3B1-mutant RARS/-T patients. Our data also indicate that SF3B1 mutations may induce deregulation of crucial iron importers that work at the initial steps in the delivery of iron into the mitochondria rather than in the successive steps of iron incorporation. The specific splice variant with a retained intron of SLC25A37 may translate to a truncated protein that can be a novel mediator of iron overload in SF3B1 mutant RARS/-T patients and a potential therapeutic target in MDS with SF3B1 mutations. Indeed, the predictive putative protein translated from ENST00000518881 would have 218 amino acids and would retain the first 70 amino-acid residues of the WT protein. Conventional protein properties tools (UniProt2 and ProteinPredict) show that this mutant protein would have an altered three dimensional structure with features of higher level of structural disorder. However, the protein would retain the ability to anchor the inner mitochondrial membrane. Moreover, it will probably not affect the function of Abcb10, as it would retain the Abcb10-binding motif of the WT SLC25A37 protein.38 Finally, a plausible speculation about the function for this neomorphic protein would be a role in Fe2+ storage in the mitochondria similar to that of frataxin. SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF35 (U2AF1) are the three most frequent genes involved with spliceosome mutations in myeloid malignancies. SF3B1 mutations are most frequent (~80%) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts (RS) but lack prognostic relevance. SRSF2 mutations are associated with shortened overall (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in both MDS and myelofibrosis. In this study of 226 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), mutational frequencies were 40% for SRSF2 (all affecting P95), 6% for SF3B1 (primarily K700E) and 9% for U2AF35 (mostly S34F and Q157P/R). These mutations were mutually exclusive and 54% of the patients displayed at least one mutation. The three mutation groups were phenotypically similar, with the exception of higher RS% (P < 0.0001) in patients with SF3B1 mutations. At a median follow-up of 15 months, 176 (78%) deaths and 32 (14%) leukemic transformations were documented. OS (median survivals of 17, 16, 17, and 20 months; P = 0.48) and LFS (leukemic transformation rates of 17, 13, 15, and 5%; P = 0.63) were similar among patients with none of the three mutations, SRSF2, SF3B1, or U2AF35 mutations, respectively. We conclude that SRSF2 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene in CMML but neither it nor SF3B1 or U2AF35 mutations are prognostically relevant. Am. J. Hematol. 88:201–206, 2013. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Introduction  Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by features overlapping between myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). The 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for diagnosis of CMML include; persistent peripheral blood monocytosis >1 × 10(9)/L, absence of the BCR-ABL1 fusion, absence of rearrangements of the PDGFRA or PDGFRB genes, absence of ≥20% myeloblasts or promonocytes in the blood and bone marrow (BM), and presence of dysplasia in one or more myeloid lineages [1]. CMML is further subclassified into CMML-1 (<5% circulating blasts and <10% BM blasts) and CMML-2 (5–19% circulating blasts, 10–19% BM blasts, or when Auer rods are present irrespective of the blast count), with the median over-all survival (OS) being ~20 and 15 months respectively [1, 2].  Genetic aberrations are common in CMML and tend to involve different cellular targets and epigenetic regulatory pathways. These include mutations involving; RUNX1 [3], IDH1, and IDH2 [4], KRAS and NRAS [5], CBL [6], JAK2 [7], TET2 [8], DNMT3A [9], ASXL1 [10], UTX [9], and EZH2 [9]. Thus far, in CMML, loss-of-function mutations involving EZH2 and ASXL1 have been associated with poor outcomes [10, 11]. The data with regard to the other mutations needs further elucidation.  Mutations in genes of the splicing machinery, such as SF3B1 (splicing factor 3B, subunit 1), SRSF2 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2) and U2AF35, also known as U2AF1 (U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor) are common in patients with myeloid malignancies [12-14]. SF3B1 mutations have a high prevalence (~80%) in MDS and ring sideroblasts (RS) and do not influence either OS or leukemia-free survival (LFS) [15, 16]. Similarly, these mutations are seen in a small fraction (<10%) of patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), are strongly associated with the presence of BM RS, but do not affect disease outcome [17]. SRSF2 mutations are seen in patients with MDS, CMML, MPN/PMF, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [12, 13, 16, 18-20], and are very rare in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia [19, 21]. In MDS and PMF, SRSF2 mutations are relatively common (~15–20%) and are associated with shortened OS and LFS [16, 18, 22]. In CMML, SRSF2 is the most commonly mutated spliceosome gene (28–47%) and has been associated with older age, less pronounced anemia and a diploid karyotype [13, 14, 19, 20]. Thus far, in CMML, SRSF2 mutations have not been shown to carry an independent prognostic impact [14]. U2AF35 mutations areseen in ~10% of patients with MDS, CMML, therapy related, and secondary AML and have not clearly been associated with an independent prognostic impact [13, 19]. This study involves a relatively large number of patients with WHO-defined CMML and its objective was to evaluate the prevalence, clinical correlates, and prognostic relevance of SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF35 mutations. Materials and Methods  This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic institutional review board. Study eligibility criteria included availability of peripheral blood (PB) smear, BM histology, and cytogenetic information at time of referral to the Mayo Clinic. The diagnoses of CMML, including subclassification into CMML-1 or CMML-2, and documentation regarding the presence or absence of RS and leukemic transformation were according to the WHO criteria [1]. All BM slides, including iron stains for quantification of BM RS were centrally reviewed. Karyotype risk designation and risk stratification were according to the Spanish cytogenetic risk stratification system [23] and the MD Anderson prognostic scoring system (MDAPS) [24], respectively.  DNA from BM or PB was extracted using conventional methods. SF3B1 mutational analysis (SF3B1exons 13–15) was performed according to previously published methods [25]. For detection of SRSF2 and U2AF35 mutations, we applied standard PCR techniques and bidirectional sequencing. For U2AF35, we amplified two areas with known mutations that included residues S34 and Q157 [13]. Briefly, two separate PCR reactions were performed and the primers used were as follows: (for S34) Forward: 5′-GGTGCTTAATACCACGGAAAA-3′; Reverse: 5′-AGTCGATCACCTGCCTCACT-3′; (for Q157) Forward: 5′-GCCTCGTGTGCATTCTCTG-3′; Reverse: 5′-CTTTTCAGTTTCGCCGTGAG-3′. PCR amplification conditions were the same for both U2AF35 reactions and included a primary denaturation of 95°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of: 95°C for 30 sec, 57°C for 45 sec, and 72°C for 45 sec; and ended with a final extension of 72°C for 5 min. Products were purified before sequencing.  For SRSF2, we applied a nested PCR specific for the area around mutational hotspot residue P95 in exon 1. Primers used included: (for 1st PCR) Forward: 5′-CAAGGTGGACAACCTGACCT-3′; Reverse: 5′-AGACGCCATTTCCCCAGT-3′; (for 2nd PCR) Forward: 5′-GTGGACAACCTGACCTACCG-3′; and Reverse: 5′-CCTCAGCCCCGTTTACCT-3′. Products were purified after both rounds of PCR and 1uL of the product from first PCR was used as template for the second round. Both rounds of PCR were amplified using the same conditions and consisted of: denaturation at 95°C for 10 min followed by 35 cycles of: denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at 56°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min; with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.  All statistical analyses considered clinical and laboratory parameters obtained at time of referral to the Mayo Clinic, which in most instances coincided with time of BM biopsy at the Mayo Clinic and study sample collection. Differences in the distribution of continuous variables between categories were analyzed by either Mann-Whitney (for comparison of two groups) or Kruskal-Wallis (comparison of three or more groups) test. Patient groups with nominal variables were compared by chi-square test. Overall survival was calculated from the date of first referral to date of death (uncensored) or last contact (censored). LFS was calculated from the date of first referral to date of leukemic transformation (uncensored) or death/last contact (censored). Overall and LFS curves were prepared by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for multivariable analysis. P values <0.05 were considered significant. The Stat View (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) statistical package was used for all calculations. Results  Two hundred and twenty-six patients with WHO defined CMML and who were seen at the Mayo Clinic from 1997 to 2007 were included in this study. The median age of the cohort was 71 years (range, 20–90 years), with 67% of the patients being males. Table 1 outlines the presenting clinical and laboratory features and subsequent events in the 226 study patients with CMML, stratified by PB and BM blasts and % BM RS. One hundred and ninety-one patients (84%) had CMML-1 with a median OS of 21 months, while 35 patients had CMML-2 with a median OS of 15 months. Accurate information with regards to the different treatment strategies used in these patients was not available. Thirty patients (13%) received erythropoietic stimulating agents, 15 (7%) received induction type chemotherapy (anthracycline + cytarabine), 20 (9%) received hypomethylating agents (5-Azacytidine-n = 14 and decitabine-n = 6), while 5 (2%) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

The corresponding mutational frequencies in CMML-1/CMML-2 were 40/37, 5/9, and 10/3%. One-hundred and twenty-three (54%) patients had at least one of the three spliceosome mutations: 55% in CMML-1 and 66% in CMML-2. Notably, all three spliceosome mutations were mutually exclusive.  The mutational spectrum for SRSF2 included P95L in 38 (42%) of the 90 SRSF2-mutated patients, P95H in 32 (35%), and P95R in 12 (13%) (Table 2). P95 was also a frequent site for deletions and insertions; delP95R-R102 in 7 (8%) and R94-P95insR in 1 (1%) patient. Thirty patients (33%) with SRSF2 mutations had ≥1% BM RS, of which 58% had < 15% RS, 42% had 15–49% RS, while none of the patients had ≥50% RS. Neither of the above SRSF2 mutation types correlated with BM RS%. Fifty six (62%) patients among the 90 SRSF2-mutated cohort had a diploid karyotype whereas trisomy 8 (n = 5), monosomy 7/deletion 7q (n = 4,), −y (n = 4), deletion 20q (n= 2), complex karyotype (n = 2), monosomal karyotype (n = 1), trisomy 11 (n = 1), deletion 13q (n = 1), and isochromosome 17q (n = 1) were included among the abnormal cytogenetic findings in the remaining. Karyotypic risk categories based on the Spanish cytogenetic risk stratification system were; 11 (12%) high risk, 19 (21%) intermediate risk and 60 (63%) low risk. Risk stratification based on the MDAPS was as follows; 5 (6%) high risk, 18 (20%) intermediate-2 risk, 28 (31%) intermediate-1 risk, and 40 (44%) low risk. To date, among the 90 SRSF2-mutated patients, 74 (82%) deaths and 12 (13%) leukemic transformations have been recorded; the median survival of patients with SRSF2 mutations was 16 months and the leukemic transformation rate was 13%.

Nine (69%) of the 13 SF3B1-mutated patients had ≥ 1% BM RS, of which 3% had <15% RS, 26% had 15–49% RS and 43% had >50% RS. There was a strong correlation between SF3B1 mutations and increased BM RS% (P < 0.0001). Seven patients (54%) among the SF3B1-mutated cohort had a diploid karyotype, one patient had trisomy 8, and there were no patients with a complex/monosomal karyotype. Karyotypic risk categories in this group of SF3B1-mutated patients, based on the Spanish cytogenetic risk stratification system were; 1 (8%) high risk, 5 (38%) intermediate risk, and 7 (54%) low risk. Risk stratification based on the MDAPS was; 1 (8%) high risk, 3 (23%) intermediate-2 risk, 3 (23%) intermediate-1 risk, and 6 (46%) low risk. The median survival of patients with SF3B1 mutations was 17 months, and to date, 12 (92%) deaths and 2 (15%) leukemic transformations have been recorded.  The mutational hot spots for U2AF35 included S34F in 8 (40%) of the 20 U2AF35-mutated patients, Q157P in 5 (25%), Q157R in 5 (25%), Q157G in 1(5%), and R158H in 1(5%) (Table 2). Five (8%) patients among this mutation group had ≥1% BM RS, of which 8% had <15% RS, 11% had 15–49% RS and 0% had >50% RS. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 U2AF35-mutated patients had a diploid karyotype, 2 (10%) had a monosomal karyotype, while one patient had isochromosome 14q; karyotypic risk categories based on the Spanish cytogenetic risk stratification system were; 2 (10%) high risk, 1 (5%) intermediate risk, and 17 (85%) low risk. Risk stratification based on the MDAPS was; 1 (5%) high risk, 3 (15%) intermediate-2 risk, 5 (25%) intermediate-1 risk, and 11 (55%) low risk. The median survival of patients with U2AF35 mutations was 20 months, and to date, 13 (65%) deaths and 1 (5%) leukemic transformation have been recorded.  There was no statistically significant difference, among the three mutation groups (SRSF2 vs. SF3B1 vs. U2AF35), in prognostically relevant parameters, including gender distribution, median age, hemoglobin values, absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), absolute monocyte counts (AMC), platelet counts, PB, and BM blast counts, WHO histological subcategories (CMML-1 vs. CMML-2), and circulating immature myeloid cells. The only notable difference was that patients with the SF3B1 mutations had a higher BM RS% (P < 0.0001), lower median white blood cell count (P= 0.04), and a lower absolute lymphocyte count (P=0.045).  At a median follow-up of 15 months, considering all 226 patients, 176 (78%) deaths, and 32 (14%) leukemic transformations were documented. In univariate analysis, the presence of SRSF2 (P = 0.67), SF3B1 (P = 0.96), or U2AF35 (P = 0.49) mutations had no prognostic impact on OS (Fig. 1). Similarly, none of the three spliceosome mutations affected LFS; corresponding P values were 0.55 for SRSF2, 0.9 for SF3B1, and 0.38 for U2AF35 mutations, respectively (Fig. 2). We then examined possible prognostic value of having none of these mutations (n = 104) vs. otherwise (n = 123) and the results were again negative (P= 0.87).  Figure 1.  Figure 1.

[Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.] Discussion  The advent of next generation sequencing technology has led to the identification of molecular aberrations in ~90% of patients with CMML [9, 14, 26]. These can broadly be divided into four categories: mutations involving epigenetic regulator genes such as EZH2, ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1, and IDH2 [9, 10, 14, 27], mutations involving the spliceosome machinery such as SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF35, ZRSR2, SF3A1, PRPF40B, U2AF65, and SF1 [13, 14, 19, 20], mutations involving DNA damage response genes such as Tp53 [28], and mutations involving genes regulating cellular/receptor tyrosine kinases and transcription factors such as JAK2, KRAS, NRAS, and RUNX1 [26, 29]. Thus far, in CMML loss of function gene mutations involving ASXL1 and EZH2 have been associated with poor outcome [10, 11].  Recently, mutations involving the spliceosome machinery have been described in patients with myeloid neoplasms, including MDS, CMML, MPN, and AML [12, 13, 17, 18, 30]. Spliceosome aberrations have also been described in solid tumors, examples being recurrent somatic mutations of U2AF35 in adenocarcinoma of the lung [31], and overexpression of SRSF1 and SRSF2 in both adeno and squamous cell lung cancers [32]. All of the above mentioned spliceosome factors are involved in a 3′-splice site recognition of pre-mRNA, including abnormal/alternative splicing. The U2 auxiliary factor that consists of the U2AF65-U2AF35 heterodimer, establishes physical interaction with SF1 and a serine/arginine rich protein such as SRSF1 or SRSF2, resulting in recognition of the 3′ splice site and its nearby polypyrimidine tract [13]. This leads to the subsequent recruitment of U2 snRNP, containing SF3A1 and SF3B1 to establish the splicing A complex [13]. ZRSR2 has a close structural similarity to U2AF35 and is an essential component of the splicing machinery [13].  Mutations involving SF3B1 are common in MDS-RS (~80%), and to a lesser extent in PMF (<10%), but hold no independent prognostic value [12, 17, 25]. These mutations have a strong phenotypic correlation with the presence of BM RS. Mutations involving SRSF2 are frequent in CMML (28–47%) [13, 14, 19, 20] and can also be seen in MDS (~12%) [13, 16], PMF(~17%), [18] and therapy related/secondary AML (~7%) [13]. In MDS and PMF, SRSF2 mutations negatively influence both OS and LFS [16, 18]. In CMML, Meggendorfer et al. recently reported a prevalence of 47% for SRSF2 mutations in 275 patients, and found that these mutations did not affect OS or LFS [14]. U2AF35 mutations are rare in MDS, but can be seen in CMML (10–13%) [13, 19], MPN (2%), and therapy related/secondary AML (~10%) [13]. The prognostic impact of these mutations in myeloid neoplasms remains to be elucidated [19].  In our comprehensive spliceosome mutational analysis of 226 patients with WHO-defined CMML, we identified 123 patients (54%) to have a mutation involving SRSF2, SF3B1, or U2AF35. We confirmed that these mutations were mutually exclusive. SRSF2 mutations were seen in 40% of cases (100% with P95 as a mutational hotspot), while SF3B1 (primarily K700E) and U2AF35 mutations (mostly S34F and Q157P/R) were seen in 6 and 9%, respectively. Consistent with other studies, SRSF2 mutations exclusively occurred at P95 within an intervening sequence between the RNA recognition motif and arginine/serine-rich domain [13, 14]. The reason why P95 lends itself to be a mutational hot spot is currently unknown. The three analyzed spliceosomal gene mutations did not have any specific correlation with age, gender, ANC, AMC, PB, or BM blasts, WHO histological subcategories (CMML-1 vs. CMML-2) or specific karyotypic abnormalities. Patients with SF3B1 mutations did have a higher % of BM RS, lower median white count and a lower ALC, perhaps indicators of less aggressive disease. There were no differences in the distribution of patients across the Spanish cytogenetic risk stratification and the MDAPS risk categories [23, 24].  RS are erythroid precursors with iron-laden mitochondria forming a perinuclear ring and are common in patients with myeloid neoplasms, including MDS, MPN, and MDS/MPN overlap syndromes [1, 17, 33]. The presence of ≥15% RS constitutes the operational diagnosis of MDS-RS [33]. Sixty-four (28%) of the study patients had ≥1% RS, with 41% of these having ≥ 15% RS. Thirty (33%) patients with SRSF2 mutations had ≥1% RS, with 13 (43%) demonstrating ≥15% RS. There were 4 patients in the study with >50% BM RS and all 4 (100%) had SF3B1 mutations, confirming a strong phenotypic correlation with this mutation. Five (25%) patients with U2AF35 mutations had ≥1% BM RS, with 2 (40%) having ≥15% BM RS. These observations suggest that SF3B1 mutations play a dominant but not exclusive role in the pathogenesis of RS.  In addition to participating in the splicing process, SRSF2 is known to be involved in the regulation of DNA stability [34]. It has been shown that depletion of SRSF2 results in genomic instability; triggering significant double stranded DNA breaks [35]. In fact, SRSF2 mutations have been associated with a higher number of mutations of other genes in comparison to other spliceosomal mutations [13]. This is the proposed mechanism by which SRSF2 mutations have been thought to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with myeloid neoplasms, namely MDS and PMF [16, 18]. Contrary to these findings, our study has demonstrated that neither SRSF2 mutations nor mutations involving SF3B1 or U2AF35 impact prognosis (OS and LFS) in CMML. Furthermore, it provides evidence for a limited genotype-phenotype association, save for the already established association between SF3B1 mutations and RS The splicing factor SF3B1 is the most commonly mutated gene in the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), particularly in patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS). We investigated the functional effects of SF3B1 disruption in myeloid cell lines: SF3B1 knockdown resulted in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and impaired erythroid differentiation and deregulation of many genes and pathways, including cell cycle regulation and RNA processing. MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared with wild-type cases include genes that are involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1 and CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7 and SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8 and HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. This is the first study to determine the target genes of SF3B1 mutation in MDS CD34+ cells. Our data indicate that SF3B1 has a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link.  Go to: Introduction The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) malignancies characterized by blood cell dysplasia and peripheral blood cytopenia. Approximately 30–40% of MDS patients will develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML).1  The recent discovery of somatic splicesomal mutations in MDS has revealed a new leukemogenic pathway involving spliceosomal dysfunction.2, 3 Somatic mutations in the splicing factor genes SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2 are frequent in MDS patients.4 Importantly, these genes encode proteins that are all involved in 3′-splice site recognition during pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing. Splicing factor gene mutations occur in over 50% of MDS patients, are highly specific to this disorder, and occur in a mutually exclusive manner.5, 6, 7  SF3B1, encoding a core component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, involved in the recognition of the branchpoint sequence, is the most commonly mutated gene found in MDS (20–28% of all patients).2, 8, 9 We and others have shown that mutations of the splicing factor SF3B1 are found in a high percentage (>70%) of MDS patients whose disease is characterised by the presence of ring sideroblasts, including both refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS).2, 8 The close association between SF3B1 mutation and the presence of ring sideroblasts is consistent with a causal relationship and makes this the first gene to be strongly associated with a specific morphological feature of MDS. Ring sideroblasts are characterised by an excess accumulation of iron in the mitochondria of erythroblasts,10 and SF3B1 mutant RARS cases show altered iron distribution characterised by coarse iron deposits compared with wild-type RARS cases.11 SF3B1 mutations are generally more prevalent in low-risk MDS and have been shown to be independent predictors of favorable clinical outcome in MDS in most studies.8, 11 The clinical consequences of SF3B1 mutation in MDS are clear, but the functional consequences of these mutations in human cells remain poorly understood. Altered RNA splicing has been suggested as the mechanism underlying the observed phenotypic changes concomitant to splicing factor gene mutations, including SF3B1; 3, 12, 13 however, the target genes in the HSC of MDS cases with SF3B1 mutations are yet to be defined.  SF3B1 mutations in MDS are primarily heterozygous point mutations. The presence of hotspots and the absence of nonsense or frameshift mutations in SF3B1 in MDS patients suggest that SF3B1 mutations are likely to be gain/change-of-function (neomorphic) mutations. A heterozygous Sf3b1+/− knockout mouse model has been shown to develop ring sideroblasts, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of SF3B1 may lead to their formation.11 Recent similar studies have not made this observation, however.14, 15 Thus, it is yet to be determined whether SF3B1 mutations found in MDS are loss-of-function mutations or gain/change-of-function mutations. In this study, we thus evaluated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell growth, gene expression and splicing in a range of myeloid cell lines and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the CD34+ cells of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  Go to: Materials and methods Myeloid cell lines culture  K562, HEL, TF1 and SKM1 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. TF1 and SKM1 cultures were supplemented with 2 and 1 ng/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, respectively.  SF3B1 knockdown  Three non-overlapping small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting SF3B1 and two different scramble sequences with guanine–cytosine content similar to the siRNA sequences (Stealth Select RNAi, Invitrogen) were used to knock down SF3B1 in myeloid cell lines. For each transfection, 30 pmol of siRNA and 2 × 106 cells were electroporated in an Amaxa Nucleofector I, using the Amaxa cell optimization kit V (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Evaluation of green fluorescent protein-positive cells obtained using the pmaxGFP fluorescent expression plasmid confirmed >80% of successfully transfected cells after 24 h. Readout data are reported as mean±s.e.m. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.  Cell growth assay  Live and dead cells were assessed by trypan blue viability testing and counted using a hemocytometer.  Cell cycle analysis  Cells were fixed with ice cold methanol, incubated with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNaseA, as previously described.16 Data were acquired on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed using FLOWJO software 7.6.4 (FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA).  Erythroid differentiation  To induce erythroid differentiation, K562, TF1 and HEL cells were cultured with hemin 50 μm for 72 h. Erythroid differentiation was studied by analyzing the expression level of γ-globin (HBG1) using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) as described previously.17 Expression of the erythroid markers CD36, CD71 and CD235a was evaluated by flow cytometry as described previously.16  Quantitative real-time PCR  Total RNA was reverse transcribed using Retroscript kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). The expression levels of SF3B1, ABCB7, FTMT, HBG1, KLF1 and B2M were determined using Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). B2M expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input complementary DNA (cDNA). Triplicate samples were run on a LightCycler 480 Real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK) and expression ratios were calculated using the ddCT method.18  Gene expression profiling  Total RNA (100 ng for each sample) was amplified and labeled with the 3′ IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips, as described previously.19, 20 CEL files were pre-processed using Robust Multi-chip Average and data analysis was performed using GeneSpring 7.3.1 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) 7.5 (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), as previously described.19 Analysis of gene set up- or downregulation was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis,21 as previously described (false discovery rate<0.1).2  Splicing analysis using human genome exon-junction microarray  Total RNA was DNAse treated (Invitrogen), purified (Agencourt RNA Clean XP) and amplified (100 ng) using Ambion WT Expression Kit (Affymetrix). The cDNA was subsequently fragmented and labeled using WT terminal labeling kit (Affymetrix). Samples were hybridized onto Affymetrix Human genome exon-junction arrays, which on average contain 119 unique probes per gene spanning every exon and known exon–exon junction. CEL files were analyzed using GenoSplice technology (www.genosplice.com).22, 23 Data were normalized using quantile normalization. Analysis at the exon level was performed taking into account only exon probes. Analysis at the splicing variant level was performed by taking into account exon–exon junction probes using the FAST DB splicing patterns annotation (release fastdb_2012_2). Unpaired Student's t-test was used to determine exon and splicing pattern variation between cells with SF3B1 knockdown and scramble controls. Genes were considered significantly deregulated when fold change was ⩾1.5 and P-value <0.05. Gene Ontology, KEGG and REACTOME analyses of differentially regulated genes were performed using DAVID.24  Splicing analysis using qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing  Splicing analysis of TP53 was performed using Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted individual bands from PCR-amplified cDNA. Primers and PCR conditions are listed in Supplementary Table S1.  Splicing analysis of cyclins CCNA2 and STK6 was performed using a qRT-PCR on cDNA, using primers specific for splice junctions corresponding to exon inclusion or skipping.25 Primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. TBP expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input cDNA.  RNA sequencing  Bone marrow samples were obtained from MDS patients and healthy controls and CD34+ cells isolated using MACS magnetic cell separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), as described previously.19, 20 RNA extracted from bone marrow CD34+ cells obtained from 12 MDS patients and 5 healthy controls was used for deep RNA-Seq. Eight of the 12 MDS cases (four RARS and four RCMD-RS) had SF3B1 gene mutation, whereas four cases (all RCMD) had no known mutations in splicing factor genes (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 or ZRSR2) (Supplementary Table S3), as determined by targeted next-generation sequencing data from a previous study.7  Total RNA was DNase treated (Invitrogen), purified using XP beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and processed (100 ng) using NEBNext Ultra directional mRNA Library prep (NEB, Hitchin, UK) as per the manufacturer's protocol for Illumina with two alterations: custom indexes were designed in house and an additional purification step was performed using XP beads (Beckman Coulter) rather than size selection. Samples were run on HiSeq2000 Illumina sequencing machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome using TopHat,26 which can handle reads spanning exon–exon boundaries. Data analysis was performed using edgeR27 to evaluate the whole transcript expression (false discovery rate<0.05) and with DEXSeq28 to evaluate differential exon usage (false discovery rate<0.05). At the expression level, only genes with at least 10 reads in four or more samples were included in the analysis; at the exon level, exons with fewer than 10 reads were excluded. Gender was included as an additional factor in the DEXSeq model testing for differential exon usage. Selected differentially expressed exons were validated using qRT-PCR (Supplemetary Figure S1, Supplementary Information). Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) v2.3 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) was used for visualization of the sequence reads. Pathway analysis was performed using IPA and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, as described above. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE63569.  Go to: Results SF3B1 knockdown inhibits cell growth, induces cell cycle arrest and impairs erythroid differentiation  SF3B1 was knocked down using siRNA technology in four myeloid cell lines (TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1) that we found to be wild type for SF3B1 (Supplementary Information), resulting in a significant decrease in expression ranging between 50 and 60% (Figure 1a).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting SF3B1 was compared with the corresponding cell line transfected with the scramble control. (a) SF3B1 mRNA expression measured 3 days after knockdown. (b ... Cell growth was inhibited in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown in comparison with the scramble control (Figure 1b). Cell cycle arrest in different phases was detected in different myeloid cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1c). K562 cells showed a significant G2M cell cycle arrest with a concomitant reduction in the percentage of cells in the G1 and S phase. TF1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase. HEL cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase and a significant increase in the sub-G1 cell population, indicating increased apoptosis. Similarly, SKM1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in S and G2M phase with a concomitant increase in the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 and G1 phase, indicating cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and an increase in apoptosis (Figure 1c).  Three cell lines (TF1, K562 and HEL) with SF3B1 knockdown were cultured with hemin to induce erythroid differentiation. We assessed the expression of the erythroid differentiation markers HBG1 and KLF1 using qRT-PCR. A significant reduction in the expression of HBG1 and KLF1 was observed in TF1 and K562 cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1d). In addition, we observed a reduction in the percentage of CD36+CD71+ and CD71+CD235a+ erythroid populations (significant for the CD36+CD71+ population) in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown compared with the scramble control (Figure 1e), suggesting that normal SF3B1 function is required for erythroid differentiation.17  RARS is characterized by FTMT accumulation and low expression levels of the iron transporter ABCB7.17, 29 We have previously shown that SF3B1 knockdown leads to decreased ABCB7 expression and increased FTMT expression in K562 cells.17 In this study, we have extended these observations to the other three myeloid cell lines investigated (Figure 2a). In addition, restoration of SF3B1 expression to normal levels after 10 days of culture was followed by restoration of ABCB7 expression levels to normal (Supplementary Figure S2).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown on gene expression and splicing. (a) ABCB7 and FTMT expression levels in TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1 cells with SF3B1 knockdown, as measured by qRT-PCR 48 h post transfection. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting ... Taken together, these data show that SF3B1 knockdown results in inhibition of cell growth, induction of cell cycle arrest and impairment of erythroid differentiation in myeloid cell lines.  SF3B1 knockdown alters gene expression  To evaluate the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on global gene expression, gene expression profiling was performed in the four myeloid cell lines. For each cell line, we compared the expression profiles of cells treated with two different siRNAs targeting SF3B1 with those of cells treated with a scramble control, 48 h post transfection.  We identified many genes that were up- or downregulated by >2-fold in each cell line treated with SF3B1 siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B). Four genes were upregulated (TFDP1, LOC100505759, MKRN1 and WRNIP1) and five genes were downregulated (ZC3H7A, CREBZF, SGK494, WSB1 and two probesets for SF3B1) in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  Pathway analysis was performed on the up- and downregulated genes in each cell line with SF3B1 knockdown using IPA. Significant deregulation of pathways related to cell cycle regulation was observed in all cell lines and of mTOR signaling and AMPK signaling pathways in three cell lines (Table 1). We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to identify pathways and processes showing coordinated up- or downregulation. Upregulated gene sets include p53 signaling in K562 and SKM1 cells, and several gene sets associated with regulation of transcription, spliceosome and splicing in K562 cells (Supplementary Table S4). Downregulated gene sets associated with the mitochondrial function were found in K562 and TF1 cells, and with cell cycle regulation in SKM1 and HEL cells (Supplementary Table S4). These data show that SF3B1 knockdown in the cell lines studied results in deregulation of many genes and pathways including cell cycle and RNA processing.  Table 1 Table 1 List of significant deregulated pathways in cell lines obtained using IPA SF3B1 knockdown impact on splicing  The genome-wide effects of SF3B1 knockdown on splicing were investigated in two myeloid cell lines (K562 and TF1) using human genome exon-junction arrays. The splicing profile of cells with SF3B1 knockdown (using two different siRNA per cell line) was compared with that of cells transfected with the scramble control.  We observed 2027 differentially expressed exons from 1419 genes, and 507 significant differentially regulated splicing variants (including exon skipping, intron retention and alternative splice sites) of 384 genes in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of CDC7 and SRSF11 in the data from both the cell lines, and of TP53 in TF1 cells. We found a significant overrepresentation of 3′ acceptor splice sites affected by alternative splicing events compared with 5′ donor splice sites (5:1 ratio, P=0.0027, χ2 test with Yates' correction), consistent with the known role of SF3B1 in the recognition of 3′ splice sites. Gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/), and many themes showed significant enrichment of genes affected at the level of exon usage and splice variants (Table 2). Cell cycle and RNA degradation were found to be consistently deregulated at both levels (Table 2). We investigated TP53 differential exon usage by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted bands. We observed exon skipping that was present in the SF3B1 knockdown cells only (Figure 2b).  Table 2 Table 2 Pathway analysis using human genome exon-junction array data at two different levels: differential exon usage and different splicing variant We also investigated whether two cell cycle genes (CCNA2 and STK6) previously shown to be aberrantly spliced in HeLa cells with SF3B1 knockdown,25 were also aberrantly spliced in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown in our study. Consistent with the finding in HeLa cells, we observed aberrant splicing of these genes using a qRT-PCR strategy as described previously (Figure 2c and d).25  RNA-Seq in HSPC from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations  To gain insight into the spectrum of genes that are deregulated or aberrantly spliced in association with SF3B1 mutation in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) of MDS patients, we used deep RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation (SF3B1 mutants), four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation (wild type) and five healthy controls (control) (Supplementary Table S3). Using IGV, we evaluated the expression of the SF3B1 alleles in SF3B1 mutant cases and observed a range of 45–52% of mutant allele frequency, indicating that both wild-type and mutant alleles were equally expressed (Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Figure S4).  We used edgeR to perform differential gene expression analysis of SF3B1 mutants versus wild type and control. At the whole transcript level, we observed a total of 526 genes (253 upregulated and 273 downregulated) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutants in comparison with wild type (Supplementary Table S5). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutants with control, we found 1823 significantly differentially expressed genes (646 upregulated and 1177 downregulated) (Supplementary Table S6). Genes linked to the pathogenesis of RARS and RCMD-RS, such as ALAS2 and ABCB7, were deregulated (ALAS2 upregulated and ABCB7 downregulated) in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. We also observed upregulation of the mitochondrial genes SLC25A37 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and GLRX5 in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control.  We performed an analysis using 121 genes either known to be expressed in erythroid cells30 or described as erythroid transcription factors in the literature. We found 42 differentially expressed genes (37 upregulated and 5 downregulated) when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control. These included heme biosynthetic enzymes (for example, ALAS2, ALAD, FECH and UROD), globin genes (for example, HBQ1, HBA2, HBB and HBA1) and transcription factors (for example, GATA1, GATA2 and KLF1). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we found a total of 32 differentially expressed genes (31 upregulated and 1 downregulated) of which 28 were overlapping with the differentially expressed genes found when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control.  We then performed pathway analysis on the significantly differentially expressed genes using IPA. Many pathways, including heme biosynthesis, mitotic roles of polo-like kinase and TNFR2 signaling, were significantly deregulated in the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type (Table 3). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with control, significantly deregulated pathways included apoptosis signaling, p53 signaling, cell cycle regulation and heme degradation (Supplementary Table S7). We next performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysisand many gene sets showing significant enrichment were identified in SF3B1 mutant versus wild type and control. Upregulated gene sets included several that were related to mitochondrial function, cell cycle checkpoints and mRNA splicing. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with control cases, downregulated gene sets included several that were related to cell differentiation and apoptosis (Supplementary Table S8). Many of these deregulated pathways and gene sets are relevant to the known pathophysiology of MDS and in particular of RARS and RCMD-RS.  Table 3 Table 3 Pathway analysis (IPA) of the significant differentially expressed genes between SF3B1 mutant and wild type obtained using edgeR DEXSeq was used to perform differential exon usage analysis of the RNAseq data to evaluate aberrantly spliced genes. At the exon level, we observed a total of 3506 exons (corresponding to 1924 genes) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (Table 4, Figure 3, Supplementary Table S9). Differential exon usage was observed in at least one exon of genes known to be involved in MDS pathophysiology (TP53 and EZH1), erythroid genes (ALAD, UROD and EPB42) and genes associated with cell cycle (AURKB and CRNDE) and RNA processing (RBM5, RBM25, PRPF40A and HNRNPD). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type cases, we found 3097 significantly differentially expressed exons (corresponding to 2022 genes) (Table 5, Figure 4, Supplementary Table S10). We found differential exon usage in at least one exon of genes involved in MDS pathophysiology (CBL, ASXL1 and DNMT3A), mitochondrial function (ALAS2, NDUFAF6), erythroid differentiation (NFE2L2, PPOX and HMBS) and mRNA processing (HNRNPD, U2AF2 and PRPF8). Interestingly, UQCC1, a gene involved in mitochondrial biogenesis31 and showing abnormal splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases in uveal melanoma,32 showed differential exon usage and upregulation in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with wild type and control in our study.

Table 4 Table 4 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and control, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq Table 5 Table 5 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and wild type, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq To identify pathways affected by differential exon usage, we performed pathway analysis on the genes showing significantly differentially expressed exons using IPA. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, we observed many pathways to be affected, including cell cycle, heme biosynthesis, DNA damage response, mitochondrial and haematopoietic progenitor cells pathway (Supplementary Table S11 and S12). Using DAVID functional annotation tool, we observed significant enrichment of biological themes including alternative splicing, RNA binding, mitochondrion, spliceosome and cell cycle.  Recently, a role for SF3B1 in the maintenance of genomic stability has also been reported where it functions in a DNA damage-induced mRNA splicing complex with BRCA1 and BCLAF1.33 Given that deregulation of the DNA damage response pathway was highlighted by the IPA pathway analysis, we performed an analysis using genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex. Several genes regulated by this complex showed differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (including NUMA1, RB1, CHUK and ABL1) and compared with wild type (NUMA1, PIAS1, SMAD4, BIRC2 and PTK2) (Supplementary Table S13). The overrepresentation of genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex was significant in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (P<0.001) and compared with wild type (P=0.0498, hypergeometric test). We also found many genes to be affected at the transcript level, including BIRC3, BCL2A1, GYPB, HBB and HBBP1 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control (Supplementary Table S13).  Go to: Discussion The identification of frequent somatic mutations of SF3B1 in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts suggests a direct correlation between the presence of mutations and this particular phenotype.2, 11, 13 However, the mechanism by which SF3B1 mutation leads to MDS with ring sideroblasts remains to be elucidated.  To illuminate the role of SF3B1 mutation in MDS pathophysiology, we have determined the effects of SF3B1 disruption on cell growth and gene expression in human hematological cells. First, we investigated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell function and gene expression in myeloid cell lines. Second, we used RNA-Seq to study the global gene expression changes and splicing abnormalities associated with the presence of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients.  We have shown that SF3B1 knockdown in four myeloid cell lines resulted in inhibition of cell growth and disruption of the cell cycle. It has recently been reported that Sf3b1+/− mice showed reduced numbers of HSC and compromised reconstitution capacity in lethally irradiated mice.14, 15 Thus, reduced expression of SF3B1 appears to result in impaired cell growth in hematopoietic cells. Similar observations have been made following reduced expression of other splicing factor genes, including U2AF1.3, 4, 34  We used two different microarray platforms to identify genes deregulated at the transcriptional and exon level by SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Gene expression profiling identified many deregulated genes, with four genes consistently upregulated, including TFDP1, and five genes downregulated, including CREBZF, in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown, several of which have a role in the control of cell growth. TFDP1 is involved in the control of transcriptional activity of G1/S cell cycle checkpoint genes,35 and CREBZF is a potent suppressor of cell growth, the effects of which are mediated through the tumor suppressor p53.36 Next, we employed exon-junction arrays to study the transcriptome in K562 and TF1 cells. We identified many differentially expressed exons and differentially regulated splicing variants in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of the CDC7 and SRSF11 genes, involved in cell cycle regulation and splicing, respectively, and of the TP53 gene. Several pathways including cell cycle, RNA processing, mitochondrion and apoptosis/p53 pathway were consistently deregulated in the cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  In summary, our data on myeloid cell lines suggest that the phenotype observed in cells with SF3B1 knockdown is mediated by aberrant splicing and expression of target genes involved in key biological processes.  RNA-Seq is the method of choice for a comprehensive analysis of global gene expression and splicing. In all relevant studies published to date, RNA-Seq has been performed on unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells from a small number of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations (n⩽3 per study), revealing interesting data.11, 37, 38 MDS arise in the HSC, and it is thus of critical importance that the effects of SF3B1 mutation on the transcriptome are studied in the cell of origin. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq on purified bone marrow CD34+ cells from 12 MDS patients, eight with ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutation and four without mutation in other splicing factor genes, and from five healthy controls.  We identified many significantly differentially expressed genes at the transcript level and the exon level when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. CD34+ cells from RCMD-RS and RARS patients display a particular expression profile of mitochondria-related genes;17, 20 we observed upregulation of ALAS2 (heme biosynthesis enzyme) and downregulation of ABCB7 (involved in the transport of iron from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm) in SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control, in agreement with our previous reports.17, 20 SLC25A37, encoding a mitochondrial iron importer, and GLRX5, encoding another mitochondrial protein, were both significantly upregulated in CD34+ cells of SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control. A recent study showed SLC25A37 mRNA upregulation in SF3B1 mutant bone marrow mononuclear cells of three MDS patients with RARS/-T.38 Evidence is thus mounting to suggest that upregulation of the iron importer SLC25A37 and downregulation of iron exporter ABCB7 may be linked to the increased mitochondrial iron accumulation observed in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts.39 Deregulation of these genes could also be consistent with an impaired ability of mitochondrial pathways to use iron that may result in an attempt to increase iron availability.  Importantly, we observed many genes associated with porphyrin and heme biosynthesis showing differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant cases, indicating altered splicing. These include ALAD and UROD when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and ALAS2 and PPOX when comparing with wild type. We suggest that the aberrant expression and exon usage of mitochondrial and heme-related genes in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation has a role in ring sideroblast formation and abnormal iron homeostasis observed in this patient group. Intriguingly, the most common congenital sideroblastic anemia (X-linked sideroblastic anemia) results from an ALAS2 mutation.40  The relative expression levels of the transcription factors GATA1 and GATA2 differed from normal in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation. The dynamic and strictly regulated change of expression from GATA2 to GATA1 during erythropoiesis has a crucial role,41 and any alteration of this pattern may be predicted to lead to aberrant erythropoiesis. We suggest that the aberrant expression and splicing of erythroid-related genes observed in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation may have a role in the ineffective erythropoiesis found in these patients.  In a previous study, RNA-Seq was used to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow mononuclear cells of two MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation to that of one healthy control.11 One hundred and thirty genes showed significant differential expression, 28 of which overlap with the genes differentially expressed between SF3B1 mutant and control in our study of CD34+ cells. These genes include MAP3K8 and CLEC5A, which have been previously shown to be downregulated in MDS.19, 42 Furthermore, 350 genes showed differential exon usage, and 52 of these were in common with the genes showing differential exon usage in our study of CD34+ cells. The overlapping genes include EZH1, ASXL1, CBL1 and SMAD4.  The mutant forms of ASXL1, CBL and TP53 are known to have an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of MDS, and intriguingly all these genes were found to be alternatively spliced in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  A recent study identified a DNA damage-induced BRCA1 protein complex containing BCLAF1 and SF3B1 (BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex).33 In response to DNA damage, the complex regulates pre-mRNA splicing of genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair and hence affects their transcription and pre-mRNA maturation.33 Importantly, we found many of the genes regulated by this complex to be differentially expressed and to show differential exon usage in our study. Genes showing differential transcript level changes included BIRC3 and BCL2A1, whereas NUMA1 showed differential exon usage when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we also found differential exon usage of the PIAS1 gene, a DNA damage response regulator.43, 44 It has been demonstrated that abrogation of members of this complex including BRCA1 and BCLAF1 results in genomic instability,33 a common feature of malignant cells. In MDS patients with mutant SF3B1, the function of this complex may be impaired, with possible downstream effects on the efficiency of DNA damage repair.  Many genes involved in RNA splicing and processing were found to show differential transcript levels, as well as differential exon usage in our study, including HNRNPD, U2AF2, PRPF8 and RBM25. A recent study showed RNA processing genes to be misspliced in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of MDS/AML patients with U2AF1 mutation.45 Intriguingly, there is limited overlap between the genes misspliced as a result of U2AF1 mutation and the RNA processing/splicing genes deregulated/aberrantly spliced in our SF3B1 mutant cases in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, suggesting that this process may be affected by different splicing mutations even if their target genes are distinct.  A recent study showed that defects in the splicing factor gene PRPF8 result in missplicing in myeloid malignancies and are associated with the presence of ring sideroblasts in advanced MDS and AML.46 Interestingly, we observed differential exon usage of PRPF8 in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with control in our study, indicating a link between SF3B1 and PRPF8 and the ring sideroblast phenotype. Our finding of differential exon usage of multiple RNA processing/splicing genes in the HSPC of cases with SF3B1 mutation points towards an exacerbation of aberrant splicing, with a wider number of downstream target genes affected. Emerging evidence from our study on SF3B1 and the study on U2AF145 thus supports the hypothesis that in MDS patients harboring splicing factor mutations, there is widespread disruption of the splicing machinery as a consequence of downstream effects of the mutant protein. Loss-of-function mutations in zebrafish Prpf8 have been shown to result in missplicing of TP53.47 We found TP53 to be aberrantly spliced in MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation compared with wild type and control.  Splicing factor mutations, including SF3B1, are considered to be founder mutations and must confer a selective growth advantage to the HSC, but how this occurs remains a mystery. We have identified differential splicing in several genes known to have a role in MDS pathogenesis, including TP53 and ASXL1, as well as genes involved in DNA damage repair, in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations. We suggest that the aberrant splicing of such genes may confer oncogenic properties that help drive the malignant process. In this study, we have determined the target genes of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients with ring sideroblasts, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying this phenotype.  Precursor mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a macromolecule composed of small nuclear RNAs associated with proteins. The SF3B1 gene encodes subunit 1 of the splicing factor 3b, which is important for anchoring the spliceosome to precursor mRNA. In 2011, whole-exome sequencing studies showed recurrent somatic mutations of SF3B1 and other genes of the RNA splicing machinery in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm. SF3B1 mutations had a particularly high frequency among conditions characterized by ring sideroblasts, which is consistent with a causal relationship. SF3B1 mutants were also detected at a lower frequency in a variety of other tumor types. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, SF3B1 was found to be the second most frequently mutated gene. In myelodysplastic syndromes, SF3B1 mutations appear to be founding genetic lesions and are associated with a low risk of leukemic evolution. In contrast, SF3B1 mutations have a lower incidence in early stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are more common in advanced disease, and tend to be associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that they occur during clonal evolution of the disease. The assessment of SF3B1 mutation status may become innovative diagnostic and prognostic tools and the availability of spliceosome modulators opens novel therapeutic prospects.  Go to: Introduction Until recently, the molecular basis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has remained essentially elusive. In the last few years, however, there have been major advances in this field and it has become apparent that somatic mutations of genes encoding core components of the RNA splicing machinery play a major role in the pathophysiology of MDS and other hematologic malignancies.1–4 In this perspective article, we examine the biologic and clinical significance of mutations in SF3B1, a gene that encodes subunit 1 of the splicing factor 3b protein complex, in myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms.  Go to: Basic concepts of RNA splicing Most eukaryotic genes have coding sequences (exon) and noncoding (intron) sequences and are initially expressed as precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) that includes all of these sequences (Figure 1).5 The term mRNA splicing or maturation defines the process by which introns are excised from pre-mRNA and flanking exons are ligated together.5 In higher eukaryotes, most genes undergo different patterns of splicing, generating alternative mRNA isoforms that have different functions and contribute to biologic complexity.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Schematic representation of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing. Top: Human genes have coding (exon) and noncoding (intron) sequences and are initially expressed as pre-mRNA that includes all of these sequences. In the process of precursor mRNA splicing ... Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a macromolecule composed of 5 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) associated with proteins to form particles termed small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs; Figure 1).6,7 In most eukaryotes, including humans, there are 2 classes of introns: the common U2 type, representing more than 99% of human introns, and the rare U12 type, with the 2 differing in their consensus splice-site sequences. The removal of these 2 types of introns is catalyzed by 2 different spliceosomes called the U2- and U12-dependent spliceosomes, respectively. The 2 spliceosomes differ in their snRNA composition (Figure 1) but share most of the proteins.  The assembly of the spliceosome occurs anew on each pre-mRNA, which contains specific sequences that drive and regulate this process. The crucial signal sequences are the splice donor site (5′ end), the branch site (near the 3′ end), and the splice acceptor site (3′ end of the intron; Figure 1). In the major U2-dependent spliceosome, the donor site is recognized by the U1 snRNP, whereas the branch site is recognized by the U2 snRNP.  Several proteins interact with snRNAs to form snRNPs within the spliceosome.5 Those interacting with U1 and U2 snRNAs in the early phase of intron recognition and spliceosome formation include SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, U2AF65, SF1, SF3B1, SF3A1, and PRPF40B (Table 1).6 The SF3B1 protein is a core component of the U2 snRNP, which binds to the branch site, thereby base-pairing with the intron RNA.6  Table 1 Table 1 Genes encoding proteins that are core components of U1 and U2 snRNPs of the spliceosome, and their mutation status in human malignancies Although transcription of nucleosome-free DNA into pre-mRNA by RNA polymerase II and pre-mRNA splicing are traditionally considered as separate and sequential processes, increasing evidence suggests that transcription and RNA processing are strictly coupled in vivo and that several splicing factors also play a role in the regulation of transcription.8 For an in-depth analysis of this topic, the reader is referred to a recent review by Han et al.9 The concept of cotranscriptional splicing is represented schematically in Figure 2.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Schematic representation of the concept of cotranscriptional RNA splicing and potential outcomes of mutations of genes encoding proteins of the spliceosome. Top: Although transcription of nucleosome-free DNA into pre-mRNA by RNA polymerase II and pre-mRNA ... Go to: Abnormalities of mRNA splicing and human disease Abnormal mRNA splicing may result from mutations of splice-site sequences, mutations in splicing regulatory sequences, and mutations in genes of the splicing machinery itself (ie, spliceosome mutations).  Mutations of the splice-site sequences or splicing regulatory sequences are responsible for a large fraction of human inherited diseases.6,10 For example, β-thalassemia may derive from mutations in splice-site sequences of the HBB gene that cause abnormal splicing of HBB and defective synthesis of its protein, β-globin.11 Conversely, inherited disorders caused by spliceosome mutations (ie, mutations of genes encoding spliceosomal proteins or mutations in spliceosomal RNA) are rare, at least based on our current understanding. For detailed information, the reader is referred to a recent comprehensive review article by Padgett.6  Somatic mutations of spliceosome genes were unknown until recently. From a theoretical point of view, they disrupt several processes downstream, because an altered spliceosome may cause abnormal transcription and altered splicing outcomes of thousands of genes. These outcomes include reduced (or also increased) transcription, exon skipping, intron retention, and cryptic splice site activation with truncated (or elongated) exon (Figure 2). It is now becoming apparent that through these mechanisms, somatic mutations of the RNA splicing machinery can play a role in the pathogenesis of human cancers, in particular in the pathophysiology of hematologic malignancies.  Go to: SF3B1 mutations in myeloid neoplasms The first identification of a somatic mutation of SF3B1 was done at the end of 2010 by investigators of the Chronic Myeloid Disorders Working Group (CMD-WG) of the International Cancer Genome Consortium. When this collaboration was established in the first months of 2010, it was decided to perform whole-exome sequencing studies in patients with MDS, and more specifically in those with myelodysplasia with ring sideroblasts.  MDS are clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by peripheral cytopenia and propensity to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML).12,13 These disorders show impressive clinical heterogeneity, ranging from conditions with a near-normal standardized mortality ratio to entities that are very close to AML.14–16 Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) is a phenotypically well-defined subtype of MDS characterized by erythroblasts with iron-loaded mitochondria, which are visualized by Prussian blue staining (Perls reaction) as a perinuclear ring of blue granules. Ring sideroblasts are also the morphologic hallmark of congenital sideroblastic anemias, inherited disorders because of germline mutations of genes such ALAS2 (X-linked sideroblastic anemia, OMIM #300751), ABCB7 (sideroblastic anemia and spinocerebellar ataxia, OMIM #301310), and SLC25A38 (autosomal recessive pyridoxine-refractory sideroblastic anemia, OMIM #205950).17–20 In patients with RARS, the iron deposited in perinuclear mitochondria of ring sideroblasts is present in the form of mitochondrial ferritin, which is encoded by the FTMT gene and is undetectable in normal erythropoiesis.21,22 In addition, both CD34-positive cells and immature RBCs from RARS patients are characterized by reduced expression of ABCB7,23,24 a gene that encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter involved in the regulation of mitochondrial iron homeostasis.25  The CMD-WG investigators reasoned that the peculiar phenotype of RARS could make easier the identification of recurrently mutated genes and used massively parallel sequencing technology to this purpose. Using this approach, Papaemmanuil et al identified 62 point mutations with a predominance of transitions across 8 RARS patients.2 Very interestingly, 6 of the 8 subjects studied had somatic mutations in SF3B1.  To characterize the spectrum and frequency of SF3B1 mutations, the CMD-WG investigators undertook targeted resequencing of the gene in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.14,26 Somatic mutations of SF3B1 were found in approximately 30% of patients with MDS and in 20% of patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN). SF3B1 was also mutated in smaller proportions of patients with other tumor types. All mutations appeared to be heterozygous substitutions clustered in exons 12-16 of the gene. The K700E mutation accounted for more than 50% of the variants observed, and additional codons (666, 662, 622, and 625) were found to be hot spots for mutation. Results of quantitative evaluation of SF3B1 mutant allele burden were consistent with the presence of a dominant clone with heterozygous SF3B1 mutation in most of the cases and with the existence of a minority mutant clone in a smaller fraction of patients.26  Additional investigations performed by Papaemmanuil et al demonstrated that SF3B1 mutations were less deleterious than expected by chance, implying that the mutated protein retains structural integrity with altered function.2 Furthermore, gene-expression profiling revealed that SF3B1 mutations were associated with down-regulation of key gene networks, including core mitochondrial pathways.2  In the same period that the CMD-WG investigators were conducting whole-exome studies in myelodysplasia with ring sideroblasts, Yoshida et al performed whole-exome sequencing of paired tumor/control DNA from patients with various subtypes of MDS.1 Again, this study unexpectedly revealed novel pathway mutations involving multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery, including U2AF1, ZRSR2, SRSF2, and SF3B1. Targeted analysis in a larger patient population showed that RNA splicing mutations were frequent in patients with MDS and MDS/MPN. More specifically, somatic mutations of SF3B1 were found in 75% of patient with ring sideroblasts, whereas mutations of U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SRSF2 were more common in myeloid disorders without ring sideroblasts. In particular, approximately one-third of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia had somatic mutations of SRSF2.  Go to: Relationship between SF3B1 mutations and ring sideroblasts in myeloid neoplasms In patients with MDS or MDS/MPN, we found a close relationship between ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutations.26 In fact, the SF3B1 mutation status had a positive predictive value for disease phenotype with ring sideroblasts of 97.7% (95% confidence interval, 93.5%-99.5%), whereas the absence of ring sideroblasts had a negative predictive value for SF3B1 mutation of 97.8% (95% confidence interval, 93.8%-99.5%).  The close relationship between SF3B1 mutations and ring sideroblasts in myeloid neoplasms has been confirmed in all subsequent studies.27–32 This is consistent with a causal relationship and makes SF3B1 the first gene to be strongly associated with a specific morphologic feature in myeloid neoplasms.  The molecular mechanisms underlying iron accumulation in the mitochondria of immature RBCs from patients with RARS are currently being investigated. One potential mechanism of ring sideroblast formation might be the reduced expression of the gene ABCB7, which is essential for hematopoiesis33 and mitochondrial iron homeostasis25 and is mutated in the congenital sideroblastic anemia associated with spinocerebellar ataxia.18 Overall, ABCB7 protein deficiency results in mitochondrial iron overload, reduced heme synthesis in immature RBCs, and ineffective erythropoiesis.25 In hematopoietic progenitors and precursors from RARS patients, low levels of ABCB7 expression are typically associated with high levels of FTMT expression.21,34,35 Overexpression of mitochondrial ferritin in RARS erythroblasts occurs at a very early stage of erythroid differentiation,34 suggesting that it might be a cause rather than a consequence of mitochondrial iron overload. A recent study by Nikpour et al has tested the hypothesis that a reduced expression of ABCB7 plays a role in the pathophysiology of RARS.36 The investigators showed that down-regulation of ABCB7 led to markedly reduced erythroid growth in vitro with accumulation of mitochondrial ferritin in immature RBCs. In addition, normalization of ABCB7 expression in RARS erythroblasts rescued aspects of the RARS phenotype. Finally, an altered ABCB7 exon usage was found in primary cells from patients with SF3B1-mutated RARS. These findings suggest that reduced transcription and abnormal splicing of ABCB7 in patients carrying a somatic mutation of SF3B1 may be at least one of the mechanisms that lead to ring sideroblast formation and RARS phenotype, as represented schematically in Figure 3.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Schematic representation of our current understanding of the relationship between the occurrence of a somatic SF3B1 mutation and the formation of ring sideroblasts in patients with RARS. Previous studies found reduced expression of ABCB7 in CD34-positive ... In a study aimed at defining the relationship between dysfunction in SF3B1 and formation of ring sideroblasts, Visconte et al37 found that meayamycin, a pharmacologic inhibitor of the splicing factor 3b complex,38 induced the formation of ring sideroblasts in healthy BM cells in vitro. They were also able to detect ring sideroblasts by Perls staining in Sf3b1 heterozygous-knockout mice and therefore concluded that SF3B1 haploinsufficiency leads to ring sideroblast formation.  Although the majority of SF3B1-mutated RARS patients have a fully dominant clone that is heterozygous for the mutation, their percentage of ring sideroblasts ranges considerably from less than 20% to more than 90%. Although we found a significant relationship between this percentage and SF3B1 mutant allele burden,26 this does not fully explain the above variability, suggesting that additional factors play a role in the RARS phenotypic expression.  In all of the studies published so far, approximately 10%-20% of RARS patients have no evidence of mutations in SF3B1. This may partly reflect inaccuracies in the diagnosis of RARS related to difficulties in the identification of ring sideroblasts.39 However, the possibility exists that other mutant genes of RNA splicing machinery may lead to ring sideroblast formation.1  Go to: Prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations in MDS The close relationship between ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutations in MDS would in principle imply that the mutant gene be associated with a mild clinical course. In fact, RARS is mainly characterized by erythroid dysplasia and ineffective erythropoiesis, and in most patients its clinical course is stable for years with a low risk of leukemic evolution.40–42 In our study on prognostic factors in MDS,15 the life expectancy of RARS patients 70 years or older was not significantly different from that of the general reference population.  The studies published so far on the prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations in MDS have provided conflicting results, as detailed in Table 2. Before examining this issue, we want to emphasize that, for a proper evaluation of the prognostic relevance of any somatic mutation in MDS patients, ad hoc analyses should account for left censoring of the observations at the time of mutation assessment and for right censoring of the observations at the time of any potentially disease-modifying treatment. The striking enrichment of SF3B1 mutation in patients with RARS and its low frequency in patients with excess of blasts would a priori imply that in a population of MDS patients, those carrying a mutant SF3B1 had a better clinical outcome than those with a wild-type gene. This observation has indeed been made by us (Figure 4)26 and others.28 In contrast, 2 studies did not find any significant effect of the mutation on clinical outcome29,30; apparently, these studies did not account for right censoring of the observations at the time of any potentially disease-modifying treatment. In another study including only MDS patients with ring sideroblasts, the presence of SF3B1 mutations was associated with better overall and leukemia-free survival in univariate analysis.27 However, this prognostic value was lost in multivariable analysis including World Health Organization (WHO) morphologic category.27 This was the case also in our study,26 mainly because of the strict collinearity between ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutations. Lastly, in a study on MDS patients with lower-risk disease, mutations of SF3B1 showed only a trend toward longer survival.31  Table 2 Table 2 Recent studies on the prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations in patients with MDS Figure 4 Figure 4 Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival in MDS patients stratified according to SF3B1 mutation status. (A) Overall survival, defined here as the time (in months) between the date of diagnosis and the date of death (for patients who deceased) or last follow-up ... In our study,26 SF3B1 mutation remained an independent predictor of better survival even after adjustment for the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk, whereas its significance was borderline after adjustment for the WHO classification–based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) risk. In a multivariate analysis including WHO categories, when stratifying MDS patients according to unilineage dysplasia, multilineage dysplasia, and excess of blasts, SF3B1 mutation remained an independent predictor of better clinical outcome (M.C., L.M., unpublished observations, October 2012). This effect was lost when stratification included also a “ring sideroblast” category, again because of the strict collinearity between SF3B1 mutation and ring sideroblasts.  Clearly, the positive prognostic value of SF3B1 mutation may be partly or completely lost after acquisition of other somatic mutations, in particular those associated with disease progression. This might be the case, for example, if a patient with SF3B1-mutated RARS acquires an ASXL1 mutation and progresses to a condition characterized by multilineage dysplasia or excess of blasts in addition to ring sideroblasts. Alternatively, an SF3B1 mutation may mitigate the negative impact of other concomitant molecular lesions. A recent study has shown that DNMT3A and SF3B1 mutations commonly cooccur, suggesting a possible biologic cooperativity between the 2 molecular lesions.31 In that study, SF3B1 mutations had a trend toward longer survival and patients with concomitant DNMT3A and SF3B1mutations had a longer median survival than patients with DNMT3A mutations alone. This observation underlines the importance of simultaneously evaluating the mutation status of several genes of potential clinical relevance in the molecular prognostication of any myeloid neoplasm, a concept clearly illustrated also by a recent study in AML patients.43  Go to: SF3B1 mutations in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis RARS associated with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T) is a MDS/MPN characterized by refractory anemia associated with erythroid dysplasia and ringed sideroblasts, platelet count 450 × 109/L or greater, and the presence of large atypical megakaryocytes similar to those observed in BCR/ABL1-negative MPN.44  The majority of patients with RARS-T carry a somatic mutation of SF3B1,26,28 and approximately 50% of them have a somatic mutation of JAK2 or MPL.44–46 A recent analysis of 47 patients with RARS-T strictly matching the 2008 WHO criteria showed that 41 of 47 (87%) subjects carried an SF3B1 mutation, 36 (77%) had JAK2 (V617F), and 30 (64%) had concomitant mutations in SF3B1 and JAK2.32 This reinforces the opinion that RARS-T is a true MDS/MPN at both the clinical and the molecular levels,44 and should no longer be considered a provisional entity in the WHO classification. A recent European collaborative study has shown that patients with RARS-T have better overall survival than those with RARS and shorter overall survival than those with essential thrombocythemia,46 underlying the clinical relevance of interactions between different mutant genes.  We demonstrated previously that RARS-T may develop from RARS through the acquisition of somatic mutations of JAK2, MPL, or other, as-yet-unknown genes.45 In keeping with previous observations, the assessment of the mutant allele burden in RARS-T patients carrying concomitant mutations of SF3B1 and JAK2 showed higher values for SF3B1 mutants compared with JAK2 mutants.26 These considerations suggest that, in a portion of patients, RARS-T may develop through sequential acquisition of SF3B1 and JAK2 mutations, as represented schematically in Figure 5.44 It has been suggested that RARS-T might also develop from a JAK2 (V617F)–mutated MPN through the acquisition of an SF3B1 mutation.32 This is theoretically possible, but less likely than the transition reported in Figure 5, because it would imply that a JAK2 (V617F)–mutated/SF3B1-mutated subclone has a competitive advantage over a JAK2 (V617F)–mutated dominant clone. It should be noted that SF3B1 mutations have not been detected so far in patients with polycythemia vera,2 whereas they have been identified in only 3% of those with essential thrombocythemia2 and in 7% of those with primary myelofibrosis.47  Figure 5 Figure 5 Schematic representation of the multistep molecular pathogenesis of RARS-T through sequential acquisition of SF3B1 and JAK2 or MPL mutations. The occurrence of a somatic mutation of SF3B1 causes mitochondrial iron overload, ineffective erythropoiesis, ... Go to: SF3B1 mutations in CLL Our understanding of the genetics of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has advanced significantly in recent years and the biology of CLL is currently used to choose treatment.48 However, the most striking advances regarding mutant genes have been made possible in the last 2 years by the use of next-generation sequencing technology.  In a comprehensive analysis of CLL combining whole-genome sequencing in 4 cases with targeted resequencing in 363 patients, Puente et al identified 4 genes that were recurrently mutated in CLL patients (NOTCH1, XPO1, MYD88, and KLHL6).49 Wang et al used a similar strategy and analyzed DNA samples from 91 CLL patients (88 exomes and 3 genomes).3 They identified 9 genes that were recurrently mutated: 4 (TP53, ATM, MYD88, and NOTCH1) were already known for their established role in CLL, whereas the remaining 5 genes (SF3B1, FBXW7, ZMYM3, DDX3X, and MAPK1) had not been previously associated with CLL.  In the study by Wang et al, somatic mutations of SF3B1 were found in approximately 15% of patients, making this the second most frequently mutated gene in CLL, and were highly enriched in patients with del(11q).3 Considering that the ATM gene maps on chromosome 11q22-q23, and that 2 patients had point mutations in both ATM and SF3B1 but did not have del(11q), the above enrichment suggests that SF3B1 mutations may be synergistic with loss of ATM. Using an ad hoc assay, Wang et al found alterations in pre-mRNA splicing in tumor samples from CLL patients carrying a somatic mutation of SF3B1.3 With respect to clinical implications, they concluded that SF3B1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis in CLL, because a Cox multivariate regression model revealed that an SF3B1 mutation was predictive of an earlier need for treatment independently of other established predictive factors. This analysis had limitations, mainly because of lack of information on the timing of acquisition of the SF3B1 mutation.50  While investigating the coding genome of fludarabine-refractory CLL, Rossi et al found recurrent mutations of SF3B1, and therefore did targeted resequencing of the gene in 3 different patient cohorts.51 The incidence of SF3B1 mutation was 17% in fludarabine-refractory patients, 5% in newly diagnosed patients, and 6% in patients with Richter syndrome. Serial samples of mutated patients were available in 3 cases and the SF3B1 mutation was found to be acquired during follow-up in 2 of these. SF3B1 mutations were absent among mature B-cell neoplasms other than CLL, and in a separate study,52 a mutant SF3B1 was detected in only one of 63 subjects with clinical monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, a condition that might represent the initial phases of CLL.53  Quesada et al studied 279 untreated patients with CLL and found SF3B1 mutations in 27 (10%).54 As in previous studies, the most frequent mutation was K700E, occurring in almost half of the cases, followed by G742D, a mutation rarely found in myeloid neoplasms. No SF3B1 mutation was detected in 156 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.54 CLL patients with mutations in SF3B1 had more aggressive disease and shorter overall survival than patients without these mutations. The fact that these patients were untreated suggests that SF3B1 mutations may occur during disease development without necessarily being a result of chemotherapy-induced selective pressure.55  Several groups are currently evaluating the clinical significance of SF3B1 mutations in CLL patients. Oscier et al have recently assessed the effect of NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations in a cohort of 494 newly diagnosed CLL patients enrolled in the randomized phase 3 CLL4 trial comparing chlorambucil with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide or fludarabine alone.56 NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations were found in 10% and 17% of untreated CLL patients and were independently associated with shorter survival in multivariate analysis. SF3B1 mutations were enriched in CD38-positive patients. In that study, TP53 abnormalities remained the most important negative prognostic factor, as was found previously in the German CLL Study Group CLL4 trial.57  The available evidence indicates that SF3B1 mutations are specific for CLL among mature B-cell neoplasms, have a lower incidence in early stages of CLL, occur more commonly in advanced disease, and tend to be associated with poor prognosis. Ongoing analyses from the German CLL Study Group will likely provide additional information.  Go to: SF3B1 mutation, clonal dominance, and disease progression in hematologic malignancies Most patients with RARS carrying an SF3B1 mutation have a mutant allele burden between 40% and 50% in both circulating granulocytes and BM CD34-positive cells,26 indicating that the mutation occurs in a hematopoietic progenitor, determines expansion and dominance of a heterozygous clone, and is then transmitted to its myeloid progeny.  The mechanisms by which a mutant SF3B1 protein determines clonal proliferation of a CD34-positive cell have not yet been elucidated. As shown in Figure 2, a spliceosome mutation may cause abnormal transcription and various types of abnormal splicing or alternative splicing events. The fundamental problem is that the spliceosome controls the expression of thousands of genes and it is therefore difficult to identify those that are relevant for clonal expansion of a hematopoietic cell. The current debate as to whether an SF3B1 mutation is a gain-of-function or a loss-of-function mutation is partly meaningless. Because the mutant SF3B1 protein alters transcription and splicing of several genes, deciphering gains and losses is extremely difficult. In addition, even assuming that an SF3B1 mutation can cause clonal expansion and dominance of hematopoietic progenitors, it remains to be explained how the same mutation results in defective maturation of immature RBCs leading to ineffective erythropoiesis. One interpretation is that the abnormal mitochondrial iron homeostasis (Figure 3) results in excessive apoptosis of erythroid cells.  The effects of SF3B1 mutations may also be unrelated to the splicing activity of the protein. In fact, Sf3b1 heterozygous knockout mice have skeletal abnormalities associated with ectopic Hox gene expression.58 This is independent of the alteration of general gene expression and derives from an abnormal interaction with the polycomb group proteins that are responsible for the stable repression of Hox genes.  With respect to CLL, the available evidence indicates that SF3B1 mutations are very unlikely to be founding mutations in this lymphoid neoplasm. More likely, they occur during the clonal progression of the disease and determine the emergence of more aggressive subclones.  Ebert and Bernard4 have proposed the provocative hypothesis that SF3B1 mutations might occur initially in multipotent hematopoietic stem cells and that additional somatic mutations may determine the disease phenotype. In the case of RARS, the SF3B1 mutation must occur in a hematopoietic cell capable of myeloid differentiation26 and can cause a myelodysplastic phenotype without the need of additional mutations.2 With respect to CLL, the SF3B1 mutation is unlikely to be an initiating event. Nonetheless, the notion that myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms can share mutant genes is potentially interesting, as shown by a study on TET2 mutations in malignant lymphomas.59 This is at least consistent that the concept that the same mutation can cause 2 completely different diseases depending on the cell type in which it occurs.  Go to: Potential implications of SF3B1 mutations for molecular diagnosis and prognosis of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms Molecular tools are increasingly being used in the diagnosis and prognostic definition of both myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. The implications of SF3B1 mutations based on the findings of studies published so far are summarized in Table 3.  Table 3 Table 3 Potential implications of somatic mutations of SF3B1 for molecular diagnosis and prognostication of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms The 2008 WHO diagnostic criteria for MDS are essentially based on morphology (erythroid dysplasia, ring sideroblasts, multilineage dysplasia, and excess of blasts), and include cytogenetics with respect to MDS with del(5q). At present, the most important prognostic factors in MDS are WHO category, cytogenetic abnormality, and transfusion requirement or severity of anemia, all of which are included in the WPSS.16 The degree of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have additional prognostic significance, as shown by the recent study on the revised IPSS (IPSS-R) for MDS.60 Nevertheless, there is a need for more reliable diagnostic and prognostic tools.  The elegant study by Bejar et al has illustrated the clinical effect of point mutations in MDS, in particular the potential of molecular data for facilitating diagnosis, improving prognostication, and allowing the evaluation of disease progression.61 In the next years, targeted gene sequencing is likely to become a frontline diagnostic and prognostic test for MDS, and mutation analysis of SF3B1 should be part of this approach, as suggested in Table 3.  Within MDS/MPN, future diagnostic criteria of RARS-T might include a combination of anemia and thrombocytosis as clinical parameters and a combination of SF3B1 and JAK2 or MPL mutations as molecular parameters.  Finally, several studies are currently being conducted to define the prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations in CLL.  Go to: Spliceosome as a target for therapy Several compounds can modulate mRNA splicing, and a recent review article by Webb et al examines this topic comprehensively.62 Natural products include spliceostatin A,63 pladienolide,64 and meayamycin,38 and small synthetic molecule modulators of splicing factor 3b include sudemycins.65  Spliceosome modulators have antitumor activity in cellular and animal models, and the available evidence indicates that interaction with splicing factor 3b is crucial for their cytotoxic activity.62,64 These compounds likely alter the interaction between splicing factor 3b and pre-mRNA66 and induce abnormal transcription and alternative splicing in mammalian cells.  In the case of hematologic malignancies associated with SF3B1 mutations, the mutant splicing factor 3b causes abnormal transcription and alternative splicing per se. The effect of the above compounds on an abnormal splicing factor is currently unpredictable and preclinical studies are therefore needed to explore the effect of molecule modulators of splicing factor 3b in SF3B1-mutated myeloid or lymphoid cells. The working hypothesis is that cells harboring a spliceosome mutation may be more sensitive to spliceosome modulators.  More than 80% of patients with the refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have mutations in Splicing Factor 3B, Subunit 1 (SF3B1). We generated a conditional knockin mouse model of the most common SF3B1 mutation, Sf3b1K700E. Sf3b1K700E mice develop macrocytic anemia due to a terminal erythroid maturation defect, erythroid dysplasia, and long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) expansion. Sf3b1K700E myeloid progenitors and SF3B1-mutant MDS patient samples demonstrate aberrant 30 splice-site selection associated with increased nonsense-mediated decay. Tet2 loss cooperates with Sf3b1K700E to cause a more severe erythroid and LT-HSC phenotype. Furthermore, the spliceosome modulator, E7017, selectively kills SF3B1K700E-expressing cells. Thus, SF3B1K700E expression reflects the phenotype of the mutation in MDS and may be a therapeutic target in MDS. INTRODUCTION Recurrent point mutations in components of the 30 mRNA splicing machinery are the most common mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (Papaemmanuil et al., 2011; Visconte et al., 2012a; Welch et al., 2012; Yoshida et al., 2011). MDS is characterized by clonal hematopoiesis, peripheral blood cytopenias, and a variable risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Splicing factor gene mutations in MDS are typically heterozygous, missense, and mutually exclusive of one another. The three most commonly mutated splicing factors in MDS, SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2, are all involved in the initial steps of spliceosome assembly (Kramer, 1996; Will and Luhrmann, 2011; Yoshida et al., 2011). Significance Somatic point mutations in components of the pre-mRNA spliceosome are the most common mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Here we demonstrate that mutation of the most commonly mutated splicing factor in MDS, Sf3b1, causes impaired red blood cell differentiation leading to anemia, an increase in long-term hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, and myelodysplasia. We also show that mutant SF3B1 causes increased aberrant 30 splice-site selection leading to increased nonsense-mediated decay. Sf3b1 mutations cooperate with Tet2 loss to cause an accelerated MDS phenotype. Cells expressing mutant SF3B1 have increased sensitivity to the spliceosome modulator, E7107. These data show how mutant SF3B1 affects hematopoiesis and mRNA splicing and identify spliceosome inhibitors as a potential new therapy for MDS. 404 Cancer Cell 30, 404–417, September 12, 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc. The spliceosome is a large macromolecular complex composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and more than 200 additional proteins (Chen and Manley, 2009). More than 90% of human genes undergo alternative splicing of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA), a tightly regulated process that dramatically increases the complexity of the protein repertoire encoded by the genome (Becerra et al., 2015). The 50 splice site (ss) of an intron is typically defined by a GU dinucleotide. Three sequence elements define the 30 ss: an AG dinucleotide at the 30 end of the intron, a variable length of pyrimidine nucleotides within the intron called the polypyrimidine tract, and a branch-point sequence upstream of the polypyrimidine tract that generally contains a conserved adenosine. Recognition of these sequences by different components of the spliceosome machinery is required for the initial step of pre-mRNA splicing (Will and Luhrmann, 2011). SF3B1 encodes subunit 1 of the splicing factor 3b (SF3b) protein complex. Together with the SF3a protein complex and a 12S rRNA, SF3b forms the U2 snRNP (Kramer, 1996). Base pairing between the U2 snRNP and the branch-point sequence is essential for pre-mRNA splicing (Gozani et al., 1998). The SF3b/SF3a complex anchors the U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA (Gozani et al., 1996), and SF3B1 is a critical component of the activated spliceosome that helps position the branch-point adenosine for nucleophilic attack from the 50 ss (Gozani et al., 1998). SF3B1 point mutations observed in MDS are confined to exons 14 through 16. The most common SF3B1 mutation is an A-to-G transition that results in a lysine to glutamic acid substitution at amino acid position 700 (K700E) (Papaemmanuil et al., 2011; Yoshida et al., 2011). The absence of nonsense or frameshift mutations and the presence of specific amino acid substitutions in each of the three most commonly mutated spliceosome genes suggest that specific alterations of function are required for their pathogenesis in MDS. SF3B1 mutations are present in 25% of all MDS cases (Garcia-Manero, 2012; Malcovati et al., 2011) and in more than 85% of cases of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), a form of MDS characterized by an isolated anemia, erythroid dysplasia, and the presence of at least 15% ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow (Malcovati et al., 2011; Mufti et al., 2008; Papaemmanuil et al., 2011; Vardiman et al., 2002; Yoshida et al., 2011). Ring sideroblasts are erythroid precursors with pathologically iron-laden mitochondria encircling the nucleus (Cartwright and Deiss, 1975; Mufti et al., 2008). Several studies have attempted to decipher the role of MDS-associated splicing factor mutations in malignant hematopoiesis in vivo. Mouse models of MDS-associated splicing factor mutations in Srsf2 (Kim et al., 2015) and U2AF1 (Shirai et al., 2015) exhibit features of MDS, including cytopenias and an increase in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Transcriptome analysis has revealed distinct splicing abnormalities between the two genotypes related to their function within the spliceosome. In this article, we describe a hematopoietic-specific conditional knockin mouse model of Sf3b1K700E and characterize its effects on malignant hematopoiesis, pre-mRNA splicing, and the pathogenesis of MDS. RESULTS Physiologic, Hematopoietic-Specific SF3B1K700E Expression Causes a Progressive Macrocytic Anemia To study the role of SF3B1 mutations in the pathogenesis of MDS, we generated an Sf3b1K700E conditional knockin mouse (Figure 1A). Mice heterozygous for the allele (denoted Sf3b1+/K700E) were crossed with Mx1-Cre transgenic animals, and expression of Cre recombinase was induced with polyinosine-polycytosine (pIpC) injection (Jaisser, 2000; Kuhn et al., 1995). We confirmed recombination by PCR performed on genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood 3 weeks after pIpC injection (Figure 1B). Expression of the A2213G mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of cDNA isolated from peripheral blood (Figure 1C) and by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Figure S1A). We confirmed that total Sf3b1 expression was similar between wild-type Mx1- Cre-positive littermates (denoted Sf3b1+/+), Sf3b1+/K700E mice, and Mx1-Cre-negative mice that carried the targeting construct (denoted Flox Cre Negative) by qRT-PCR (Figure S1B). We analyzed 11 Sf3b1+/K700E mice and nine littermate controls for a period of 64 weeks following pIpC treatment. Compared with Sf3b1+/+ littermate controls, Sf3b1+/K700E mice developed a progressive anemia. Anemia was present as early as 4–8 weeks post pIpC and was more severe by 20 weeks post pIpC (Figure 1D). Macrocytosis, an abnormal increase in the erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV), was apparent at 20 weeks post pIpC (Figure 1E). The total red blood cell number was also consistently lower in Sf3b1+/K700E mice than in Sf3b1+/+ littermates beginning at 20 weeks post pIpC (Figure S1C). In response to the anemia, plasma erythropoietin levels in Sf3b1+/K700E mice increased as early as 12 weeks post pIpC (Figure 1F) and persisted for longer than 60 weeks (Figure S1D). However, the reticulocyte counts in Sf3b1+/K700E mice remained inappropriately normal over the course of the 64 weeks (Figure S1E). These findings suggest that a red blood cell production defect is associated with SF3B1K700E expression. No significant differences were observed in the total white blood cell count, mature white blood cell lineages, or platelet counts between the two groups (Figures S1F–S1H). All of the Sf3b1+/+ mice were alive at 64 weeks post pIpC, whereas two of the Sf3b1+/K700E mice died (18%, Figure S1I). No animals developed acute leukemia. To determine whether the erythroid-specific effects we observed with SF3B1K700E expression are cell intrinsic, we performed noncompetitive bone marrow transplantation experiments. Four weeks after pIpC treatment, unfractionated bone marrow from Sf3b1+/K700E and Sf3b1+/+ CD45.2+ littermate donors was transplanted into lethally irradiated congenic CD45.1+ B6.SJL wild-type recipients. Donor chimerism was >95% in both recipient groups over the course of the experiment (Figure S1J). Similar to the phenotype of Sf3b1+/K700E primary mice, Sf3b1+/K700E recipient mice developed a macrocytic anemia within 12 weeks after transplantation (Figures 1G and 1H). White blood cell and platelet counts remained normal (Figures S1K and S1L). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that heterozygous expression of SF3B1K700E causes a progressive, macrocytic anemia associated with a compensatory increase in plasma erythropoietin levels and relative preservation of the white blood cell and platelet counts. Cancer Cell 30, 404–417, September 12, 2016 405 SF3B1K700E Expression Is Associated with a Block in Terminal Erythroid Maturation and Erythroid Dysplasia To characterize the pathogenesis of the anemia seen in Sf3b1+/K700E mice, we examined committed erythroid precursor maturation in the spleen and bone marrow of Sf3b1+/+ and Sf3b1+/K700E mice based on CD71 and Ter119 expression, which subdivides cells into stages R1–R4 of erythroblast maturation (Figure S2A) (Socolovsky et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2003). We observed a block in erythroblast development, characterized by an accumulation of cells in stage R2 of erythroblast maturation and a concomitant decrease in the stage R4 population in both the spleen (Figure 2A) and bone marrow (Figure S2B) of Sf3b1+/K700E animals, but not in littermate controls, 64 weeks post pIpC. These changes are most prominent in the spleen, the primary site of stress erythropoiesis in mice. We did not observe this block in erythroid maturation in the spleen or bone marrow of young mice (12 weeks post pIpC, Figures S2C and S2D), consistent with the onset of primary MDS in older patients (Garcia-Manero, 2012). A similar block in erythroid differentiation was also apparent using a more recently reported methodology for characterizing terminal erythropoiesis (Liu et al., 2013) using A B C D E F G H Figure 1.

Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001. See also Figure S1. forward scatter, Ter119 expression, and CD44 expression (Figures S2E–S2G). We next evaluated the effects of the SF3B1K700E mutation on stress erythropoiesis by treating mice with phenylhydrazine (PHZ), a drug that induces rapid intravascular hemolysis (Socolovsky et al., 2001). We injected primary Sf3b1+/+ and Sf3b1+/K700E mice subcutaneously with 30 mg/kg PHZ on days 0 and 1 and then monitored the hemoglobin (Hb) and absolute reticulocyte counts. Experiments were performed on 11-week-old mice, 3 weeks post pIpC, to assess stress erythropoiesis at a time when the mice did not have a significant baseline anemia. Following PHZ treatment, the Hb nadir of Sf3b1+/K700E mice occurred earlier and was significantly lower than the Hb nadir of Sf3b1+/+ controls (Figure 2B). Although not statistically significant, the rise in the reticulocyte count in response to PHZ was lower in Sf3b1+/K700E mice compared with Sf3b1+/+ mice on days 3 and 6 (Figure S2H). We also assessed erythroblast maturation with CD71 and Ter119 staining, 9 days after PHZ treatment, and noted impaired erythroblast maturation in the spleens of PHZ-treated Sf3b1+/K700E mice (Figure 2C). This is in contrast to the spleens of similarly aged, young Sf3b1+/K700E mice that were not treated with PHZ (Figure S2C). Although several studies have reported that Sf3b1 heterozygous (Sf3b1+/) mice do not develop progressive macrocytic anemia (Matsunawa et al., 2014; Visconte et al., 2012b; Wang et al., 2014), erythroid maturation was only specifically measured 406 Cancer Cell 30, 404–417, September 12, 2016 in one study where no differences were seen (Wang et al., 2011). Visconte et al. (2014) subsequently observed an intermittent increase in MCV and a statistically significant decrease in Hb at 11 months in Sf3b1+/ mice. We therefore sought to compare Sf3b1+/+ and Sf3b1+/K700E erythroblast maturation using an in vitro culture system that closely mimics the in vivo terminal proliferation and maturation of erythroid cells. Equal numbers of c-Kit+ HSPCs were isolated from the bone marrow of Sf3b1+/+ and Sf3b1+/K700E mice, and the cells were cultured in the presence of cytokines that induce erythroid differentiation (Ishikawa et al., 2014). Although both the Sf3b1+/+ and Sf3b1+/K700E HSPCs differentiated in culture, the total number of cells (Figure 2D) and the absolute number of cells at each stage of erythroid maturation (Figure 2E) were significantly lower in cells derived from the Sf3b1+/K700E animals compared with Sf3b1+/+ animals. Cell-cycle analysis revealed a signifi- cantly lower percentage of Sf3b1+/K700E cells in G1 and a higher percentage of Sf3b1+/K700E cells in G0 compared with Sf3b1+/+ erythroblasts (Figure 2F). There was no difference in apoptosis based on annexin V staining (Figure S2I). In contrast to the Sf3b1+/K700E HSPCs, in vitro erythroid differentiation of Sf3b1+/ HSPCs was not impaired (Figures S2J and S2K). There are also conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether Sf3b1 haploinsufficiency causes dyserythropoiesis and ring sideroblast formation. Visconte et al. (2012b, 2014) noted rare ring sideroblasts and some dyserythropoietic features in the bone marrow of Sf3b1+/ mice. In contrast, two independent groups quantified the number of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow of Sf3b1+/+ and Sf3b1+/ mice and found no differences between these animals (Matsunawa et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). We performed an extensive review of the peripheral blood and bone marrow of Sf3b1+/+ and Sf3b1+/K700E mice and did not find a statistically significant increase in ring sideroblasts or circulating siderocytes, enucleated red blood cells with one or more Perls’ stain-positive iron granules, in the Sf3b1+/K700E animals (data not shown).

However, we did observe an increase in erythroid precursors and erythroid dysplasia in the spleens of Sf3b1+/K700E mice (Figures 2G and 2H). No significant differences in bone marrow cellularity were observed between Sf3b1+/+ and Sf3b1+/K700E mice (data not shown). In aggregate, these data demonstrate that hematopoietic-specific expression of the Sf3b1K700E allele in mice leads to impaired terminal erythroid maturation, which is exacerbated by age and stress erythropoiesis.

Unfractionated bone marrow cells (1 3 106 ) from CD45.2+ Sf3b1+/+ or Sf3b1+/700E mice were mixed 1:1 with CD45.1+ B6.SJL unfractionated bone marrow cells and transplanted into lethally irradiated (10.5 Gy) B6.SJL recipients (n = 5 mice per group).

Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05. See also Figure S3. pIpC treatment. Although we found no significant difference in the frequency of Lin– Sca-1+ c-Kit+ (LSK) cells (data not shown), we observed a significant increase in the frequency of CD150+ CD48– LSK long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMPs) in aged Sf3b1+/K700E mice (Figures 3A and 3B). We observed no significant differences in the frequency of short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs), multi-potent progenitors (MPPs), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEPs), or colony-forming units in methylcellulose assays (Figures 3A–3C). To investigate whether this increase in LT-HSCs was due to increased self-renewal in vivo, we performed competitive repopulation experiments. Four weeks after pIpC treatment, 1 million unfractionated bone marrow cells from CD45.2+ Sf3b1+/K700E or Sf3b1+/+ littermates were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with unfractionated bone marrow cells from congenic CD45.1+ B6.SJL mice and injected into lethally irradiated CD45.1+ B6.SJL recipients. At all time points analyzed, we observed significantly lower peripheral blood chimerism in the Sf3b1+/K700E recipient mice compared with the Sf3b1+/+ recipient mice (Figure 3D). CD45.2 chimerism was significantly lower in all stem and progenitor cells (Figure 3E), and we did not observe any skewing of mature white blood cells 408 Cancer Cell 30, 404–417, September 12, 2016 alternative 3’ ss alternative 5’ ss exon inclusion exon skipping intron retention intron skipping 0 20 40 60 Number of Splicing Events Number of Splicing Events A C D E B 0 20 40 60 80 100 −80 −60 −40 −20 0 Distance to canonical AG (nt) 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 Proportion RefSeq (n=150490) SF3B1-mutant MDS patients (n=61) Sf3b1+/K700E Mouse (n=21) cryptic 3’ ss Polypyrimidine Tract canonical 3’ ss Exon Motif associated with cryptic 3’ ss Motif associated with canonical 3’ ss Motif associated with canonical 3’ ss Motif associated with cryptic 3’ ss F AG (3’ splice site) Enrichment of A 0 2 4 6 8 10 Adenine counts between -8 and -18 upstream of AG Cryptic junctions Canonical junctions p < 0.0001 Figure 4.

(legend continued on next page) Cancer Cell 30, 404–417, September 12, 2016 409 derived from Sf3b1+/K700E HSPCs (Figures S3A–S3C). Given the low level of peripheral blood chimerism noted as early as 4 weeks after transplantation, we cannot completely rule out an engraftment defect in the Sf3b1+/K700E cells. However, we have observed similar engraftment of Sf3b1+/K700E and Sf3b1+/+ bone marrow cells in noncompetitive transplant experiments (Figure S1J). Taken together, these data suggest that hematopoietic-specific expression of SF3B1K700E is associated with an increase in the frequency of immunophenotypic LT-HSCs in the bone marrow, but a significantly impaired capacity to reconstitute hematopoiesis in a competitive transplantation setting, relative to Sf3b1+/+ cells. SF3B1K700E Expression Leads to Increased Alternative 30 Splice-Site Usage To determine whether SF3B1K700E expression is associated with mutation-specific alterations in pre-mRNA splicing, we performed RNA-seq on myeloid progenitor (Lin– c-Kit+ , LK) cells sorted from three Sf3b1+/K700E and three Sf3b1+/+ mice, 4 weeks after pIpC administration. Sf3b1K700E mutant allele expression was 27%–32% (Figure S1A). We identified 72 aberrant splicing events that were specific to Sf3b1+/K700E myeloid progenitors (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.1), with 48 of 72 (66%) of these events representing alternative 30 splicing events (Figure 4A). To extend these findings to human samples, we performed RNA-seq on unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from six SF3B1-mutant and four SF3B1-wild-type MDS patient samples matched for MDS subtype, prognostic score, karyotype, and the presence or absence of additional MDS-associated mutations (Table 1). In total, 134 aberrant splicing events were identified in patient samples with SF3B1 mutations (FDR < 0.05, Figure 4B). Although comparison of the differentially spliced genes identified in human SF3B1-mutant MDS and Sf3b1+/K700E myeloid progenitor cells revealed minimal overlap (Tables S1 and S2), the types of splicing events were remarkably similar. As observed in murine Sf3b1-mutant cells, the most common aberrant splicing event in SF3B1-mutated MDS samples was alternative 30 ss selection (91 of 134, 67.9%; Figure 4B). The locations of the cryptic 30 ss in mouse and human cells were both between 15 and 24 nt upstream of the canonical 30 ss (Figure 4C), similar to recently published reports studying 30 ss selection in other SF3B1-mutant cancers (Alsafadi et al., 2016; Darman et al., 2015; DeBoever et al., 2015). Finally, the sequence contexts associated with the cryptic 30 ss in both the Sf3b1+/K700E myeloid progenitors (Figure 4D) and SF3B1-mutant MDS patient samples (Figure 4E) are both characterized by upstream adenosine enrichment and a shorter/weaker polypyrimidine tract (Figure 4F and data not shown), motifs which are in accord with mutant SF3B1-specific cryptic ss previously reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and several solid tumor patient samples and cell lines (Alsafadi et al., 2016; Darman et al., 2015). Additional computational analysis of the sequences between each cryptic and canonical 30 ss revealed eight genes that were differentially spliced in the presence of mutant SF3B1 in both human and murine cells (FDR < 0.05, Table 2). Three of the cryptic 30 ss were in junctions that were R95% conserved between mice and humans. Two of these genes are predicted to be involved in RNA processing: SKIV2L encodes a putative RNA helicase predicted to block translation of poly(A)-deficient mRNA; SERBP1 is predicted to encode an RNA-binding protein with a role in the regulation of mRNA stability. The lack of overlapping genes between human and murine samples is likely due to the poor conservation of intronic DNA sequences between species (Roy and Gilbert, 2006). This is illustrated by ABCB7, a heme transporter known to be mutated (D and E) Consensus 30 ss motif near the canonical (bottom) 30 AG dinucleotide and cryptic (top) 30 AG dinucleotide for 21 alternative 30 splicing events identified in Sf3b1+/K700E compared with Sf3b1+/+ myeloid progenitor cells (D) and 67 alternative 30 splicing events identified in SF3B1-mutant compared with wild-type SF3B1 bone marrow mononuclear cells (E). Motif components are underlined and defined in the key. (F) The number of adenosines found 8–18 nt upstream of the cryptic AG compared with the canonical AG in six SF3B1-mutant MDS patient samples.

In our human MDS data, we also observed the aberrant splicing of ABCB7 described by Darman et al. (2015) in an isogenic B cell line expressing the SF3B1K700E mutation (Figure S4A). However, the sequence for the ABCB7 cryptic ss is not conserved in mice, and we did not observe aberrant splicing of Abcb7 in the Sf3b1-mutant murine cells. Gene set enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed significant changes in genes involved in RNA processing and metabolism, cell cycle, heme metabolism, and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD, Table S3). NMD was predicted to occur in 36.8% of the altered murine transcripts with an FDR <0.1, and 32.7% of the altered human transcripts with an FDR <0.05 (Tables S1 and S2). Gene-expression analysis of the murine (Figure S4B) and human (Figure S4C) genes with altered transcripts predicted to undergo NMD revealed that their expression was significantly less than the expression of genes with altered transcripts that were not predicted to undergo NMD (p = 0.0003). These data demonstrate that Sf3b1+/K700E myeloid progenitors and SF3B1-mutant MDS samples faithfully recapitulate the alterations in pre-mRNA splicing observed in other cancer cells with SF3B1 mutations. Additive Effect of Sf3b1K700E Mutation and Tet2 Deletion on MDS Pathogenesis Loss-of-function mutations in TET2 occur in more than 20% of MDS patient samples (Bejar et al., 2011; Langemeijer et al., 2009), and SF3B1 and TET2 mutations commonly co-occur in patients with MDS (Bejar et al., 2012; Haferlach et al., 2014). To study the effect of this combination of mutations on MDS pathogenesis, we crossed Sf3b1+/K700E mice with a previously characterized conditional Tet2 knockout mouse (Moran-Crusio et al., 2011; Quivoron et al., 2011). Both Sf3b1+/K700E and Sf3b1+/K700E Tet2/ mice developed a progressive macrocytic anemia (Figures 5A and 5B), with Sf3b1+/K700E Tet2/ mice exhibiting a more severe anemia and macrocytosis. Moreover, the double-mutant mice display an accelerated terminal erythroid maturation block compared with mice harboring either mutation alone, as early as 12 weeks post pIpC (Figure 5C). By 45 weeks post pIpC, this block in erythroid maturation is apparent in all of the mutant animals (Figure 5D). Analysis of mature white blood cells at 45 weeks post pIpC was notable for an increased percentage of granulocytes associated with homozygous Tet2 loss. A statistically significant increase in the percentage of granulocytes was noted in the peripheral blood of Tet2/ mice (Figure S5A). Compared with Sf3b1+/+ and Sf3b1+/K700E mice, both Tet2 / and Sf3b1+/K700E Tet2/ mice had a statistically significant increase in the percentage of granulocytes and a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of B cells in both the spleen (Figure S5B) and the bone marrow (Figure S5C). At 12 weeks, we found a small but reproducible increase in the frequency of LT-HSCs in Sf3b1+/K700E Tet2/ mice compared with Sf3b1+/+ mice (Figure 5E). By 45 weeks this expansion of LT-HSCs in Sf3b1+/K700E Tet2/ mice was more marked when compared with the increase observed in Sf3b1+/K700E (p = 0.028) or Tet2/ (p = 0.00768) mice (Figure 5F). The spleens of Sf3b1+/K700E Tet2/ mice were enlarged, similar to those of Tet2/ mice (Figure S5D). Consistent with an additive effect of these mutations on MDS pathogenesis, histopathological analysis of the spleens of the double-mutant animals was notable for dysplastic erythroid progenitors and megakaryocytes (Figure 5G). We did not observe a statistically significant decrease in survival in the double-mutant animals (Figure S5E), and none of the animals developed leukemia during the course of these experiments. We next compared the function of double-mutant and singlemutant stem cells in competitive repopulation experiments.

In addition, the peripheral blood chimerism in Sf3b1+/K700E Tet2/ recipients increased over time with a delayed onset, but similar slope, compared with Tet2/ recipients. Analysis of mature lineages was notable for a multi-lineage competitive advantage in Tet2/ recipients, as reported previously (Quivoron et al., 2011); however, Sf3b1+/K700E Tet2/ recipients showed myeloid skewing that was most notable in the peripheral blood and spleen (Figure S5F–S5H). Flow cytometric analysis of the stem and progenitor cells 24 weeks after transplantation demonstrated increasing donor chimerism in Sf3b1+/K700E Tet2/ recipient mice as their bone marrow cells matured from LT-HSCs (46.5% CD45.2+ cells) to more committed myeloid progenitors (80%–90% CD45.2+ cells; Figures S5I and S5J). This is in contrast to Tet2/ recipients that had nearly 100% donor chimerism in all stem and progenitor cell compartments by 24 weeks and Sf3b1+/K700E bone marrow recipients that had low levels of donor chimerism in all stem and progenitor cell compartments. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Tet2 loss exacerbates the macrocytic anemia and impaired terminal erythroid maturation caused by SF3B1K700E expression and causes an earlier expansion of LT-HSCs in the double-mutant bone marrow. Furthermore, loss of Tet2 rescues the impaired competitive repopulating activity conferred by Sf3b1+/K700E. These phenotypes of the Sf3b1+/K700E Tet2/ mice faithfully recapitulate cardinal features of MDS (Beachy and Aplan, 2010). Cells Expressing SF3B1K700E Have an Increased Sensitivity to Therapeutic Spliceosome Modulation Screens to identify naturally occurring products with antitumor activity led to the identification of microbial products that specifically inhibit SF3b complex function (Kaida et al., 2007; Kotake et al., 2007; Mizui et al., 2004; Nakajima et al., 1996a, 1996b). E7107 is a derivative of naturally occurring pladienolides that has been shown to inhibit spliceosome assembly (Eskens et al., 2013; Folco et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2014). As splicing factor mutations are uniformly heterozygous and mutually exclusive (Yoshida et al., 2011), we hypothesized that survival of Sf3b1-mutant cells may be dependent on the activity of the residual wild-type Sf3b1 allele and that cells heterozygous for Sf3b1 mutations may therefore have increased sensitivity to spliceosome modulators. We tested this hypothesis in vitro using c-Kit+ HSPCs isolated from the bone marrow of Sf3b1+/+ or Sf3b1+/K700E mice. We treated the cells with E7107 for 72 hr and observed that although Sf3b1+/+ murine HSPCs are sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of E7107 (IC50 = 1.249 nM), Sf3b1+/K700E HSPCs are sensitive to even lower concentrations of the drug (IC50 = 0.619 nM, Figure 6A). To evaluate the activity of E7107 against Sf3b1+/K700E HSPCs in vivo, we treated competitive transplant recipients with E7107 for a total of 10 days (Figure 6B). Lethally irradiated B6.SJL mice were transplanted with a 1:20 ratio of B6.SJL to either Sf3b1+/+ or Sf3b1+/K700E unfractionated bone marrow. We assessed initial engraftment 4 weeks after transplantation and found that the peripheral blood CD45.2 chimerism was above 50% in both recipient groups, although lower in the Sf3b1+/K700E recipients (Figure 6C). We observed a statistically significant decrease in CD45.2 chimerism in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleens of Sf3b1+/K700E recipients treated with E7107 compared with those treated with vehicle alone (Figures 6C, 6D, and S6A). A similar decrease in chimerism was not seen in Sf3b1+/+ recipients treated with E7107. Treatment of Sf3b1+/K700E recipients with E7107 was also associated with a statistically significant decrease in lymphoid and myeloid CD45.2 chimerism, LK chimerism, and a lower, though not statistically significant decrease in LSK chimerism (Figures S6B, 6E, and 6F). Taken together, these data show that HSPCs expressing mutant SF3B1 have an increased sensitivity to pharmacologic spliceosome modulation compared with wild-type HSPCs. DISCUSSION We demonstrate that heterozygous, hematopoietic-restricted expression of SF3B1K700E is sufficient to cause characteristic features of MDS, including a macrocytic anemia due to a block in terminal erythropoiesis, erythroid dysplasia, and expansion of LT-HSCs in the bone marrow. The finding that SF3B1 mutations in patients with MDS are uniformly heterozygous missense mutations at highly restricted amino acid residues, rather than a range of inactivating mutations, suggests that these mutations confer an alteration of function instead of a loss of protein function. RNA-seq of Sf3b1+/K700E myeloid progenitor cells and SF3B1-mutant bone marrow mononuclear cells from MDS patients showed that mutant SF3B1 expression is most commonly associated with aberrant 30 mRNA splicing. The motif associated with the cryptic 30 ss is conserved between SF3B1-mutant human and murine samples and is characterized by an enrichment of adenosines and a short polypyrimidine tract upstream of the cryptic 30 ss. This splicing abnormality has also been reported in SF3B1-mutant CLL samples and solid tumors including breast Figure 5.

The hematopoietic phenotype of the Sf3b1+/K700E conditional knockin mouse is distinct from that reported in studies of heterozygous deletion of Sf3b1 (Matsunawa et al., 2014; Visconte et al., 2012b, 2014; Wang et al., 2014). Haploinsufficiency of Sf3b1 is not associated with anemia, a block in terminal erythroid maturation, or statistically significant differences in HSPC frequencies in mice followed for up to 70 weeks (Matsunawa et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). We did not observe substantial numbers of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow of Sf3b1+/K700E animals, as seen in MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations. Murine models of other genetic mutations that lead to sideroblastic anemia in humans also do not produce ring sideroblasts in mice, including loss of Abcb7 (Friedman et al., 2004; Keyhani et al., 1974; Pondarre et al., 2007). We found that more than 30% of both the murine and human genes with aberrant splicing associated with SF3B1 mutations were predicted to undergo NMD. Genes predicted to undergo NMD had decreased expression compared with genes that were not predicted to undergo NMD. Of note, the splicing abnormality in SF3B1-mutant cancers is distinct from the aberrant splicing associated with mutations in Srsf2 (Kim et al., 2015) and U2AF1 (Shirai et al., 2015). This may contribute to the mutual exclusivity as well as the MDS subtype specificity of splicing factor mutations in MDS. As SF3B1 and TET2 mutations co-occur in patients with MDS (Bejar et al., 2012; Haferlach et al., 2014), we generated doublemutant mice to evaluate the effect of the combination of these mutations. We found that Sf3b1+/K700E Tet2/ mice develop an earlier and more pronounced anemia, a more profound and accelerated expansion of the LT-HSC compartment, and erythroid and megakaryocyte dysplasia. We also found that the combination of Tet2 loss and SF3B1K700E expression is suf- ficient to rescue the competitive repopulation disadvantage induced by expression of SF3B1K700E alone. The additive effects of Tet2 loss and SF3B1K700E expression on the HSPCs from the double-mutant animals may explain why mutations in both of these genes are well tolerated in MDS patient samples. Finally, we demonstrated that HSPCs expressing SF3B1K700E have an increased sensitivity to the spliceosome modulator, E7107, both in vitro and in vivo. Sf3b1 mutation therefore sensitizes cells to pharmacologic targeting of wild-type SF3B1, consistent with the observation that the growth of SF3B1-mutant endometrial cancer and uveal melanoma cell lines is impaired by deletion of wild-type, but not mutant, SF3B1 (Zhou et al., 2015). These findings suggest that there may be a therapeutic window for the use of spliceosome modulators in the treatment of hematologic malignancies with SF3B1 mutations.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and related disorders (myelodysplasia) comprise a group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by deregulated, dysplastic blood cell production and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)1 . Although the prevalence ofMDS has not been determined precisely, more than 10,000 people are estimated to develop myelodysplasia annually in the United States2 . Their indolent clinical course before leukaemic transformation and ineffective haematopoiesis with evidence of myeloid dysplasia indicate a pathogenesis distinct from that involved in de novo AML. Currently, a number of gene mutations and cytogenetic changes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS, including mutations of RAS, TP53 and RUNX1, and more recently ASXL1, c-CBL, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, TET2 and EZH2 (ref. 3). Nevertheless, mutations of this set of genes do not fully explain the pathogenesis of MDS because they are also commonly found in other myeloid malignancies and roughly 20% of MDS cases have no known genetic changes (ref. 4 and unpublished data). In particular, the genetic alterations responsible for the dysplastic phenotypes and ineffective haematopoiesis of myelodysplasia are poorly understood. Meanwhile, the recent development of massively parallel sequencing technologies has provided an expanded opportunity to discover genetic changes across the entire genomes or protein-coding sequences in human cancers at a single-nucleotide level5–10, which could be successfully applied to the genetic analysis of myelodysplasia to obtain a better understanding of its pathogenesis. Overview of genetic alterations In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of paired tumour/control DNA from 29 patients with myelodysplasia (Supplementary Table 1). Although incapable of detecting non-coding mutations and gene rearrangements, the whole-exome approach is a well-established strategy for obtaining comprehensive registries of protein-coding mutations at low cost and high performance. With a mean coverage of 133.8, 80.4% of the target sequences were analysed at more than 320 depth on average (Supplementary Fig. 1). All the candidates for somatic mutations (N 5 497) generated through our data analysis pipeline were subjected to validation using Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Methods I and Supplementary Fig. 2). Finally, 268 non-synonymous somatic mutations were confirmed with an overall true positive rate of 53.9% (Supplementary Fig. 3), including 206 missense, 25 nonsense, and 10 splice site mutations, and 27 frameshift-causing insertions/deletions (indels) (Supplementary Fig. 4). The mutation rate of 9.2 (0–21) per sample was significantly lower than that in solid tumours (16.2–302)7,11,12 and multiple myeloma (32.4)6 , but was comparable to that in AML (7.3–13)13–15 and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (11.5)16. Combined with the genomic copy number profile obtained by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array karyotyping, this array of somatic mutations provided a landscape of myelodysplasia genomes (Supplementary Fig. 5)17,18. 1 Cancer Genomics Project, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan. 2 Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 3 Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Manheim of the University of Heidelberg, 1–3 Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer, Mannheim 68167, Germany. 4 Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 5 Laboratory of Functional Genomics, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 6 Laboratory of Sequence Data Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 7 Division of Systems Biomedical Technology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 8 Nakauchi Stem Cell and Organ Regeneration Project, Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. 9 Department of Hematology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, 305-8571, Japan. 10Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Ohtsuka Hospital, 2-8-1 Minami-Ohtsuka, Toshima-ku, Tokyo 170-0005, Japan. 11Division of Hematology, Internal Medicine, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, 1-30 Fujigaoka, Aoba-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 227-8501, Japan. 12Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich 81377, Germany. 13Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8700 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA. 14National University of Singapore, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, 28 Medical Drive, Singapore 117456, Singapore. 15Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University, 199 Tung Hwa North Rd, Taipei 105, Taiwan. *These authors contributed equally to this work. 64 | NATURE | VOL 478 | 6 OCTOBER 2011 ©2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved Novel gene targets in myelodysplasia The list of the somatic mutations (Supplementary Table 2) included most of the known gene targets in myelodysplasia with similar mutation frequencies to those previously reported, indicating an acceptable sensitivity of the current study. The mutations of the known gene targets, however, accounted for only 12.3% of all detected mutations (N 5 33), and the remaining 235 mutations involved previously unreported genes. Among these, recurrently mutated genes in multiple cases are candidate targets of particular interest, for which high mutation rates are expected in general populations. In fact, 8 of the 12 recurrently mutated genes were among the well-described gene targets in myelodysplasia (Supplementary Table 3). However, what immediately drew our attention were the recurrent mutations involving U2AF35 (also known as U2AF1), ZRSR2 and SRSF2 (SC35), because they belong to the common pathway known as RNA splicing. Including an additional three genes mutated in single cases (SF3A1, SF3B1 and PRPF40B), six components of the splicing machinery were mutated in 16 out of the 29 cases (55.2%) in a mutually exclusive manner (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 2). Frequent mutations in splicing machinery RNA splicing is accomplished by a well-ordered recruitment, rearrangement and/or disengagement of a set of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes (U1, U2, and either U4/5/6 or U11/12), as well as many other protein components onto the pre-mRNAs. Notably, the mutated components of the spliceosome were all engaged in the initial steps of RNA splicing, except for PRPF40B, whose functions in RNA splicing are poorly defined. Making physical interactions with SF1 and a serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein, such as SRSF1 or SRSF2, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) that consists of the U2AF65 (U2AF2)– U2AF35 heterodimer, is involved in the recognition of the 39 splice site (39SS) and its nearby polypyrimidine tract, which is thought to be required for the subsequent recruitment of the U2 snRNP, containing SF3A1 as well as SF3B1, to establish the splicing A complex (Fig. 1)19. ZRSR2 (or Urp), is another essential component of the splicing machinery. Showing a close structural similarity to U2AF35, ZRSR2 physically interacts with U2AF65, as well as SRSF1 and SRSF2, with a distinct function from its homologue, U2AF35 (ref. 20). To confirm and extend the initial findings in the whole-exome sequencing, we studied mutations of the above six genes together with three additional spliceosome-related genes, including U2AF65, SF1 and SRSF1, in a large series of myeloid neoplasms (N 5 582) using a high-throughput mutation screen of pooled DNA followed by confirmation/identification of candidate mutations (refs 21 and 22 and Supplementary Methods II). In total, 219 mutations were identified in 209 out of the 582 specimens of myeloid neoplasms through validating 313 provisional positive events in the pooled DNA screen (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). The mutations among four genes, U2AF35 (N 5 37), SRSF2 (N 5 56), ZRSR2 (N 5 23) and SF3B1 (N 5 79), explained most of the mutations with much lower mutational rates for SF3A1 (N 5 8), PRPF40B (N 5 7), U2AF65 (N 5 4) and SF1 (N 5 5) (Fig. 2). Mutations of the splicing machinery were highly specific to diseases showing myelodysplastic features, including MDS either with (84.9%) or without (43.9%) increased ring sideroblasts, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (54.5%), and therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (25.8%), but were rare in de novo AML (6.6%) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (9.4%) (Fig. 3a). The mutually exclusive pattern of the mutations in these splicing pathway genes was confirmed in this large case series, suggesting a common impact of these mutations on RNA splicing and the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia (Fig. 3b). The frequencies of mutations showed significant differences across disease types. Surprisingly, SF3B1 mutations were found in the majority of the cases with MDS characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, that is, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) (19/23 or 82.6%) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia with $ 15% ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (38/50 or 76%) with much lower mutation frequencies in other myeloid neoplasms.

RNA splicing is initiated by the recruitment of U1 snRNP to the 59SS. SF1 and the larger subunit of the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF), U2AF65, bind the branch point sequence (BPS) and its downstream polypyrimidine tract, respectively. The smaller subunit of U2AF (U2AF35) binds to the AG dinucleotide of the 39SS, interacting with both U2AF65 and a SR protein, such as SRSF2, through its UHM and RS domain, comprising the earliest splicing complex (E complex). ZRSR2 also interacts with U2AF and SR proteins to perform essential functions in RNA splicing.

All rights reserved for 4.3% and 12.9% of MDS cases, respectively, where deregulated iron metabolism has been implicated in the development of refractory anaemia23. With such high mutation frequencies and specificity, the SF3B1 mutations were thought to be almost pathognomonic to these MDS subtypes characterized by increased ring sideroblasts, and strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS in these categories. Less conspicuously but significantly, SRSF2 mutations were more frequent in CMML cases (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Thus, although commonly involving the E/A splicing complexes, different mutations may still have different impacts on cell functions, contributing to the determination of discrete disease phenotypes. For example, studies have demonstrated that SRSF2 was also involved in the regulation of DNA stability and that depletion of SRSF2 can lead to genomic instability24. Of interest in this context, regardless of disease subtypes, samples with SRSF2 mutations were shown to have significantly more mutations of other genes compared with U2AF35 mutations (P 5 0.001, multiple regression analysis) (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, with a rare exception of A26V in a single case, the mutations of U2AF35 exclusively involved two highly conserved amino acid positions (S34 or Q157) within the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger motifs flanking the U2AF homology motif (UHM) domain. SRSF2 mutations exclusively occurred at P95 within an intervening sequence between the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and arginine/ serine-rich (RS) domains (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs 8 and 9). Similarly, SF3B1 mutations predominantly involved K700 and, to a lesser extent, K666, H662 and E622, which are also conserved across species (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 10). The involvement of recurrent amino acid positions in these spliceosome genes strongly indicated a gain-of-function nature of these mutations, which has been a welldocumented scenario in other oncogenic mutations25. On the other hand, the 23 mutations in ZRSR2 (Xp22.1) were widely distributed along the entire coding region (Fig. 2). Among these, 14 mutations were nonsense or frameshift changes, or involved splicing donor/acceptor sites that caused either a premature truncation or a large structural change of the protein, leading to loss-of-function. Combined with their strong male preference for the mutation (14/14 cases), ZRSR2 most likely acts as a tumour suppressor gene with an X-linked recessive mode of genetic action. The remaining nine ZRSR2 mutations were missense changes and found in both males (six cases) and females (three cases), whose somatic origin was only confirmed in two cases. However, neither the dbSNP database (build131 and 132) nor the 1000 Genomes database (May 2011 snp calls) contained these missense nucleotides, suggesting that many, if not all, of these missense changes are likely to represent functional somatic changes, especially those found in males. Interrogation of these hot spots for mutations in U2AF35 and SRSF2 found no mutations among lymphoid neoplasms, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (N 5 24) or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (N 5 87) (data not shown). RNA splicing and spliceosome mutations Because the splicing pathway mutations in myelodysplasia widely and specifically affect the major components of the splicing complexes E/A in a mutually exclusive manner, the common consequence of these mutations is logically the impaired recognition of 39SSs that would lead to the production of aberrantly spliced mRNA species. To appreciate this and also to gain an insight into the biological/biochemical impact of these splicing mutations, we expressed the wild-type and the mutant (S34F) U2AF35 in HeLa cells using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) marking (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Methods III) and examined their effects on gene expression in these cells using GeneChip Human genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix), followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Supplementary Methods IV)26. Intriguingly, the GSEA disclosed a significant enrichment of the genes on the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway among the significantly upregulated genes in mutant U2AF35-transduced HeLa cells (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 11a and Supplementary Table 7), which was SRSF2 (0.7%) PRPF40B (0.7%) SF3A1 (0.7%) Dup (0.7%) U2AF35 (1.9%) SRSF2 (1.9%) ZRSR2 (1.9%) PRPF40B (1.9%) SF1 (1.9%) MDS without RS (N = 155) RARS / RCMD-RS (N = 73) CMML (N = 88) De novo AML (N = 151) MPN (N = 53) b RARS/RCMD-RS CMML AML/MDS De novo AML MPN a ZR AML/MDS (N = 62) No mut (90.6%) U2AF35  (11.6%) SRSF2 (11.6%) ZRSR2 (7.7%) SF3B1 (6.5%) No mut (56.1%) SF3B1 (75.3%) No mut (15.1%) SRSF2 (5.5%) U2AF35  (8.0%) SRSF2 (28.4%) ZRSR2 (8.0%) SF3B1 (4.5%) SF3A1 (1.3% ) PRPF40B (1.9%) U2AF65 (0.6%) SF1 (1.3%) Dup (1.3%) Dup (2.7%) ZRSR2 (1.4%) Dup (3.4%) U2AF65 (1.1%) SF3A1 (1.1% ) No mut (74.2%) U2AF35  (9.7%) SRSF2  (6.5%) ZRSR2 (1.6%) SF3B1 (4.8%) SF3A1 (1.6% ) PRPF40B (1.6% ) No mut (93.4%) U2AF35 (1.3%) SF3B1 (2.6%) No mut (45.5%) MDS without RS SF3B1 SRSF2 U2AF35 ZRSR2 SF3A1 PRPF40B U2AF65 SF1 Figure 3 | Frequencies and distribution of spliceosome pathway gene mutations in myeloid neoplasms. a, Frequencies of spliceosome pathway mutations among 582 cases with various myeloid neoplasms. b, Distribution of mutations in eight spliceosome genes, where diagnosis of each sample is shown by indicated colours.

All rights reserved confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Methods 5V). A similar result was also observed for the gene expression profile of an MDS-derived cell line (TF-1) transduced with the S34F mutant (Supplementary Figs 11b, c). The NMD activation by themutant U2AF35was suppressed significantly by the cooverexpression of the wild-type protein (Supplementary Fig. 11d), indicating that the effect of the mutant protein was likely to be mediated by inhibition of thefunctions of the wild-type protein. Given that the NMD pathway, known as mRNA surveillance, provides a post-transcriptional mechanism for recognizing and eliminating abnormal transcripts that prematurely terminate translation27, the result of the GSEA analyses indicated that the mutant U2AF35 induced abnormal RNA splicing in HeLa and TF-1 cells, leading to the generation of unspliced RNA species having a premature stop codon and induction of the NMD activity. To confirm this, we next performed whole transcriptome analysis in these cells using the GeneChip Human exon 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix), in which we differentially tracked the behaviour of two discrete sets of probes showing different level of evidence of being exons, that is, ‘Core’ (authentic exons) and ‘non-Core’ (more likely introns) sets (Supplementary Methods IV and Supplementary Fig. 12). As shown in Fig. 4d, the Core and non-Core set probes were differentially enriched among probes showing significant difference in expression between wild-type and mutant-transduced cells (false discovery rate (FDR) 5 0.01). The Core set probes were significantly enriched in those probes significantly downregulated in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells compared with wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, whereas the non-Core set probes were enriched in those probes significantly upregulated in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4e). The significant differential enrichment was also demonstrated, even when all probe sets were included (Fig. 4f). Moreover, the significantly differentially expressed Core set probes tended to be up- and downregulated in wild-type and mutant U2AF35-transduced cells compared with mock-transduced cells, respectively, and vice versa for the differentially expressed non-Core set probes (Fig. 4e). Combined, these exon array results indicated that the wild-type U2AF35 correctly promoted authentic RNA splicing, whereas the mutant U2AF35 inhibited this processes, rendering non-Core and therefore, more likely intronic sequences to remain unspliced. The abnormal splicing in mutantU2AF35-transduced cells was more directly demonstrated by sequencing mRNAs extracted from HeLa cells, in which expression of the wild-type and mutant (S34F) U2AF35 were induced by doxycycline. First, after adjusting by the total number of mapped reads, the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells showed an increased read counts in the exon fraction, but reduced counts in other fractions, compared with mutant U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4g). The reads from the mutant-transduced cells were mapped to broader genomic regions compared with those from the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, which were largely explained by non-exon reads (Fig. 4h). Finally, the number of those reads that encompassed the authentic exon/intron junctions was significantly increased in mutantU2AF35-transduced cells compared withwild-type U2AF35-transduced cells (Fig. 4i and Supplementary Methods VI). These results clearly demonstrated that failure of splicing ubiquitously occurred in mutant U2AF35-transduced cells. A typical example of abnormal splicing in mutant-transduced cells and the list of significantly unspliced exons are shown in Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 8, respectively. Biological consequence of U2AF35 mutations Finally, we examined the biological effects of compromised functions of the E/A splicing complexes. First, TF-1 and HeLa cells were transduced with lentivirus constructs expressing either the S34F U2AF35 mutant or wild-type U2AF35 under a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Figs 14a and 15a), and cell proliferation was examined after the induction of their expression. Unexpectedly, after the induction of gene expression with doxycycline, the mutant U2AF35-transduced cells, but not the wildtype U2AF35-transduced cells, showed reduced cell proliferation (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 15b) with a marked increase in the G2/M fraction (G2/M arrest) together with enhanced apoptosis as a 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.5 2.5 0.5 SMG5 DHX34 UPF1 SMG1 UPF3B BTZ UPF2 SMG7 SMG6 * * * * * * * * * 3.0 Mock S34F U2AF35  P < 0.01 (n = 5) b d 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 P = 0.0026 0.0 SMG5 SMG9 DHX34 UPF1 SMG1 UPF3B BTZ UPF2 SMG7 MAGOH SMG6 SMG8 Y14 eIF4A3 PYM UPF3A hNAG WT S34F Mock S34F WT U2AF35 AntiU2AF35 AntiFlag Anti- β actin HeLa S34F MockWT Normalized intensity S34F WT 10–1 10–3 101 100 10–2 S34F Mock Normalized intensity Enrichment score U2AF35 Hits cNormalized expression e f S.I.

To confirm the growth-suppressive effect of U2AF35 mutants in vitro, a highly purified haematopoietic stem cell population (CD342cKit1ScaI1Lin2, CD342KSL) prepared from C57BL/6 (B6)-Ly5.1 mouse bone marrow28 was retrovirally transduced with either the mutant (S34F, Q157P and Q157R) or wild-type U2AF35, or the mock constructs, each harbouring the EGFP marker gene (Supplementary Fig. 16). The ability of these transduced cells to reconstitute the haematopoietic system was tested in a competitive reconstitution assay. The transduced cells were mixed with whole bone marrow cells from B6-Ly5.1/5.2 F1 mice, transplanted into lethally irradiated B6-Ly5.2 recipients, and peripheral blood chimaerism derived from EGFPpositive cellswasassessed6 weeks after transplantation byflow cytometry. We confirmed that each recipient mouse received comparable numbers of EGFP-positive cells among the different retrovirus groups by estimating the percentage of EGFP-positive cells and overall proliferation in transduced cells by ex vivo tracking. Also no significant difference was observed in their homing capacity to bone marrow as assessed by transwell migration assays (Supplementary Fig. 17). As shown in Fig. 5e, the wild-typeU2AF35-transduced cells showed a slightly higher reconstitution capacity than the mock-transduced cells. On the other hand, the recipients of the cells transduced with the various U2AF35 mutants showed significantly lower EGFP-positive cell chimaerism than those of either the mock- or the wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, indicating a compromised reconstitution capacity of the haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells expressing the U2AF35 mutants. In summary, these mutants lead to loss-of-function of U2AF35 most probably by acting in a dominant-negative fashion to the wild-type protein. Discussion Our whole-exome sequencing study unexpectedly unmasked a complexity of novel pathway mutations found in approximately 45% to 85% of myelodysplasia patients depending on the disease subtypes, which affected multiple but distinctive components of the splicing machinery and, as such, demonstrated the unquestionable power of massively parallel sequencing technologies in cancer research. The RNA splicing system comprises essential cellular machinery, through which eukaryotes can achieve successful transcription and guarantee the functional diversity of their protein species using alternative splicing in the face of a limited number of genes29. Accordingly, the meticulous regulation of this machinery should be indispensable for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis30, deregulation of which causes severe developmental abnormalities31,32. The current discovery of frequent mutations of the splicing pathway in myelodysplasia, therefore, represents another remarkable example that illustrates how cancer develops by targeting critical cellular functions. It also provides an intriguing insight into the mechanism of ‘cancer specific’ alternative splicing, which have long been implicated in the development of cancer, including MDS and other haematopoietic neoplasms33,34. In myelodysplasia, the major targets of spliceosome mutations seemed to be largely confined to the components of the E/A splicing complex, among others to SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF35 and ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent, to SF3A1, SF1, U2AF65 and PRPF40B. The broad coverage of the wide spectrum of spliceosome components in our exome sequencing was likely to preclude frequent involvement of other components on this pathway (Supplementary Fig. 18). The surprising frequency and specificity of these mutations in this complex, together with the mutually exclusive manner they occurred, unequivocally indicate that the compromised function of the E/A complex is a hallmark of this unique category of myeloid neoplasms, playing a central role in the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia. The close relationship between the mutation types and unique disease subtypes also support their pivotal roles in MDS. Given the critical functions of the E/A splicing complex on the precise 39SS recognition, the logical consequence of these relevant mutations would be the impaired splicing involving diverse RNA species. In fact, when expressed in HeLa cells, the mutant U2AF35 induced global abnormalities of RNA splicing, leading to increased production of transcripts having unspliced intronic sequences. On the other hand, the functional link between the abnormal splicing of RNA species and the phenotype of myelodysplasia is still unclear. Mutant U2AF35 seemed to suppress cell growth/proliferation and induce apoptosis rather than confer a growth advantage or promote clonal selection. ZRSR2 knockdown in HeLa cells has been reported to also result in reduced viability, arguing for the common consequence of these pathway mutations35. These observations suggested that the oncogenic actions of these splicing pathway mutations are distinct from what is expected for classical oncogenes, such as mutated kinases and signal transducers, but could be more related to cell differentiation. Of note in this regard, the commonest clinical presentation of MDS is severe cytopenia in multiple cell lineages due to ineffective haematopoiesis with increased apoptosis rather than unlimited cell proliferation1 . In this regard, lessons may be learned from the recent findings on the pathogenesis of the 5q2 syndrome, where haploinsufficiency of RPS14 leads to increased apoptosis of erythroid progenitors, but not myeloproliferation36,37.

All rights reserved pathogenesis of MDS, where the broad spectrum of RNA species affected by impaired splicing hampers identification of responsible gene targets. Moreover, the mutated components of the splicing machinery have distinct function of their own other than direct regulation of RNA splicing, involved in elongation and DNA stability, which may be important to determine specific disease phenotypes. Clearly, more studies are required to answer these questions through understanding of the molecular basis of their oncogenic actions. METHODS SUMMARY Whole-exome sequencing of paired tumour/normal DNA samples from the 29 patients was performed after informed consent was obtained. SNP array-based copy number analysis was performed as previously described17,18. Mutation analysis of the splicing pathway genes in a set of 582 myeloid neoplasms were performed by first screening mutations in PCR-amplified pooled targets from 12 individuals, followed by validation/identification of the candidate mutations within the corresponding 12 individuals by Sanger sequencing. Flag-tagged cDNAs of the wild-type and mutant U2AF35 were generated by in vitro mutagenesis, constructed into a murine stem cell virus-based retroviral vector as well as a tetracycline-inducible lentivirus-based expression vector, and used for gene transfer to CD342KSL cells and cultured cell lines, with EGFP marking, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from wild-type or mutant U2AF35-transduced HeLa and TF-1 cells, and analysed on microarrays. RNA sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Cell proliferation assays (MTT assays) on HeLa and TF-1 cells stably transduced with lentivirus U2AF35 constructs were performed in the presence or absence of doxycycline. For competitive reconstitution assays, CD342KSL cells collected from C57BL/6 (B6)- Ly5.1 mice were retrovirally transduced with various U2AF35 constructs with EGFP marking, and transplanted with competitor cells (B6-Ly5.1/5.2 F1 mouse origin) into lethally irradiated B6-Ly5.2 mice 48 h after gene transduction. Frequency of EGFP-positive cells was assessed in peripheral blood by flow cytometry 6 weeks after the transplantation (Supplementary MethodsVII). The primer sets used for validation of gene mutations and qPCR of NMD gene expression are listed in Supplementary Tables 9211. A complete description of the materials and methods is provided in the Supplementary Information.

136||Precursor mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a macromolecule composed of small nuclear RNAs associated with proteins. The SF3B1 gene encodes subunit 1 of the splicing factor 3b, which is important for anchoring the spliceosome to precursor mRNA. In 2011, whole-exome sequencing studies showed recurrent somatic mutations of SF3B1 and other genes of the RNA splicing machinery in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm. SF3B1 mutations had a particularly high frequency among conditions characterized by ring sideroblasts, which is consistent with a causal relationship. SF3B1 mutants were also detected at a lower frequency in a variety of other tumor types. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, SF3B1 was found to be the second most frequently mutated gene. In myelodysplastic syndromes, SF3B1 mutations appear to be founding genetic lesions and are associated with a low risk of leukemic evolution. In contrast, SF3B1 mutations have a lower incidence in early stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are more common in advanced disease, and tend to be associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that they occur during clonal evolution of the disease. The assessment of SF3B1 mutation status may become innovative diagnostic and prognostic tools and the availability of spliceosome modulators opens novel therapeutic prospects.  Go to: Introduction Until recently, the molecular basis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has remained essentially elusive. In the last few years, however, there have been major advances in this field and it has become apparent that somatic mutations of genes encoding core components of the RNA splicing machinery play a major role in the pathophysiology of MDS and other hematologic malignancies.1–4 In this perspective article, we examine the biologic and clinical significance of mutations in SF3B1, a gene that encodes subunit 1 of the splicing factor 3b protein complex, in myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms.  Go to: Basic concepts of RNA splicing Most eukaryotic genes have coding sequences (exon) and noncoding (intron) sequences and are initially expressed as precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) that includes all of these sequences (Figure 1).5 The term mRNA splicing or maturation defines the process by which introns are excised from pre-mRNA and flanking exons are ligated together.5 In higher eukaryotes, most genes undergo different patterns of splicing, generating alternative mRNA isoforms that have different functions and contribute to biologic complexity.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Schematic representation of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing. Top: Human genes have coding (exon) and noncoding (intron) sequences and are initially expressed as pre-mRNA that includes all of these sequences. In the process of precursor mRNA splicing ... Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a macromolecule composed of 5 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) associated with proteins to form particles termed small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs; Figure 1).6,7 In most eukaryotes, including humans, there are 2 classes of introns: the common U2 type, representing more than 99% of human introns, and the rare U12 type, with the 2 differing in their consensus splice-site sequences. The removal of these 2 types of introns is catalyzed by 2 different spliceosomes called the U2- and U12-dependent spliceosomes, respectively. The 2 spliceosomes differ in their snRNA composition (Figure 1) but share most of the proteins.  The assembly of the spliceosome occurs anew on each pre-mRNA, which contains specific sequences that drive and regulate this process. The crucial signal sequences are the splice donor site (5′ end), the branch site (near the 3′ end), and the splice acceptor site (3′ end of the intron; Figure 1). In the major U2-dependent spliceosome, the donor site is recognized by the U1 snRNP, whereas the branch site is recognized by the U2 snRNP.  Several proteins interact with snRNAs to form snRNPs within the spliceosome.5 Those interacting with U1 and U2 snRNAs in the early phase of intron recognition and spliceosome formation include SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, U2AF65, SF1, SF3B1, SF3A1, and PRPF40B (Table 1).6 The SF3B1 protein is a core component of the U2 snRNP, which binds to the branch site, thereby base-pairing with the intron RNA.6  Table 1 Table 1 Genes encoding proteins that are core components of U1 and U2 snRNPs of the spliceosome, and their mutation status in human malignancies Although transcription of nucleosome-free DNA into pre-mRNA by RNA polymerase II and pre-mRNA splicing are traditionally considered as separate and sequential processes, increasing evidence suggests that transcription and RNA processing are strictly coupled in vivo and that several splicing factors also play a role in the regulation of transcription.8 For an in-depth analysis of this topic, the reader is referred to a recent review by Han et al.9 The concept of cotranscriptional splicing is represented schematically in Figure 2.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Schematic representation of the concept of cotranscriptional RNA splicing and potential outcomes of mutations of genes encoding proteins of the spliceosome. Top: Although transcription of nucleosome-free DNA into pre-mRNA by RNA polymerase II and pre-mRNA ... Go to: Abnormalities of mRNA splicing and human disease Abnormal mRNA splicing may result from mutations of splice-site sequences, mutations in splicing regulatory sequences, and mutations in genes of the splicing machinery itself (ie, spliceosome mutations).  Mutations of the splice-site sequences or splicing regulatory sequences are responsible for a large fraction of human inherited diseases.6,10 For example, β-thalassemia may derive from mutations in splice-site sequences of the HBB gene that cause abnormal splicing of HBB and defective synthesis of its protein, β-globin.11 Conversely, inherited disorders caused by spliceosome mutations (ie, mutations of genes encoding spliceosomal proteins or mutations in spliceosomal RNA) are rare, at least based on our current understanding. For detailed information, the reader is referred to a recent comprehensive review article by Padgett.6  Somatic mutations of spliceosome genes were unknown until recently. From a theoretical point of view, they disrupt several processes downstream, because an altered spliceosome may cause abnormal transcription and altered splicing outcomes of thousands of genes. These outcomes include reduced (or also increased) transcription, exon skipping, intron retention, and cryptic splice site activation with truncated (or elongated) exon (Figure 2). It is now becoming apparent that through these mechanisms, somatic mutations of the RNA splicing machinery can play a role in the pathogenesis of human cancers, in particular in the pathophysiology of hematologic malignancies.  Go to: SF3B1 mutations in myeloid neoplasms The first identification of a somatic mutation of SF3B1 was done at the end of 2010 by investigators of the Chronic Myeloid Disorders Working Group (CMD-WG) of the International Cancer Genome Consortium. When this collaboration was established in the first months of 2010, it was decided to perform whole-exome sequencing studies in patients with MDS, and more specifically in those with myelodysplasia with ring sideroblasts.  MDS are clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by peripheral cytopenia and propensity to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML).12,13 These disorders show impressive clinical heterogeneity, ranging from conditions with a near-normal standardized mortality ratio to entities that are very close to AML.14–16 Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) is a phenotypically well-defined subtype of MDS characterized by erythroblasts with iron-loaded mitochondria, which are visualized by Prussian blue staining (Perls reaction) as a perinuclear ring of blue granules. Ring sideroblasts are also the morphologic hallmark of congenital sideroblastic anemias, inherited disorders because of germline mutations of genes such ALAS2 (X-linked sideroblastic anemia, OMIM #300751), ABCB7 (sideroblastic anemia and spinocerebellar ataxia, OMIM #301310), and SLC25A38 (autosomal recessive pyridoxine-refractory sideroblastic anemia, OMIM #205950).17–20 In patients with RARS, the iron deposited in perinuclear mitochondria of ring sideroblasts is present in the form of mitochondrial ferritin, which is encoded by the FTMT gene and is undetectable in normal erythropoiesis.21,22 In addition, both CD34-positive cells and immature RBCs from RARS patients are characterized by reduced expression of ABCB7,23,24 a gene that encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter involved in the regulation of mitochondrial iron homeostasis.25  The CMD-WG investigators reasoned that the peculiar phenotype of RARS could make easier the identification of recurrently mutated genes and used massively parallel sequencing technology to this purpose. Using this approach, Papaemmanuil et al identified 62 point mutations with a predominance of transitions across 8 RARS patients.2 Very interestingly, 6 of the 8 subjects studied had somatic mutations in SF3B1.  To characterize the spectrum and frequency of SF3B1 mutations, the CMD-WG investigators undertook targeted resequencing of the gene in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.14,26 Somatic mutations of SF3B1 were found in approximately 30% of patients with MDS and in 20% of patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN). SF3B1 was also mutated in smaller proportions of patients with other tumor types. All mutations appeared to be heterozygous substitutions clustered in exons 12-16 of the gene. The K700E mutation accounted for more than 50% of the variants observed, and additional codons (666, 662, 622, and 625) were found to be hot spots for mutation. Results of quantitative evaluation of SF3B1 mutant allele burden were consistent with the presence of a dominant clone with heterozygous SF3B1 mutation in most of the cases and with the existence of a minority mutant clone in a smaller fraction of patients.26  Additional investigations performed by Papaemmanuil et al demonstrated that SF3B1 mutations were less deleterious than expected by chance, implying that the mutated protein retains structural integrity with altered function.2 Furthermore, gene-expression profiling revealed that SF3B1 mutations were associated with down-regulation of key gene networks, including core mitochondrial pathways.2  In the same period that the CMD-WG investigators were conducting whole-exome studies in myelodysplasia with ring sideroblasts, Yoshida et al performed whole-exome sequencing of paired tumor/control DNA from patients with various subtypes of MDS.1 Again, this study unexpectedly revealed novel pathway mutations involving multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery, including U2AF1, ZRSR2, SRSF2, and SF3B1. Targeted analysis in a larger patient population showed that RNA splicing mutations were frequent in patients with MDS and MDS/MPN. More specifically, somatic mutations of SF3B1 were found in 75% of patient with ring sideroblasts, whereas mutations of U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SRSF2 were more common in myeloid disorders without ring sideroblasts. In particular, approximately one-third of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia had somatic mutations of SRSF2.  Go to: Relationship between SF3B1 mutations and ring sideroblasts in myeloid neoplasms In patients with MDS or MDS/MPN, we found a close relationship between ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutations.26 In fact, the SF3B1 mutation status had a positive predictive value for disease phenotype with ring sideroblasts of 97.7% (95% confidence interval, 93.5%-99.5%), whereas the absence of ring sideroblasts had a negative predictive value for SF3B1 mutation of 97.8% (95% confidence interval, 93.8%-99.5%).  The close relationship between SF3B1 mutations and ring sideroblasts in myeloid neoplasms has been confirmed in all subsequent studies.27–32 This is consistent with a causal relationship and makes SF3B1 the first gene to be strongly associated with a specific morphologic feature in myeloid neoplasms.  The molecular mechanisms underlying iron accumulation in the mitochondria of immature RBCs from patients with RARS are currently being investigated. One potential mechanism of ring sideroblast formation might be the reduced expression of the gene ABCB7, which is essential for hematopoiesis33 and mitochondrial iron homeostasis25 and is mutated in the congenital sideroblastic anemia associated with spinocerebellar ataxia.18 Overall, ABCB7 protein deficiency results in mitochondrial iron overload, reduced heme synthesis in immature RBCs, and ineffective erythropoiesis.25 In hematopoietic progenitors and precursors from RARS patients, low levels of ABCB7 expression are typically associated with high levels of FTMT expression.21,34,35 Overexpression of mitochondrial ferritin in RARS erythroblasts occurs at a very early stage of erythroid differentiation,34 suggesting that it might be a cause rather than a consequence of mitochondrial iron overload. A recent study by Nikpour et al has tested the hypothesis that a reduced expression of ABCB7 plays a role in the pathophysiology of RARS.36 The investigators showed that down-regulation of ABCB7 led to markedly reduced erythroid growth in vitro with accumulation of mitochondrial ferritin in immature RBCs. In addition, normalization of ABCB7 expression in RARS erythroblasts rescued aspects of the RARS phenotype. Finally, an altered ABCB7 exon usage was found in primary cells from patients with SF3B1-mutated RARS. These findings suggest that reduced transcription and abnormal splicing of ABCB7 in patients carrying a somatic mutation of SF3B1 may be at least one of the mechanisms that lead to ring sideroblast formation and RARS phenotype, as represented schematically in Figure 3.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Schematic representation of our current understanding of the relationship between the occurrence of a somatic SF3B1 mutation and the formation of ring sideroblasts in patients with RARS. Previous studies found reduced expression of ABCB7 in CD34-positive ... In a study aimed at defining the relationship between dysfunction in SF3B1 and formation of ring sideroblasts, Visconte et al37 found that meayamycin, a pharmacologic inhibitor of the splicing factor 3b complex,38 induced the formation of ring sideroblasts in healthy BM cells in vitro. They were also able to detect ring sideroblasts by Perls staining in Sf3b1 heterozygous-knockout mice and therefore concluded that SF3B1 haploinsufficiency leads to ring sideroblast formation.  Although the majority of SF3B1-mutated RARS patients have a fully dominant clone that is heterozygous for the mutation, their percentage of ring sideroblasts ranges considerably from less than 20% to more than 90%. Although we found a significant relationship between this percentage and SF3B1 mutant allele burden,26 this does not fully explain the above variability, suggesting that additional factors play a role in the RARS phenotypic expression.  In all of the studies published so far, approximately 10%-20% of RARS patients have no evidence of mutations in SF3B1. This may partly reflect inaccuracies in the diagnosis of RARS related to difficulties in the identification of ring sideroblasts.39 However, the possibility exists that other mutant genes of RNA splicing machinery may lead to ring sideroblast formation.1  Go to: Prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations in MDS The close relationship between ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutations in MDS would in principle imply that the mutant gene be associated with a mild clinical course. In fact, RARS is mainly characterized by erythroid dysplasia and ineffective erythropoiesis, and in most patients its clinical course is stable for years with a low risk of leukemic evolution.40–42 In our study on prognostic factors in MDS,15 the life expectancy of RARS patients 70 years or older was not significantly different from that of the general reference population.  The studies published so far on the prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations in MDS have provided conflicting results, as detailed in Table 2. Before examining this issue, we want to emphasize that, for a proper evaluation of the prognostic relevance of any somatic mutation in MDS patients, ad hoc analyses should account for left censoring of the observations at the time of mutation assessment and for right censoring of the observations at the time of any potentially disease-modifying treatment. The striking enrichment of SF3B1 mutation in patients with RARS and its low frequency in patients with excess of blasts would a priori imply that in a population of MDS patients, those carrying a mutant SF3B1 had a better clinical outcome than those with a wild-type gene. This observation has indeed been made by us (Figure 4)26 and others.28 In contrast, 2 studies did not find any significant effect of the mutation on clinical outcome29,30; apparently, these studies did not account for right censoring of the observations at the time of any potentially disease-modifying treatment. In another study including only MDS patients with ring sideroblasts, the presence of SF3B1 mutations was associated with better overall and leukemia-free survival in univariate analysis.27 However, this prognostic value was lost in multivariable analysis including World Health Organization (WHO) morphologic category.27 This was the case also in our study,26 mainly because of the strict collinearity between ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutations. Lastly, in a study on MDS patients with lower-risk disease, mutations of SF3B1 showed only a trend toward longer survival.31  Table 2 Table 2 Recent studies on the prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations in patients with MDS Figure 4 Figure 4 Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival in MDS patients stratified according to SF3B1 mutation status. (A) Overall survival, defined here as the time (in months) between the date of diagnosis and the date of death (for patients who deceased) or last follow-up ... In our study,26 SF3B1 mutation remained an independent predictor of better survival even after adjustment for the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk, whereas its significance was borderline after adjustment for the WHO classification–based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) risk. In a multivariate analysis including WHO categories, when stratifying MDS patients according to unilineage dysplasia, multilineage dysplasia, and excess of blasts, SF3B1 mutation remained an independent predictor of better clinical outcome (M.C., L.M., unpublished observations, October 2012). This effect was lost when stratification included also a “ring sideroblast” category, again because of the strict collinearity between SF3B1 mutation and ring sideroblasts.  Clearly, the positive prognostic value of SF3B1 mutation may be partly or completely lost after acquisition of other somatic mutations, in particular those associated with disease progression. This might be the case, for example, if a patient with SF3B1-mutated RARS acquires an ASXL1 mutation and progresses to a condition characterized by multilineage dysplasia or excess of blasts in addition to ring sideroblasts. Alternatively, an SF3B1 mutation may mitigate the negative impact of other concomitant molecular lesions. A recent study has shown that DNMT3A and SF3B1 mutations commonly cooccur, suggesting a possible biologic cooperativity between the 2 molecular lesions.31 In that study, SF3B1 mutations had a trend toward longer survival and patients with concomitant DNMT3A and SF3B1mutations had a longer median survival than patients with DNMT3A mutations alone. This observation underlines the importance of simultaneously evaluating the mutation status of several genes of potential clinical relevance in the molecular prognostication of any myeloid neoplasm, a concept clearly illustrated also by a recent study in AML patients.43  Go to: SF3B1 mutations in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis RARS associated with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T) is a MDS/MPN characterized by refractory anemia associated with erythroid dysplasia and ringed sideroblasts, platelet count 450 × 109/L or greater, and the presence of large atypical megakaryocytes similar to those observed in BCR/ABL1-negative MPN.44  The majority of patients with RARS-T carry a somatic mutation of SF3B1,26,28 and approximately 50% of them have a somatic mutation of JAK2 or MPL.44–46 A recent analysis of 47 patients with RARS-T strictly matching the 2008 WHO criteria showed that 41 of 47 (87%) subjects carried an SF3B1 mutation, 36 (77%) had JAK2 (V617F), and 30 (64%) had concomitant mutations in SF3B1 and JAK2.32 This reinforces the opinion that RARS-T is a true MDS/MPN at both the clinical and the molecular levels,44 and should no longer be considered a provisional entity in the WHO classification. A recent European collaborative study has shown that patients with RARS-T have better overall survival than those with RARS and shorter overall survival than those with essential thrombocythemia,46 underlying the clinical relevance of interactions between different mutant genes.  We demonstrated previously that RARS-T may develop from RARS through the acquisition of somatic mutations of JAK2, MPL, or other, as-yet-unknown genes.45 In keeping with previous observations, the assessment of the mutant allele burden in RARS-T patients carrying concomitant mutations of SF3B1 and JAK2 showed higher values for SF3B1 mutants compared with JAK2 mutants.26 These considerations suggest that, in a portion of patients, RARS-T may develop through sequential acquisition of SF3B1 and JAK2 mutations, as represented schematically in Figure 5.44 It has been suggested that RARS-T might also develop from a JAK2 (V617F)–mutated MPN through the acquisition of an SF3B1 mutation.32 This is theoretically possible, but less likely than the transition reported in Figure 5, because it would imply that a JAK2 (V617F)–mutated/SF3B1-mutated subclone has a competitive advantage over a JAK2 (V617F)–mutated dominant clone. It should be noted that SF3B1 mutations have not been detected so far in patients with polycythemia vera,2 whereas they have been identified in only 3% of those with essential thrombocythemia2 and in 7% of those with primary myelofibrosis.47  Figure 5 Figure 5 Schematic representation of the multistep molecular pathogenesis of RARS-T through sequential acquisition of SF3B1 and JAK2 or MPL mutations. The occurrence of a somatic mutation of SF3B1 causes mitochondrial iron overload, ineffective erythropoiesis, ... Go to: SF3B1 mutations in CLL Our understanding of the genetics of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has advanced significantly in recent years and the biology of CLL is currently used to choose treatment.48 However, the most striking advances regarding mutant genes have been made possible in the last 2 years by the use of next-generation sequencing technology.  In a comprehensive analysis of CLL combining whole-genome sequencing in 4 cases with targeted resequencing in 363 patients, Puente et al identified 4 genes that were recurrently mutated in CLL patients (NOTCH1, XPO1, MYD88, and KLHL6).49 Wang et al used a similar strategy and analyzed DNA samples from 91 CLL patients (88 exomes and 3 genomes).3 They identified 9 genes that were recurrently mutated: 4 (TP53, ATM, MYD88, and NOTCH1) were already known for their established role in CLL, whereas the remaining 5 genes (SF3B1, FBXW7, ZMYM3, DDX3X, and MAPK1) had not been previously associated with CLL.  In the study by Wang et al, somatic mutations of SF3B1 were found in approximately 15% of patients, making this the second most frequently mutated gene in CLL, and were highly enriched in patients with del(11q).3 Considering that the ATM gene maps on chromosome 11q22-q23, and that 2 patients had point mutations in both ATM and SF3B1 but did not have del(11q), the above enrichment suggests that SF3B1 mutations may be synergistic with loss of ATM. Using an ad hoc assay, Wang et al found alterations in pre-mRNA splicing in tumor samples from CLL patients carrying a somatic mutation of SF3B1.3 With respect to clinical implications, they concluded that SF3B1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis in CLL, because a Cox multivariate regression model revealed that an SF3B1 mutation was predictive of an earlier need for treatment independently of other established predictive factors. This analysis had limitations, mainly because of lack of information on the timing of acquisition of the SF3B1 mutation.50  While investigating the coding genome of fludarabine-refractory CLL, Rossi et al found recurrent mutations of SF3B1, and therefore did targeted resequencing of the gene in 3 different patient cohorts.51 The incidence of SF3B1 mutation was 17% in fludarabine-refractory patients, 5% in newly diagnosed patients, and 6% in patients with Richter syndrome. Serial samples of mutated patients were available in 3 cases and the SF3B1 mutation was found to be acquired during follow-up in 2 of these. SF3B1 mutations were absent among mature B-cell neoplasms other than CLL, and in a separate study,52 a mutant SF3B1 was detected in only one of 63 subjects with clinical monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, a condition that might represent the initial phases of CLL.53  Quesada et al studied 279 untreated patients with CLL and found SF3B1 mutations in 27 (10%).54 As in previous studies, the most frequent mutation was K700E, occurring in almost half of the cases, followed by G742D, a mutation rarely found in myeloid neoplasms. No SF3B1 mutation was detected in 156 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.54 CLL patients with mutations in SF3B1 had more aggressive disease and shorter overall survival than patients without these mutations. The fact that these patients were untreated suggests that SF3B1 mutations may occur during disease development without necessarily being a result of chemotherapy-induced selective pressure.55  Several groups are currently evaluating the clinical significance of SF3B1 mutations in CLL patients. Oscier et al have recently assessed the effect of NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations in a cohort of 494 newly diagnosed CLL patients enrolled in the randomized phase 3 CLL4 trial comparing chlorambucil with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide or fludarabine alone.56 NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations were found in 10% and 17% of untreated CLL patients and were independently associated with shorter survival in multivariate analysis. SF3B1 mutations were enriched in CD38-positive patients. In that study, TP53 abnormalities remained the most important negative prognostic factor, as was found previously in the German CLL Study Group CLL4 trial.57  The available evidence indicates that SF3B1 mutations are specific for CLL among mature B-cell neoplasms, have a lower incidence in early stages of CLL, occur more commonly in advanced disease, and tend to be associated with poor prognosis. Ongoing analyses from the German CLL Study Group will likely provide additional information.  Go to: SF3B1 mutation, clonal dominance, and disease progression in hematologic malignancies Most patients with RARS carrying an SF3B1 mutation have a mutant allele burden between 40% and 50% in both circulating granulocytes and BM CD34-positive cells,26 indicating that the mutation occurs in a hematopoietic progenitor, determines expansion and dominance of a heterozygous clone, and is then transmitted to its myeloid progeny.  The mechanisms by which a mutant SF3B1 protein determines clonal proliferation of a CD34-positive cell have not yet been elucidated. As shown in Figure 2, a spliceosome mutation may cause abnormal transcription and various types of abnormal splicing or alternative splicing events. The fundamental problem is that the spliceosome controls the expression of thousands of genes and it is therefore difficult to identify those that are relevant for clonal expansion of a hematopoietic cell. The current debate as to whether an SF3B1 mutation is a gain-of-function or a loss-of-function mutation is partly meaningless. Because the mutant SF3B1 protein alters transcription and splicing of several genes, deciphering gains and losses is extremely difficult. In addition, even assuming that an SF3B1 mutation can cause clonal expansion and dominance of hematopoietic progenitors, it remains to be explained how the same mutation results in defective maturation of immature RBCs leading to ineffective erythropoiesis. One interpretation is that the abnormal mitochondrial iron homeostasis (Figure 3) results in excessive apoptosis of erythroid cells.  The effects of SF3B1 mutations may also be unrelated to the splicing activity of the protein. In fact, Sf3b1 heterozygous knockout mice have skeletal abnormalities associated with ectopic Hox gene expression.58 This is independent of the alteration of general gene expression and derives from an abnormal interaction with the polycomb group proteins that are responsible for the stable repression of Hox genes.  With respect to CLL, the available evidence indicates that SF3B1 mutations are very unlikely to be founding mutations in this lymphoid neoplasm. More likely, they occur during the clonal progression of the disease and determine the emergence of more aggressive subclones.  Ebert and Bernard4 have proposed the provocative hypothesis that SF3B1 mutations might occur initially in multipotent hematopoietic stem cells and that additional somatic mutations may determine the disease phenotype. In the case of RARS, the SF3B1 mutation must occur in a hematopoietic cell capable of myeloid differentiation26 and can cause a myelodysplastic phenotype without the need of additional mutations.2 With respect to CLL, the SF3B1 mutation is unlikely to be an initiating event. Nonetheless, the notion that myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms can share mutant genes is potentially interesting, as shown by a study on TET2 mutations in malignant lymphomas.59 This is at least consistent that the concept that the same mutation can cause 2 completely different diseases depending on the cell type in which it occurs.  Go to: Potential implications of SF3B1 mutations for molecular diagnosis and prognosis of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms Molecular tools are increasingly being used in the diagnosis and prognostic definition of both myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. The implications of SF3B1 mutations based on the findings of studies published so far are summarized in Table 3.  Table 3 Table 3 Potential implications of somatic mutations of SF3B1 for molecular diagnosis and prognostication of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms The 2008 WHO diagnostic criteria for MDS are essentially based on morphology (erythroid dysplasia, ring sideroblasts, multilineage dysplasia, and excess of blasts), and include cytogenetics with respect to MDS with del(5q). At present, the most important prognostic factors in MDS are WHO category, cytogenetic abnormality, and transfusion requirement or severity of anemia, all of which are included in the WPSS.16 The degree of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have additional prognostic significance, as shown by the recent study on the revised IPSS (IPSS-R) for MDS.60 Nevertheless, there is a need for more reliable diagnostic and prognostic tools.  The elegant study by Bejar et al has illustrated the clinical effect of point mutations in MDS, in particular the potential of molecular data for facilitating diagnosis, improving prognostication, and allowing the evaluation of disease progression.61 In the next years, targeted gene sequencing is likely to become a frontline diagnostic and prognostic test for MDS, and mutation analysis of SF3B1 should be part of this approach, as suggested in Table 3.  Within MDS/MPN, future diagnostic criteria of RARS-T might include a combination of anemia and thrombocytosis as clinical parameters and a combination of SF3B1 and JAK2 or MPL mutations as molecular parameters.  Finally, several studies are currently being conducted to define the prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations in CLL.  Go to: Spliceosome as a target for therapy Several compounds can modulate mRNA splicing, and a recent review article by Webb et al examines this topic comprehensively.62 Natural products include spliceostatin A,63 pladienolide,64 and meayamycin,38 and small synthetic molecule modulators of splicing factor 3b include sudemycins.65  Spliceosome modulators have antitumor activity in cellular and animal models, and the available evidence indicates that interaction with splicing factor 3b is crucial for their cytotoxic activity.62,64 These compounds likely alter the interaction between splicing factor 3b and pre-mRNA66 and induce abnormal transcription and alternative splicing in mammalian cells.  In the case of hematologic malignancies associated with SF3B1 mutations, the mutant splicing factor 3b causes abnormal transcription and alternative splicing per se. The effect of the above compounds on an abnormal splicing factor is currently unpredictable and preclinical studies are therefore needed to explore the effect of molecule modulators of splicing factor 3b in SF3B1-mutated myeloid or lymphoid cells. The working hypothesis is that cells harboring a spliceosome mutation may be more sensitive to spliceosome modulators.  
512||The tumor suppressor gene p53 has been implicated in the regulation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis by regulating microRNA (miRNA) expression. Here, we report that mutant p53 exerts oncogenic functions and promotes EMT in endometrial cancer (EC) by directly binding to the promoter of miR-130b (a negative regulator of ZEB1) and inhibiting its transcription. We transduced p53 mutants into p53-null EC cells, profiled the miRNA expression by miRNA microarray and identified miR-130b as a potential target of mutant p53. Ectopic expression of p53 mutants repressed the expression of miR-130b and triggered ZEB1-dependent EMT and cancer cell invasion. Loss of an endogenous p53 mutation increased the expression of miR-130b, which resulted in reduced ZEB1 expression and attenuation of the EMT phenotype. Furthermore, re-expression of miR-130b suppressed mutant p53-induced EMT and ZEB1 expression. Importantly, the expression of miR-130 was significantly reduced in EC tissues, and patients with higher expression levels of miR-130b survived longer. These data provide a novel understanding of the roles of p53 gain-of-function mutations in accelerating tumor progression and metastasis through modulation of the miR-130b–ZEB1 axis.  Keywords: EMT, cancer, gain-of-function, miRNA, p53 mutation Go to: Introduction Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a transcriptional process that has a key role in regulating embryonic morphogenesis and cancer metastasis. During EMT, epithelial cells lose their polarization and homotypic cell adhesion, resulting in a more motile, spindle-like morphology with increased invasiveness.1 At the molecular level, EMT occurs as a result of the activity of several transcriptional factors, such as ZEB1/2, Twist, BMI-1, Snail, and Slug, which suppress expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and induce the mesenchymal genes N-cadherin and Vimentin.1 However, the mechanisms and pathways that drive EMT programs are not fully understood.  Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-200 and miR-194/192 family members, have been identified as negative regulators of EMT and metastasis by repressing the expression of ZEB1/2.2 The overexpression of miR-200 and let-7b in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells induces the mesenchymal–epithelial transition, which is the reverse process of EMT.3 Moreover, miR-194 is critical for maintaining the hepatic epithelial cell phenotype and inhibits metastasis by targeting several EMT activator genes.4  Recently, a regulatory connection between p53 signaling and miRNA-mediated EMT has been demonstrated. Wild-type (WT) p53 directly activates the transcription of miR-200c and miR-192 family members, which leads to ZEB1/2 downregulation and repression of EMT.5 Furthermore, mutation of p53 can promote EMT and the aggressive potential of tumor cells by inhibiting WT p53-miR-200c pathways through dominant-negative effects on WT p53.6 However, besides the dominant-negative effects upon WT p53, increasing evidence suggests that p53 mutations acquire additional oncogenic functions, such as a gain-of-function (GOF), which actively drive cells toward invasion and metastasis7 through transactivation or transrepression of a large set of genes involved in regulation of cell adhesion, migration and proliferation.8 In agreement with these findings, previous studies have found that overexpression of miRNAs (miR-181b and miR-200c) is associated with either p53 mutations or shorter patient survival in human colon cancer,9 indicating that mutant p53 may exert GOF activities and promote EMT by modulating miRNAs.  Here, we identified a novel mechanism by which mutant p53 demonstrates GOF effects to facilitate EMT and cancer cell invasion by repressing miR-130b, an inhibitor of ZEB1. We further demonstrated that the expression of miR-130 was significantly reduced in endometrial cancer (EC) tissues, and patients with higher expression levels of miR-130b survived longer. Thus, these data suggest that restoration of miR-130b may have therapeutic value in tumors expressing mutant p53.  Go to: Results Mutant p53 GOF contributes to EMT in EC cells  Although mutant p53 GOF has been shown to promote EMT by upregulating Twist in prostate cancer cells,10 to date, the role of mutant p53 GOF in initiating EMT during EC progression remains unknown. To explore this issue, we used p53-null HEC-50 cells11 stably transduced with vectors encoding p53 mutations R273H, R175H or C135Y, as well as an empty vector. Polyclonal cell lines were generated to omit clonal variation. The p53 protein level was verified using the anti-p53 (DO-7) antibody, which recognizes both WT and mutant p53.  Enforced expression of these p53 mutants induce a shift in cell morphology from a paved stone epithelial appearance to more mesenchymal phenotypes, with loss of cell-to-cell contact and increased cell spreading (Figure 1a). These morphological changes were accompanied by the upregulation of mesenchymal genes, including Twist, ZEB1, BMI-1, Snail, N-cadherin and Vimentin, and decreased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin (Figure 1b). To examine whether overexpression of mutant p53 can promote cell invasion, we next performed a cell invasion assay and observed a significant increase in the invasive capacity of mutant p53-expressing cells compared with empty vector-transfected control cells (Figure 1c). These findings were supported by concomitantly enhanced expression of metastatic-associated genes osteopontin, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in HEC-50 cells containing the p53 mutants (Supplementary Figure S1A).

Recently, EMT has been shown to have critical roles in modulating the cancer stem-like cell phenotype and conferring increased drug resistance of cancer cells.12 To test the roles of mutant p53 GOF in acquiring stemness and drug-resistant properties in EC cells, we investigated the effects of stable expression of mutant p53 R175H on the self-renewal potential of cells using a sphere formation assay. We also assessed the chemosensitizing properties of this cell line after treatment with paclitaxel using the Cell Counting Kit-8. We found that transfection of this mutant, but not empty vector, enabled HEC-50 cells to form floating spheres in a serum-free medium (Figure 1d) and became more resistant to paclitaxel treatment (Figure 1e). To further explore the mechanisms of mutant p53 GOF-mediated cancer stemness and drug resistance, Quantitative reverse transcription (qRT–PCR) was performed to show that the mRNA levels of well-characterized stem cell markers (CD133, KLF4 and NANOG) and chemoresistance-related genes (MDR-1 and MRP-1) was highly enhanced in R175H-expressing cells (Figure 1f).  Similar to the findings obtained from stable transfection experiments, transient transfection of a vector encoding mutant p53 R248Q, but not empty vector, promoted cell invasion (Supplementary Figure S2C). In addition, this mutant also promoted EMT-like changes, including enhanced expression of ZEB1, BMI-1, N-cadherin and Vimentin, as well as repression of E-cadherin in HEC-50 cells (Supplementary Figure S2A). Taken together, these observations suggested a crucial role of mutant p53 GOF in driving EMT and invasive phenotypes of EC cells.  Knockdown of mutant p53 in EC cells causes a reversal of EMT and inhibition of cell invasion ability  To further examine whether loss of endogenous mutant p53 can inhibit EMT features, we performed shRNA-mediated knockdown of mutant p53 in HEC-1 cells, which express endogenous mutant p53 R248Q. Silencing of mutant p53 resulted in significant changes in cell morphology, and the scattered, mesenchymal-like HEC-1 cells began to exhibit a more epithelial-like cobblestone appearance (Figure 2a). Downregulation of this p53 mutant increased the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin and repressed the expression of mesenchymal markers Twist, ZEB1, BMI-1, Snail, N-cadherin and Vimentin (Figure 2b). In agreement with these findings, knockdown of mutant p53 markedly reduced cell invasion (Figure 2c) and reduced the expression of osteopontin, MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Supplementary Figure S1B). To investigate if reduction of mutant p53 expression can suppress cancer stem-like and drug resistance properties, a sphere formation assay and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay were used. We found that HEC-1 cells transfected with p53 shRNA displayed decreased sphere formation (Figure 2d) and were more sensitive to paclitaxel (Figure 2e). These results were supported by qRT–PCR experiments in which the mRNA expression of CD133, KLF4, NANOG, MDR-1 and MRP-1 were significantly attenuated following knockdown of endogenous p53 using shRNA (Figure 2f). Collectively, these results demonstrate that knockdown of mutant p53 can reverse the EMT phenotype and rescue cell invasion of EC cells.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Knockdown of mutant p53 in EC cells causes a reversal of EMT and inhibition of cell invasion ability. (a) Morphology of endometrial cancer HEC-1 cells transfected with control shRNA vector or p53 shRNA vector (scale bar=100 μm). (b) Protein ... ZEB1 is a key downstream mediator in p53 GOF mutant-induced EMT  Previous studies have shown that ZEB1 has a crucial role in the promotion of EMT and cancer stem cell properties in human cancer cells.13 Overexpression of ZEB1 has been detected in aggressive EC.14 Therefore, induction of ZEB1 expression by a p53 GOF mutant and reduction of its expression after mutant p53 silencing allowed us to postulate that ZEB1 may be essential for p53 GOF mutant-induced EMT in EC cells. Transfection of HEC-50 cells with ZEB1 siRNA inhibited mutant p53 R175H-induced BMI-1 and Snail expression, restored E-cadherin expression (Supplementary Figure S3A) and greatly impaired p53 R175H-mediated cell invasion (Supplementary Figure S3B). However, this treatment did not significantly affect the protein level of Twist. Following transfection with ZEB1 siRNA in HEC-1 cells, the mRNA expression of BMI-1 and Snail was suppressed and E-cadherin was elevated (Supplementary Figure S3C). These data indicate that ZEB1 acts as an important downstream effector of these p53 mutants to mediate the EMT process in EC cells.  The p53 GOF mutants contribute to global repression of miRNA expression  To identify miRNAs mediated by the p53 GOF mutants, we performed array-based miRNA profiling of HEC-50 cells transduced with either p53 mutants or empty vector. Of 188 human miRNAs assayed, 23 miRNAs were expressed above background levels. Ectopic overexpression of mutant p53 R273H, R175H and C135Y in HEC-50 cells led to a global downregulation of all these miRNAs (Supplementary Figure S4A). We further validated the microarray results using qRT–PCR (Figure 3b). Notably, the expression of several miRNAs with known tumor suppressor activity, including let-7b,3 miR-143,15 miR-194,16 miR-424,17 miR-451,18 and miR-14619 were significantly reduced in p53-mutant-expressing cells (Supplementary Figure S4B). Thus, these results suggest that global repression of miRNA expression is likely to be a critical mechanism for p53 GOF mutant-enhanced EC tumorigenesis.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Mutant p53 binds to and transrepresses the promoter of miR-130b. (a) Schematic of algorithm used to select candidate microRNAs that potentially target ZEB1, and are negatively regulated by mutant p53s. (b, c) Relative miR-130b expression levels in HEC-50 ... Mutant p53 binds to and transrepresses the promoter of miR-130b  Considering the important roles of ZEB1 in regulating EMT, we next sought to determine whether any of the 23 miRNAs may target ZEB1, and if repression of these miRNAs by mutant p53 may contribute to increased ZEB1 expression in EC cells. We first searched for all predicted miRNA-ZEB1 interactions by using two target-prediction algorithms: TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org) and microRNA.org (http://www.microrna.org), and detected four miRNAs that potentially bind to the 3′ untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of ZEB1 mRNA. We then cross-referenced these four miRNAs with the 23 miRNAs identified by miRNA microarray. We found three miRNAs (miR-130b, miR-301a and miR-301b) that were downregulated in p53-mutant-expressing cells and predicted to bind to ZEB1 3′-UTR (Figure 3a). We selected miR-130b to investigate its effects on EMT and EC cell invasion because transfection of miR-301a and miR-301b did not substantially alter the protein expression of ZEB1 in EC cells (data not shown).  To evaluate whether the p53 mutants (R273H, R175H and C135Y) control the expression of miR-130b, we examined the effects of overexpression of mutant p53 on the expression of miR-130b in HEC-50 cells. The qRT–PCR analysis confirmed a significant decrease in mature miR-130b levels following transfection with the p53 mutants (Figure 3b). Similarly, the p53 mutation R248Q, but not the empty vector, inhibited the expression of miR-130b when expressed transiently (Supplementary Figure S2B). On the other hand, HEC-1 cells transfected with p53 shRNA exhibited a marked elevation in the level of miR-130b (Figure 3c). These results suggest that the endogenous expression of miR-130b is negatively regulated by p53 mutants.  Recent evidence has established an association between p53 and several miRNAs, such as miR-34,20 miR-19221 and miR-200c.5 Transcription of these miRNAs is directly regulated by p53. In particular, several studies have suggested that miR-200c is downregulated in EC tissues,22 and restoration of miR-200c expression in HEC-50 cells decreases cell invasion.23 Using qRT–PCRs to compare miRNA levels in HEC-50 cells, we found that overexpression of mutant p53 R175H and C135Y decrease the expression of miR-200c by 30–20%, whereas mutant R273H has no effects on its expression (Supplementary Figure S5), indicating that downregulation of miR-200c is involved in mutant p53 GOF-induced EC cell invasion.  However, it remains unknown whether p53 mutants function as a transcription regulator of miR-130b. Therefore, we searched for p53-binding sites in the miR-130b promoter using a bioinformatics approach.24 Importantly, we found a conserved p53-binding site (5′-GGGCATGGTGGCTCATGCCT-3′) with a ranking score of 83 (Figure 3d). To determine whether an endogenous p53 mutant can bind this site, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–qPCR analysis was performed on HEC-1 cells. The human telomerase (hTERT) promoter served as a positive control, as it has been previously shown that p53 mutants can bind this promoter.25 Both miR-130b (sixfold) and hTERT (eightfold) promoter sequences were specifically enriched by anti-p53 antibodies, but not by non-specific antibodies (Figure 3e). These data suggest that miR-130b is a direct target of mutant p53 in EC cells.  To assess if the downregulation of miR-130b expression is mediated by transrepression of the p53 mutants, we cloned the p53-binding sequence of the miR-130b promoter upstream of firefly luciferase to yield a WT plasmid pGL3-130b, and further generated mutant pGL3-130b luciferase vectors containing mutations in the candidate p53-binding site. The WT pGL3-130b or mutant pGL3-130b vector was transfected into HEC-50 cells with either a control vector, mutant p53 R175H or WT p53. Interestingly, the luciferase activity of WT pGL3-130b was significantly repressed by R175H, but was transactivated by WT p53. However, expression of mutant p53 or WT p53 did not affect the luciferase activity of mutant pGL3-130b (Figure 3f). Therefore, our observations by qRT–PCR, ChIP–qPCR and the luciferase assay collectively demonstrate that a GOF p53 mutant binds to and transrepresses the miR-130b promoter.  Our results showing a fivefold increase in the ability of WT p53 to transactivate the promoter of miR-130b (Figure 3f, lane 2) raised an interesting possibility that WT p53 controls metastasis through modulation of miR-130b. Therefore, we transiently transfected the WT p53 expression vector into HEC-50 cells (Figure 4a). A qRT–PCR analysis revealed that expression of WT p53 protein significantly induced the levels of miR-130b and also slightly increased the expression of miR-200c (Figure 4b), which is a known target of WT p53.6 In WT p53-expressing HHUA cells, activation of p53 in response to the Mdm2 antagonist Nutlin-3 (Figure 4c) enhanced the level of miR-130b, but this was abolished by the shRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 (Figure 4d). Consistent with an earlier report,6 the knockdown of WT p53 in HHUA cells induced changes associated with EMT, such as a mesenchymal morphology (Figure 4e), low expression of E-cadherin, upregulation of ZEB1 and BMI-1 (Figure 4f), and increased cell invasion (Figure 4g). We also observed an enrichment of WT p53 binding to both the miR-130b and p21 promoters using a ChIP–PCR analysis (Figure 4h). In addition, WT p53 was able to transactivate a pGL-3-miR-130b luciferase reporter gene (Figure 4i). Silencing of p53 by shRNA abrogated Nutlin-3-stimulated luciferase activities of the miR-130b promoter (Figure 4i, compare lane 5 to lanes 7 and 8). These data indicated that mutant and WT p53 exert opposite effects on miR-130b expression, which supports the hypothesis that a p53 GOF mutant contributes to EC carcinogenesis by altering the expression of miR-130b.  Figure 4 Figure 4 WT p53 transactivates the promoter of miR-130b. (a) WT p53 protein level in HEC-50 cells transfected with WT p53 expression vector or control vector. (b) qRT–PCR for miR-130b and miR-200c in HEC-50 cells transfected with WT p53 expression vector ... Despite direct transcriptional regulation by mutant p53, some GOF effects of the p53 mutants may depend on their ability to inactivate p53 family members p63 or p73.26 Furthermore, p63 has been shown to inhibit metastasis through transactivation of miR-130b.27 Therefore, we determined whether p63 inhibition by the p53 mutants is involved in the p53 GOF mutant-induced suppression of miR-130b in HEC-50 cells. We found that downregulation of p63 protein expression by p63 siRNA (Supplementary Figure S6A) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in p21 luciferase activity (Supplementary Figure S6C). As expected, transient transfection of the WT p53 expression vector markedly transactivated the p21 promoter (Supplementary Figure S6C). However, the mRNA expression of miR-130b did not substantially change after p63 knockdown (Supplementary Figure S6B). Thus, p63 inhibition is not likely to be responsible for p53 GOF mutant-induced suppression of miR-130b in EC cells.  miR-130b impairs cell invasion by targeting ZEB1  To investigate whether miR-130b can control EC cell invasion through the modulation of ZEB1 expression, we used TargetScan and miRviewer to search for miRNA-binding sites in the 3'-UTR of ZEB1. The miR-130b was found to possess five evolutionary-conserved binding sites, suggesting that a potential interaction between miR-130b seed region and ZEB1 mRNA 3′-UTR (Figure 5a). To test if miR-130b binds directly to ZEB1 transcript, we transfected biotin-labeled miR-130b into HEC-50 cells, pulled down mRNAs bound to miR-130b and quantified ZEB1 transcript using qRT–PCRs. We found that the levels of ZEB1 mRNA were highly enriched by miR-130b pull-down, as compared with control transcripts of housekeeping genes 5S rRNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Supplementary Figure S7). Real-time PCR and western blot analysis demonstrated that, in HEC-50 cells with high levels of ZEB1, restoration of miR-130b reduced ZEB1 mRNA and protein expression (Figures 5b and c). In contrast, in HEC-1 cells, which express low levels of ZEB1, miR-130b inhibition by transfection with anti-miR-130b increased ZEB1 mRNA and protein levels (Figures 5b and c). These results demonstrate that miR-130b directly interacts with ZEB1 mRNA and represses its expression.  Figure 5 Figure 5 miR-130b impairs cell invasion by targeting ZEB1. (a) Schematic representation of the 3′-UTR of ZEB1 with the predicted target site for miR-130b. Sequence of mature miR-130b reveals the evolutionary conservation of the target site across five ... To assess if miR-130b targets ZEB1 3′-UTR, reporter constructs containing either the WT ZEB1 3′-UTR or ZEB1 3′-UTR with mutation at the predicted miR-130b target sequence were co-transfected into HEC-50 cells together with miR-130b, control miRNA, anti-miR-130b or control anti-miRNA. Transduction of miR-130b caused marked inhibition of the WT ZEB1 3′-UTR, but had no effect on mutant ZEB1 3′-UTR (Figure 5d, compare lane 1 to lanes 2 and 3). In addition, miR-130b inhibition by anti-miR-130b substantially increased luciferase activities of WT ZEB1 3′-UTR compared with control anti-miRNA (Figure 5d, compare lane 4 to lane 5). These data together suggest that miR-130b downregulates ZEB1 expression in EC cells by destabilizing the ZEB1 mRNA as well as translational suppression.  To determine the functional effects of miR-130b-mediated ZEB1 suppression on cell invasion, a cell invasion assay was performed. We found that elevated expression of miR-130b in HEC-50 cells decreased cell invasion, and knockdown of miR-130b by anti-miR-130b in HEC-1 cells enhanced cell invasion (Figure 5e). In agreement with these findings, transfection of miR-130b, but not control miRNA, significantly reduced the mRNA levels of BMI-1, Snail, KLF4, NANOG and MDR-1, and increased mRNA expression of E-cadherin in HEC-50 cells (Figure 5f). Taken together, these results suggest that miR-130b directly targets ZEB1, and as a result reverses EMT-associated EC cell invasion.  The p53 GOF mutants stimulate EMT features through downregulation of miR-130b  To further define the involvement of miR-130b in mutant p53-stimulated ZEB1 expression and EMT characteristics, miR-130b was transfected into mutant p53 R175H-expressing HEC-50 cells. Reintroduction of miR-130b abolished the mRNA expression of ZEB1, Snail, BMI-1, KLF4 and NANOG, restored E-cadherin expression and markedly diminished p53R175H-induced cell invasion (Figures 6a and b). To further confirm these results, we used HEC-1 cells expressing shRNA against p53 or control cells to show that transfection with anti-miR-130b was capable of restoring the mRNA levels of ZEB1, Snail, BMI-1, KLF4 and NANOG, as well as decrease the expression of E-cadherin and initiate sphere formation (Figures 6c and d). These data demonstrate that a p53 GOF mutant downregulates miR-130b expression, which results in activation of ZEB1, and its downstream pathway and contributes to the induction of EMT and increased EC cell invasion.  Figure 6 Figure 6 The p53 GOF mutants stimulate EMT features through downregulation of miR-130b.

Clinical association of miR-130b expression with prognosis of EC patients  The expression of miR-130 was significantly reduced (P=0.02) in EC tissues (Figure 7a). Moreover, patients with higher expression levels of miR-130b survived longer (P=0.05) than patients with lower expression levels (Figure 7b).

Go to: Discussion In this study, we have demonstrated that a GOF p53 mutant can induce EMT and increase invasive properties in EC cells by regulating a large set of EMT-associated genes. More importantly, we provide an underlying mechanism for p53 GOF-enhanced metastasis: mutant p53 can bind directly and transrepress the promoter of miR-130b, which is a specific inhibitor of ZEB1, leading to the upregulation of ZEB1 and subsequent activation of the E-cadherin suppressors BMI-1 and Snail (Figure 8). Notably, the effects of mutant p53 on EMT features and cell invasion can be partly abolished by restoration of miR-130b expression. Therefore, re-expression of miR-130b may inhibit tumor metastasis and progression, providing a potential therapeutic use in patients with EC.  Figure 8 Figure 8 Schematic model indicating proposed mechanisms by which mutant p53 GOF induces EMT. Mutant p53 GOF induces EMT, through direct transrepression of miR-130b, an inhibitor of ZEB1, and subsequent activation of ZEB1-dependent signaling pathway. Although upregulation of some miRNAs is reported in different tumors,28 the widespread reduction of miRNA expression has been observed in a range of tumor types and is associated with increased metastatic activity.29, 30 Our findings suggest that the principal consequence of a p53 GOF mutant on miRNA expression is global repression. Thus, the correlation between a p53 GOF mutant and general repression of miRNAs suggests that the overall repression of miRNAs, especially those miRNAs with tumor suppressor function, is involved in p53 GOF mutant-stimulated EC metastasis and progression.  Several reports showed that p53 mutations not only target a set of genes that are different from those controlled by WT p53 such as c-myc,31 but also differently modulate WT p53-target genes.32, 33, 34 Mechanistically, the transcriptional effects of mutant p53 on WT p53-dependent promoters are mediated by at least four types of molecular interactions: (1) mutant p53 binds to WT p53-target gene promoters in the region distinct from WT p53 response elements.35 (2) However, ChIP analysis reveals that mutant p53 physically associates with several promoters, such as EGR136 and MSP/MST-1,37 which also interact with WT p53. (3) There is increasing evidence that both WT and mutant p53 can form a complex with sequence-specific transcription factors (Sp1,38, 39 NF-Y,40, 41 or other factors), and be recruited to binding sites of those factors on chromatin, and modulate their transcriptional activities. (4) In addition, p53 mutants can display the WT p53 conformation due to a shift in the conformational equilibrium,42 and thereby bind to the consensus sequence.43 Our data indicate that both mutant p53 and WT p53 are present on the miR-130b promoter to regulate its expression, which is consistent with the reported finding of mutant p53. Future studies will be required to identify the transcriptional factors that specifically interact with mutant p53 and clarify the biological significance of their physical interaction.  Previous studies have shown that miR-130b is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma44 and aggressive papillary thyroid carcinoma.45 Furthermore, downregulation of miR-130b confers a multidrug-resistant phenotype in ovarian cancer cells.46 However, other reports also suggest that overexpression of miR-130b in CD133 (+) liver tumor-initiating cells increased their self-renewal capacity and chemoresistance.47 We found that the transcriptional inactivation of miR-130b by mutant p53 is required for p53 GOF mutant-mediated EMT and invasive phenotypes in EC cells. These results suggest that miR-130b may have a dual function as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene, depending on the cancer type and cellular context.  The HEC-50 cell line (p53 null) was derived from a patient with invasive grade 3 EC. Thus, the inverse relationship between miR-130b and mutant p53 expression observed in these cells, which is a genetic alteration frequently found in aggressive EC, suggests that miR-130b expression is likely reduced in later stages of tumor progression when mutant p53 becomes the main driver of invasion and metastasis.  Some evidence has suggested that miR-194 is a WT p53-responsive miRNA with potent anti-proliferative activity.48 Interestingly, we have recently shown that miR-194 is able to inhibit EMT and cell invasion of EC cells by targeting oncogene BMI-1.16 Our present study suggests that the expression of miR-194 is negatively regulated by mutant p53 in EC cells. The significance and clinical relevance of miR-130b were further demonstrated in EC patients (Figure 7). Therefore, we postulate that p53 mutations induce EMT and promote EC metastasis, at least in part, through regulating both miR-130b/ZEB1 and miR-194/BMI-1 signaling pathways (Figure 8). Our results open a possibility that multiple molecular mechanisms with different miRNAs are involved in p53 GOF mutant-dependent EMT programming. Further research is clearly needed to understand the mechanisms of p53 mutant-mediated EMT induction and the functional cross-talk between p53 signal pathways and miRNA-modulated gene expression profiles.  
1081||EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, catalyzes the mono- through trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27). Histone H3K27 trimethylation is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification. Point mutations of the EZH2 gene (Tyr641) have been reported to be linked to subsets of human B-cell lymphoma. The mutant allele is always found associated with a wild-type allele (heterozygous) in disease cells, and the mutations were reported to ablate the enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex for methylating an unmodified peptide substrate. Here we demonstrate that the WT enzyme displays greatest catalytic efficiency (kcat/K) for the zero to monomethylation reaction of H3K27 and diminished efficiency for subsequent (mono- to di- and di- to trimethylation) reactions. In stark contrast, the disease-associated Y641 mutations display very limited ability to perform the first methylation reaction, but have enhanced catalytic efficiency for the subsequent reactions, relative to the WT enzyme. These results imply that the malignant phenotype of disease requires the combined activities of a H3K27 monomethylating enzyme (PRC2 containing WT EZH2 or EZH1) together with the mutant PRC2s for augmented conversion of H3K27 to the trimethylated form. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a human disease that is dependent on the coordinated activities of normal and disease-associated mutant enzymatic function.  Keywords: cancer, enzymology, epigenetics Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a 4 or 5 protein complex that functionally represses gene transcription via posttranslational modification of the chromatin core protein, histone H3. More specifically, PRC2 functions as a histone methyltransferase, catalyzing the selective methylation of lysine residue 27 on histone H3 (H3K27). EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, catalyzing the mono- through trimethylation of H3K27. Trimethylation of H3K27 is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification.  Recently, somatic mutations of Tyr641 (Y641F, Y641N, Y641S, and Y641H) of EZH2 were reported to be associated with follicular lymphoma (FL) and the germinal-center B-cell like (GCB) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (1). In all cases, occurrence of the mutant EZH2 gene was heterozygous, and expression of both WT and mutant alleles was detected in the mutant samples profiled by transcriptome sequencing. It was also demonstrated that all of the mutant forms of EZH2 could be incorporated into the multiprotein PRC2 complex, but that the resulting complexes lacked the ability to catalyze methylation of the H3K27 equivalent residue of a peptidic substrate. Hence, it was concluded that the disease-associated changes at Tyr641 resulted in loss of function with respect to EZH2-catalyzed H3K27 methylation.  A presumptive reduction in the rate of H3K27 methylation due to enzyme heterozygosity seemed to us to be difficult to rationalize as the basis for a malignant phenotype (1, 2), especially in light of previous data indicating that overexpression of EZH2 (3–6), loss-of-function mutations in the corresponding H3K27 demethylase UTX (7), or overexpression of components of the PRC2, such as PHF19/PCL3 involved in increased H3K27 trimethylation (8–10), all result in malignant phenotypes in specific human cancers. Several recent reports indicate that an important component of early lymphomagenesis is the acquisition of stem cell-like characteristics (11, 12). Among these characteristics is enriched DNA methylation of PRC2 target genes, resulting in diminished transcription of these genes (13). Trimethylation of H3K27, catalyzed by the enzymatic activity of EZH2, similarly leads to diminished transcription of these same genes and has thus been reported as an additional, potential progenitor of lymphomagenesis (11–14). EZH2 levels have also directly been implicated in lymphogenesis. For example, Velichutina et al. (14) found that EZH2 mRNA level was directly correlated with cellular proliferation in primary germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tumors, whereas levels of many EZH2 target genes were negatively correlated with proliferation in these same tumors. Likewise, expression levels of EZH2 and the PRC1 component BMI1 have both been linked to lymphogenesis and the degree of malignancy of B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas (15). We were thus motivated to explore the enzymology of the EZH2 mutants in greater detail.  Go to: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Recombinant PRC2 complexes (16) were prepared with WT and Tyr641 mutant versions of human EZH2 (see Materials and Methods). Equal concentrations (nominally 8 nM, based on protein determinations) of each complex were initially tested for the ability to catalyze 3H-methyl transfer from labeled SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) to an unmodified peptide representing the amino acid sequence surrounding H3K27 (H3:21-44) or to native avian erythrocyte oligonucleosomes. As previously reported (1), we found that the WT enzyme displayed robust activity for methyl transfer to this peptidic substrate, but that none of the mutant enzymes displayed significant methyltransferase activity (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the previously reported data and that in Fig. 1A, we found that all of the mutant EZH2 constructs were active methyltransferases against the avian nucleosome substrate (Fig. 1B).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. B-cell lymphoma-associated mutants of EZH2 are active histone methyltransferases. In vitro methyltransferase activity of PRC2 complexes containing wild-type and various Y641 mutants of EZH2 was measured as (A) methyl transfer reactions using a peptide ... There are several potential explanations for the discordant activity of the mutant PRC2 complexes on peptide and nucleosome substrates. One possibility is that substrate recognition sites distal to the enzyme active site (i.e., exosites) are important determinants of substrate binding and turnover; these sites would engage complementary recognition elements on the nucelosome that are not available on small peptidic substrates. However, when Escherichia coli-expressed, recombinant human histone H3 was tested as a substrate for the WT and mutant PRC2 complexes, the resulting pattern of activity was identical to that seen for the peptide substrate (see Supporting Information); that is, the WT enzyme demonstrated robust methyltransferase activity against the H3 substrate, the Y641F mutant showed 7% the activity of WT complex, and all other mutants displayed ≤ 1% the activity of WT complex. Hence, exosite engagement seems an unlikely explanation for the current results. The nucleosome presents many lysine residues beyond H3K27 as potential sites of methylation that would not be present in the small peptidic substrate. Thus, another possibility is that mutation of Y641 alters the substrate specificity of EZH2 to result in methylation of lysine residues other than H3K27. This possibility is unlikely given the excellent agreement between mutant activity on small peptide and recombinant H3 protein substrates. To evaluate this possibility further, we tested the enzymatic activity of the WT and mutant PRC2 complexes against a panel of peptidic substrates that represent all possible lysine residues of histone H3 and histone H4 (see Materials and Methods). All of the enzyme forms showed significant activity only against peptides containing the equivalent of residue H3K27. The specific activity of the mutants, however, was greatly reduced relative to WT in the order WT≫Y641F > Y641S ∼ Y641H > Y641N, again consistent with previous reported findings. The nucleosomes isolated from the avian natural source represent an admixture of states of histone modification, including various states of H3K27 methylations as judged by Western blotting with H3K27 methylation specific antibodies. Hence, another possibility is that the Y641 mutants of EZH2 display differential activity against different methylation states of H3K27.  To understand further the enzymatic activity of these mutants, and to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between activity against peptidic and nucleosome substrates, we studied the ability of the enzyme forms to catalyze further methylation of various H3K27 methylation states in the context of the H3:21-44 peptide. As stated above, we found that all of the mutant enzymes were deficient catalysts of unmodified H3K27 peptide methylation, relative to the WT enzyme. To our surprise, however, all of the mutant enzymes were superior to the WT enzyme in catalyzing further methylation of the mono- and especially the dimethylated H3K27 peptides (Fig. 2). Thus, the data suggest that the WT enzyme is most efficient in catalyzing the zero to monomethylation reaction. The mutant enzymes are defective in catalyzing this initial step, but are more efficient than the WT enzyme in catalyzing the subsequent steps leading from monomethyl to di- and trimethyl H3K27.  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. PRC2 complexes containing mutant EZH2 preferentially catalyze di- and trimethylation of histone H3K27. (A) Methyltransferase activity of mutant and WT complexes on unmethylated peptide (open bars), monomethylated peptide (hatched bars), and dimethylated ... The origins of the differential substrate specificities of WT and mutant EZH2 were explored through steady-state enzyme kinetics. As summarized in Table 1, the mutations have minimal effects on ground-state substrate recognition, as demonstrated by the similar values of Km for nucleosome and of K1/2 for peptide substrates. In all cases the peptidic substrates displayed sigmoidal binding behavior; hence, the concentration of peptide resulting in half-maximal velocity is reported here as K1/2 instead of the more common Michaelis constant, Km (17). This sigmoidal behavior was seen only with peptidic substrates (i.e., nucleosome and recombinant histone substrates displayed classical Michaelis–Menten kinetics), and the origin of this effect is unclear at present. The SAM Km likewise displayed minimal variation among the enzyme forms, ranging from 208 ± 50 to 304 ± 64 nM. Instead, the differences in substrate utilization appear to have their origin in transition state recognition, as demonstrated by differences in kcat values among the enzymes for various substrates (Table 1); as a result, the catalytic efficiency, quantified as the ratio kcat/K (where K is either Km or K1/2, depending on substrate identity; see above), varies between the WT and mutant enzymes for different states of H3K27 methylation (Table 1).  Table 1. Table 1. Steady-state kinetic parameters for methylation reactions catalyzed by PRC2 containing wild-type or Y641 mutants of EZH2 The mutation of Y641 to F, N, H, or S in EZH2 may facilitate multiple rounds of H3K27 methylation by impacting the H-bonding pattern and/or steric crowding in the active site of the enzyme–bisubstrate ternary complex, affecting the formation of a proper water channel for deprotonation of the reacting lysine (18). This inference is drawn by analogy to the crystallographic and molecular dynamic simulation results seen for tyrosine mutation in the related protein lysine methyltransferases LSMT, Dim-5, and SET7/9. For example, when tyrosine 245 of recombinant SET7/9 was mutated to alanine, a change in substrate specificity, similar to what is reported here for EZH2 Y641 mutations, was observed (19). The ability of the Y245A mutant SET7/9 to methylate an unmodified 20-residue peptide, representing the sequence surrounding H3K4, was reduced to ca. 20% of the WT enzyme (20). At the same time, the ability of the Y245A mutant to further methylate H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 peptides was greatly augmented (ca. 7-fold and 5-fold, respectively) relative to the WT enzyme. In contrast to the present results, however, mutation of SET7/9 Y245 to phenylalanine did not enhance mono- to dimethylation nor di- to trimethylation of the peptide; rather, the Y245F mutant displayed minimal catalytic activity for all peptidic substrates. Similarly, the wild-type enzyme G9a can dimethylate H3K9 but is unable to perform the di- to trimethylation reaction. Yet, when tyrosine 1067 of G9a (analogous to Y641 of EZH2) is mutated to phenylalanine, the enzyme now gains the ability to trimethylate H3K9 (21). The tolerance for multiple Y641 mutations in EZH2 suggests that a release of steric crowding may allow greater access for proper alignment of the larger dimethyl lysine as the substrate for the di- to trimethylation reaction. Crystallographic analysis of the protein methyltransferases SET7/9 and G9a reveals that the side chain hydroxyls of the active site tyrosine residues are involved in H-bonding interactions directly with the amine of the methyl-accepting lysine, or indirectly through an intervening water molecule. Although the larger active site of the Y641 mutants is favorable for di- and trimethylation, the loss of the tyrosine hydroxyl hydrogen bond acceptor may result in an unfavorable orientation of the active site for initial methyl transfer to the lysine amine. A complete understanding of the molecular basis for the dramatic reduction in the ability of these mutant enzymes to perform the initial methylation reaction will require additional study.  The implications of the present results for human disease are made clear by the data summarized in Table 1. Cells heterozygous for EZH2 would be expected to display a malignant phenotype, due to the efficient formation of H3K27me1 by the WT enzyme and the efficient, subsequent transition of this progenitor species to abnormally high levels of H3K27me3 by the mutant enzyme form(s). We note that H3K27me1 formation is not exclusively dependent on WT-EZH2 catalysis. Knockout studies of EZH2 and of another PRC2 subunit, EED, have demonstrated H3K27me1 formation can be catalyzed by PRC2 complexes containing either EZH2 or the related protein EZH1, as the catalytic subunit (22). Hence, catalytic coupling between the mutant EZH2 species and PRC2 complexes containing either WT-EZH2 or WT-EZH1 would suffice to augment H3K27me3 formation and thus produce the attendant malignant phenotype. Our data therefore suggest that the malignant phenotype of FL and DLBCL of the GCB subtype, associated with expression of mutant forms of EZH2 (1), is the result of an overall gain of function with respect to formation of the trimethylated form of H3K27.  The steady-state kinetic parameters listed in Table 1 allow us to calculate the expected levels of different H3K27 methylation states for cells heterozygous for the various mutant EZH2 forms, relative to cells homozygous for the WT enzyme. To perform these simulations we made a number of simplifying assumptions: (i) that steady-state enzyme kinetics are relevant to PRC2-catalyzed H3K27 methylation in the cellular context and that all measurements are made at the same time point in cell growth; (ii) that the mutant and the WT enzyme are expressed at equal levels in heterozygous cells and that the total EZH2 level is equal in all cells; (iii) that the cellular concentration of SAM, relative to its Km, is saturating and does not change among the cells; (iv) that the cellular concentration of nucleosome is similar to its Km and likewise does not change among cells; (v) that EZH1 catalyzed methylation of H3K27 was insignificant and constant among the cells; and (vi) that any H3K27 demethylase activity was also constant among the cells. With these assumptions in place, we obtained the predictions illustrated in Fig. 3A for relative levels of H3K27me3 (Top), H3K27me2 (Middle), and H3K27me1 (Bottom). A clear pattern emerges from these simulations. The level of H3K27me3 increases relative to WT cells for all mutant-harboring cells, ranging from a 30% increase for the Y641H mutant to > 400% for the Y641N mutant. At the same time, the levels of H3K27me2 decrease to < 50% of WT for all of the mutants, and the levels of H3K27me1 are reduced by approximately half for all mutants, relative to WT. We then measured the relative levels of the H3K27 methylation states in B-cell lymphoma cell lines that are known to be homozygous for WT EZH2 (OCI-LY19) or heterozygous for EZH2 Y641N (DB, KARPAS 422, and SU-DHL-6) or EZH2 Y641F (WSU-DLCL2) by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). The pattern of relative H3K27 methylation states seen in Fig. 3B is in excellent agreement with the results of the simulations based on in vitro steady-state kinetic parameters, despite the crude assumptions used in the simulations and the use of a nonphysiological peptide surrogate as substrate. Thus, we observe increased H3K27me3 for all mutant-harboring cells relative to WT, decreased H3K27me2 for all mutant-harboring cells relative to WT, and decreased H3K27me1 for at least two of the four mutant cell lines. The near-comparable levels of H3K27me1 in WT and KARPAS 422 and SU-DHL-6 cells may reflect different expression levels of WT and mutant EZH2, different contributions of EZH1, or other factors not accounted for in our simulations. Nevertheless, the concordance between the predicted and experimental patterns of H3K27 methylation status is remarkable and supports our view that enzymatic coupling between WT and mutant EZH2 leads to increased H3K27me3, thus resulting in the malignant phenotype of cells that are heterozygous for these mutants.  Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Steady-state enzyme kinetics predicts the relative patterns of H3K27 methylation status in EZH2 WT and heterozygous mutant lymphoma cell lines. (A) Predicted relative levels of H3K27me3 (Top), H3K27me2 (Middle), and H3K27me1 (Bottom) for cells containing ... The foregoing interpretation of our data also helps to reconcile the existence of cancer-associated overexpression of EZH2 (3–6) or PRC2-associated proteins (e.g., PHF19/PCL3) (8–10) and also loss-of-function genotypes for the histone H3K27 demethylase UTX (7). Loss of UTX activity would be enzymatically equivalent to a gain of function for EZH2, in either situation resulting in greater steady-state levels of trimethylated H3K27 in cancer cells (Fig. 4). The mono-, di-, and trimethylation states of histone H3K27 are associated with different functions in transcriptional control. Histone H3K27 monomethylation is associated with active transcription of genes that are poised for transcription (23, 24). In contrast, trimethylation of histone H3K27 is associated with either transcriptionally repressed genes (23, 25) or genes that are poised for transcription when histone H3K4 trimethylation is in cis (26). Taken together, alterations in the PRC2 complex activity reported in cancer, including the Y641 mutation of EZH2, are predicted to result in an increase in the trimethylated state of histone H3K27 and to thus result in transcriptional repression.  Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Proposed mechanisms leading to aberrantly high levels of trimethylation on histone H3K27 in cancer include (A) mutation of Y641 in EZH2 resulting in a change in substrate preference from the nonmethylated to the mono- and dimethylated histone H3K27, ( ... EZH2 and other protein methyltransferases have been suggested to be attractive targets for drug discovery (27–29). The present data also suggest an experimental strategy for development of FL and GCB lymphoma-specific drugs. As the differences in substrate recognition between the WT and disease-associated mutants derive from transition state interactions, small molecule inhibitors that selectively mimic the transition state of the mutant EZH2 over that of the WT enzyme should prove to be effective in blocking H3K27 methylation in mutation-bearing cells. Inhibitors of this type would be expected to display a large therapeutic index, as target-mediated toxicity would be minimal for any cells bearing only the WT enzyme. Transition state mimicry has proved to be an effective strategy for drug design in many disease areas (17, 30). Whether or not sufficient differentiation between the transition states of the WT and mutant EZH2 enzymes can be designed into a small molecule drug remains to be determined.  In summary, the present results point to a critical dependency on enzymatic coupling between enzymes that perform H3K27 monomethylation and the mutant forms of EZH2, for pathogenesis in FL and the GCB subtype of DLBCL. This is an example of a human disease that is dependent on such coupling of catalytic activity between normal (H3K27me1) and disease-associated mutant (H3K27me2/3) enzymes. We are unaware of other examples of this mechanism of pathogenesis in human disease.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Recombinant 5-Component PRC2. Wild-type EZH2 (NM_004456) or Tyr641 mutants were coexpressed with wild-type AEBP2 (NM_153207), EED (NM_003797), SUZ12 (NM_015355), and RbAp48 (NM_005610) in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using a baculovirus expression system. An N-terminal FLAG tag on the EED was used to purify active PRC2 complex from cell lysates (BPS Bioscience, catalog number 51004). The purity of the final PRC2 preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining.  Recombinant Human Histone H3. Recombinant human histone H3.1, expressed in and purified from E. coli (catalog number M250S) was purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc.  H3, H4 Peptide Panel. A library consisting of 44 peptides of 15 amino acids each was synthesized by 21st Century Biochemicals. This peptide panel encompassed all of the amino acids of human histones H3 and H4 with 10 residue overlaps between consecutive peptide sequences. The N terminus of each peptide was appended with biotin, and the C termini were represented as the amide. Purity (> 95%) and identity were confirmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectral analysis.  For study of the H3K27 methylation status dependence of enzyme activity, peptides were synthesized representing the amino acid sequence of human H3 from residues 21–44 (H3:21–44) with lysine 27 represented as the unmodified, monomethylated, dimethylated, or trimethylated side chain amine. These peptides were purchased from New England Peptide with biotin appended to the C terminus of each peptide.  In Vitro Assays of PRC2 Methyltransferase Activity. Flashplate assay with peptide substrate. For initial comparison of WT and Y641 mutants of EZH2, biotinylated histone H3:21-44 peptide containing unmethylated K27 (New England Peptide), monomethylated K27 (Millipore), or dimethylated K27 (Millipore) at a concentration of 800 nM was combined with a mixture of SAM at 1,700 nM, and 300 nM tritiated SAM (PerkinElmer, Inc.). This substrate combination was then added to the PRC2 in assay buffer [20 mM N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine (Bicine), 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween20, 0.005% bovine skin gelatin (BSG), pH 7.6]. Reactions were allowed to proceed for the indicated time interval and then quenched by addition of excess cold SAM (600-μM final concentration). Quenched reaction mixtures were transferred to a streptavidin-coated Flashplate (PerkinElmer, catalog number SMP410), allowed to bind for 1 h, and then detected on a TopCount NXT HTS (PerkinElmer). Each time point represents the average of six individual reactions. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined under identical reaction conditions except that the concentration of peptide or SAM was varied, while at saturating conditions of the other substrate. Velocity was plotted as a function of varied substrate concentration and the data were fitted to the untransformed version of the Michaelis–Menten equation or the untransformed version of a sigmoidal kinetic equation (30) to calculate values of K and kcat (30). Standard errors of fitted parameters are listed in Table 1 and were used to construct the error bars illustrated in Fig. 2 B and C. Errors associated with kcat/K (Table 1) were calculated according to standard methods of error propogation; the fractional error of kcat/K was determined as  equation image	[1] where μkcat is the standard error of kcat and μK is the standard error of K.  Filterplate assay with histone and oligonucleosome. Chicken erythrocyte oligonucleosomes were purified as previously described (31). Nucleosomes or histones were combined with a mixture of SAM and tritiated SAM and added to PRC2 in assay buffer (20 mM Bicine, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween20, 0.005% BSG, pH 7.6). Reactions were run and quenched as above. Quenched reaction mixture was transferred to a glass fiber filterplate (Millipore, catalog number MSFBN6B) and washed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid and allowed to dry. Microscint Zero (30 μL) was added and tritium incorporation was detected on a TopCount. Steady-state parameters for reactions with nucelosomes were determined under identical reaction conditions except that the concentration of nucleosome or SAM was varied while at saturating conditions of the other substrate. Velocity was plotted as a function of varied substrate concentration and fitted to the untransformed version of the Michaelis–Menten equation to derive the values of Km and kcat as described above.  Evaluation of H3K27 methylation status in cells. The cell lines OCI-LY19 (ACC 528), KARPAS-422 (ACC 32), and WSU-DLCL2 (ACC 575) were obtained from DSMZ. The cell lines DB (CRL-2289) and SU-DHL2 (CRL-2959) were obtained from ATCC. OCI-LY19, WSU-DLCL2, and DB cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, and KARPAS-422 and SU-DHL2 cell lines were grown in RPMI medium 1640 plus 20% FBS. Cells were grown to a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/mL and 1 × 107 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 264  × g, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed by resuspension in a 10× pellet volume of RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, and 1mM EDTA (Millipore #20-188), plus 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche # 1836153). Lysates were sonicated by two rounds of ten 1-s bursts at setting 3 with a Misonix XL-2000 to ensure efficient histone extraction, and cleared by centrifugation at 4° using a bench top centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Four micrograms of each lysate was fractionated on 4–20% Tris-Glycine gel (Invitrogen), transferred to PVDF, and probed with the following antibodies in Odyssey blocking buffer: mouse anti-EZH2 (CST 3147; 1∶2,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (CST 9733; 1∶10,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me2 (CST 9755; 1∶5,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me1 (Active Motif 39377; 1∶5,000 dilution), and mouse antiTotal H3 (CST 3638; 1∶20,000 dilution). Following primary Ab incubation, membranes were probed with IRDye 800CW donkey-anti-mouse IgG (LiCOR #926-32212) or Alexa Fluor 680 goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen #A-21076) secondary Ab and imaged using the LiCOR Odyssey system.  Next-generation sequencing of follicular lymphoma and diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma has revealed frequent somatic, heterozygous Y641 mutations in the histone methyltransferase EZH2. Heterozygosity and the presence of equal quantities of both mutant and wild-type mRNA and expressed protein suggest a dominant mode of action. Surprisingly, B-cell lymphoma cell lines and lymphoma samples harboring heterozygous EZH2Y641 mutations have increased levels of histone H3 Lys-27–specific trimethylation (H3K27me3). Expression of EZH2Y641F/N mutants in cells with EZH2WT resulted in an increase of H3K27me3 levels in vivo. Structural modeling of EZH2Y641 mutants suggests a “Tyr/Phe switch” model whereby structurally neutral, nontyrosine residues at position 641 would decrease affinity for unmethylated and monomethylated H3K27 substrates and potentially favor trimethylation. We demonstrate, using in vitro enzyme assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, that Y641 mutations result in a decrease in monomethylation and an increase in trimethylation activity of the enzyme relative to the wild-type enzyme. This represents the first example of a disease-associated gain-of-function mutation in a histone methyltransferase, whereby somatic EZH2 Y641 mutations in lymphoma act dominantly to increase, rather than decrease, histone methylation. The dominant mode of action suggests that allele-specific EZH2 inhibitors should be a future therapeutic strategy for this disease.  Go to: Introduction Non-Hodgkin lymphomas represent a diverse spectrum of distinct entities with the 2 most common types represented by follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). There are 2 molecular subtypes of DLBCL based on cell-of-origin distinctions: the activated B-cell type and the germinal center B-cell (GCB) type. Both follicular lymphoma and the GCB subtype of DLBCL derive from germinal center B cells. We have shown that, in 7% of follicular lymphomas and 22% of GCB-type DLBCL, a single point mutation in EZH2, which results in a single amino-acid change at position 641, is selected for; EZH2 (Tyr641 or WT) was mutated to phenylalanine (Y641F), asparagine (Y641N), histidine (Y641H), or serine (Y641S).1 EZH2 has been implicated as an oncoprotein often overexpressed in many solid tumors.2–4 Initial analysis of the activity of Y641 variants in cell-free reconstituted Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) complexes using unmethylated peptides suggested that the mutations behaved as a loss of function.1  EZH2 is the catalytic member of the PRC2; however, EZH2 alone has very weak histone-methylating activity. Other members of the PRC2 complex include EED, SUZ12, AEBP2, and RbAp48 and are required for full activity. The PRC2 complex has been shown to exhibit in vitro enzyme activity on histone peptide substrates and nucleosomes. EZH2 is a member of the Su(var)3,9, enhancer of zest, Trithorax (SET) domain containing family of histone methyltransferases (HMTases); all contain a conserved SET domain. Genetic and biochemical analysis of EZH2 SET domain has revealed their histone methyltransferase function associated with histone H3 Lys-27–specific trimethylation (H3K27me3) in vivo. Recently, a structural basis for the allosteric modulation of EZH2 activity by EED has been elucidated.5  Structural and biochemical data from other SET domain HMTases have shed light not only on the molecular mechanism of histone methylation but also the specific residues of the conserved SET domain responsible for these reactions. For example, all active HMTases contain a catalytic triad—the asparagine-histidine-serine (NHS) motif,6 and mutation of any one of these residues in the active site abolishes the activity of the enzyme. Studies have also implicated residues important for the binding of the S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)7 and for recognition of the amino-acid sequence of the histone peptide tail.8 However, these studies have not shed light on the role of the highly evolutionarily conserved Tyr 641 of EZH2.  Through the use of molecular modeling and recently published molecular and biochemical data from an allelic series of G9a9 and by analogy to the “Tyr/Phe” switch alleles in other methyltransferases,10,11 we show that Tyr 641 of EZH2 is implicated in substrate and product specificity. Taken together with the finding that DLBCL cell lines heterozygous for EZH2 mutants exhibit higher steady-state levels of H3K27me3 and in vitro enzyme studies, a possible mechanism may be proposed. This report provides evidence that EZH2 Y641 mutant protein-containing PRC2 complexes exhibit increased activity on dimethylated peptides compared with wild-type containing PRC2 complexes, thereby shifting the steady state of H3K27 to favor trimethylation in vivo. As previously described, the EZH2 mutant-containing PRC2 complexes are inactive on unmethylated histone peptides,1 implying that the Y641F/N mutations can only act in the presence of a wild-type EZH2.

Plasmids. pDONR223 human EZH2 was from the human ORFeome collection.12 Point mutations were made to generate EZH2Y641F and EZH2Y641N. These ORFs were then transferred into pcDNA6.2 GFP-V5 (Invitrogen) using the LR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmids containing mouse Ezh2, pCMV FLAG-Ezh2WT, and FLAG-Ezh2H689A were gifts from D.

The purity for each peptide was assessed using mass spectrometry to be more than 95% (data not shown) and identity confirmed by dot blotting (supplemental Figure 3).  Clinical samples. Snap-frozen initial diagnostic lymph node biopsies with a confirmed diagnosis of DLBCL were studied. In total, 10 cases were analyzed by Western blotting, including 5 cases with confirmed wild-type EZH2 and 5 mutant cases. All cases were identified by whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing, and the DNA status then confirmed by Sanger sequencing.9 Informed consent for these studies was obtained for all patients together with research ethics approval in accordance with the British Columbia Cancer Agency policy and the Declaration of Helsinki.  Cell lines and transfection  DLBCL cell lines harboring EZH2WT or heterozygous for EZH2Y641F or EZH2Y641N (imported from the DSMZ; www.dsmz.de) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells (150 000 cells per well of a 6-well plate) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or TransIT−LT1 (Mirus) with 1 to 5 μg of plasmids. Stable cell lines were made by transfection of HEK293T cells with the respective plasmids and then selection with blasticidine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 week. Pools of stable lines expressing GFP-alone or GFP-tagged proteins were used for the experiments.  Western blotting and immunoprecipitation  Standard methods of Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were used; details are in the supplemental data. Densitometry measurements of bands were used to calculate H3K27me3/totalH3 by integrating each peak in ImageJ (1.44n, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij) software.  Large-scale immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry  A total of 3 × 108 cells from the WSU-DLCL2 and DOHH2 cell lines were harvested, and nuclear lysates were prepared as described in the supplemental data. For large-scale immunoprecipitations, 160 mg of nuclear lysates was diluted with binding buffer and precleared with Sepharose 4B for 1 hour at 4°C. EZH2 complexes were immunoprecipitated with 30 μg of anti-EZH2 antibody (#612667, BD Biosciences) by rotating overnight at 4°C. Antibody-bound protein complexes were then incubated with 120 μL of Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 4°C. Bound EZH2 complexes were washed 5 times with 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 30 μL of sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading dye. Samples were resolved using a 4% to 12% gradient gel (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and stained with colloidal Coomassie stain. After destaining, the gel was cut into 16 slices per lane corresponding to a specific molecular weight range. In-gel trypsin digestion was performed, and peptides were extracted from the gel using standard protocols.16  High-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry (MS) was performed on a 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/Sciex) coupled to an Agilent 1100 Nano-HPLC (Agilent Technologies) using a nano-electrospray interface, as described in supplemental data.  Histone methyltransferase assay  Similar batches of recombinant reconstituted active PRC2 complexes as used previously1 containing EZH2WT(51 004), EZH2Y641N, or EZH2Y641F were purchased from BPS Biosciences. Methyltransferase assays were performed using a kit (#17-330, Millipore) as per the manufacturer's instructions, except that biotinylated peptides were used as substrates; 250 ng of active PRC2 complex was incubated with 0.67μM 3H-SAM (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences), 1μM biotinylated peptide in 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 0.5mM dithiothreitol for 30 minutes at 30°C in a 10-μL volume. A total of 5 μL was spotted on a P81 square paper (Millipore), washed (twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid and once with 100% ethanol) to remove unincorporated SAM, air-dried, and placed in a glass scintillation vial with 5 mL of scintillation fluid (ScintiSafe Econo1, Fisher Chemical) and counted on a 1900TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).  Modeling  A model of the EZH2 core catalytic domain lining the substrate lysine binding channel was built by homology to the G9a/EHMT2 structure (PDB code 2o8j), based on the alignment shown in supplemental Figure 6 and supplemental Figure 8. The EZH2 sequence was threaded onto the G9a backbone, and when homologous, G9a side chains were used as a template to position EZH2 residues, according to the “minimize tethers” command using ICM, Version 3.6-1g (Molsoft LLC17).  Retroviral infection and B-cell in vitro differentiation assay  Parental strain mice were bred and maintained as approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. Primary mouse bone marrow cells were transduced as previously described with minor modifications.18 Details are in the supplemental data.  Go to: Results EZH2Y641F/N proteins are expressed approximately 1:1 with wild-type EZH2 in DLBCL cell lines  Conspicuously, the EZH2 mutations identified in GCB lymphomas are all located in exon 15 of EZH2, and all are missense mutations that change a single highly evolutionarily conserved tyrosine residue in the catalytic SET domain (Tyr641 or WT) to phenylalanine (Y641F), asparagine (Y641N), histidine (Y641H), or serine (Y641S).1 This recurrent pattern of a heterozygous somatic mutation in a functionally conserved region, affecting a single residue, is highly suggestive of a gain of dominant mode of action, either dominant negative or a gain-of-function/neomorph. Both wild-type (EZH2WT) and EZH2Y641 variant transcripts could be observed in lymphoma-derived cell lines (Y641N: DB, Karpas 422, SU-DHL-6, and Y641F: WSU-DLCL-2) bearing the mutations (supplemental Figure 1). Potentially, the mutations at EZH2Y641 could alter the stability of the protein. To investigate this possibility, we developed a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode MS signature for tryptic peptides covering the mutated region of EZH2 (wild-type, MutF) and a common region from tandem MS spectra of recombinant EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F (Figure 1A; supplemental Figure 2A-B) and used this to estimate the abundance of mutant EZH2 in malignant cells. To determine the amount of mutant EZH2 in a DLCBL cell line, we immunoprecipitated total endogenous EZH2 from nuclear lysates of the WSU-DLCL2 cell line (EZH2Y641F) and the DOHH2 cell line (EZH2WT) from 2 independent experiments. Gel electrophoresis fractions of the immunoprecipitates encompassing the size of EZH2 were analyzed for the peptides by MRM-MS. Signals for the wild-type, MutF, and common peptides were observed in the WSU-DLCL2 cell line, whereas only wild-type and common signals were observed in the DOHH2 cell line (Figure 1B; supplemental Figure 2C; and data not shown), demonstrating that both EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F proteins were present in the WSU-DLCL2 cell line. The wild-type/MutF peak area ratios were compared with the wild-type/MutF peak area ratios of an external standard curve of mixtures of recombinant EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F (Figure 1C). The percentage EZH2WT was calculated from an equation fit to the standard curve. The comparison indicated that there was a 40:60 EZH2WT/EZH2Y641F protein ratio in the WSU-DLCL2 sample (Figure 1C; supplemental Figure 2C); thus, approximately equal quantities of mutant EZH2 protein are present, showing that the mutations do not adversely affect the stability of the protein in vivo and therefore that any differences in activity should not be explained by a highly skewed ratio of wild-type and mutant proteins alone.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Quantitation of EZH2 wild-type and EZH2 Y641F (MutF) protein expression by mass spectrometry. (A) Tandem MS spectra of recombinant EZH2 wild-type and MutF peptides (residues 635-654) used in the MRM assay. Peptide fragments (y and b ions) identified are ... EZH2Y641 mutation bearing B-cell lymphoma cell lines and GCB lymphoma containing tissues exhibit higher levels of H3K27me3 than wild-type  Initial studies1 of EZH2Y641F/N cell-free, reconstituted PRC2 complexes showed that the mutant EZH2-containing PRC2 complexes had 7-fold less activity in converting unmethylated H3K27 target peptides, compared with wild-type. This would suggest that mutation-bearing cell lines and tumors should have globally reduced H3K27me3 levels. A direct comparison is complicated by the nonisogenic status of the cell lines and, in the case of primary tumor material, by variable tumor cellularity. Nevertheless, we measured H3K27me3 (with 2 different H3K27me3 antibodies, verified for monospecificity; see “Western blotting and immunoprecipitation”; supplemental Figure 3) with respect to total H3, in a series of GCB-derived lymphoma cell lines, sequenced to determine the presence or absence of Y641 mutations. Unexpectedly, we found that EZH2Y641F/N bearing cell lines (Figure 2A,G) and tumors (Figure 2B,H) generally exhibited greater levels of H3K27me3 than wild-type cases, suggesting hyperactivity of the PRC2 complexes.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Y641 mutations in B-cell lines and tumors increase steady state of H3K27me3. (A) Steady-state H3K27me3 levels in DLBCL. Nuclear lysates from DLCBCLs with either wild-type EZH2 (Pfeiffer, MD903, NU-DHL-1, NU-DUL-1, DOHH2, and Toledo) or heterozygous for ... EZH2Y641F/N mutants act dominantly in HEK293T and in vitro differentiated B cells to increase H3K27me3 levels  The first 2 sets of observations strongly suggested that EZH2Y641F/N mutants could act dominantly in cells to increase H3K27me3. To test this idea, we expressed wild-type and EZH2Y641F/N proteins in HEK293T cells (wild-type for EZH2) and measured the effect on total H3K27me3 levels. Both stable and transient expression of EZH2Y641F/N mutant proteins in a wild-type context (HEK293T cells) results in a significant increase in H3K27me3 (Figure 2C; supplemental Figure 4), whereas wild-type EZH2 or the methyltransferase dead EZH2H689A,19 expressed in the same cell types results in a barely detectable increase in H3K27me3 (Figure 2D). Notably, the increase in the steady-state levels of H3K27me3 occurred, even though stable expression of GFP-EZH2Y641 protein was lower compared with endogenous EZH2 (Figure 2C upper band). To show that GFP-EZH2 was expressed as part of the PRC2,13 we immunoprecipitated GFP-tagged EZH2 and probed with EZH2, EED, or SUZ12. As shown in Figure 2E, mutant EZH2 was able to coprecipitate with other members of the PRC2 complex. EZH2Y641 mutants thus shifted the in vivo equilibrium levels of H3K27 methylation from monomethylation and dimethylation to predominantly trimethylation (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the cell lines bearing EZH2Y641F/N mutations are also uniformly and markedly more resistant (supplemental Figure 5) to 3-deazaneplanocin A, a global small-molecule inhibitor of single-carbon transfer methyltransferases, which has been reported as a nonspecific inhibitor of EZH2 activity20,21 (specific inhibitors have yet to be described). Finally, we asked whether Y641 variants were capable of conferring a gain of H3K27me3 on B-cell lineages in the mouse. Primary murine primary bone marrow cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing GFP and either wild-type EZH2 or EZH2Y641F and differentiated into the B-cell lineage in the presence of IL7 and FLT3-L. Measurement of total H3K27me3 again showed increased H3K27me3 (Figure 2F) in cells bearing EZH2Y641F, whereas EZH2WT constructs did not confer this phenotype (Figure 2F).  Structural modeling suggests that Tyr 641 residue may be involved in product equilibrium  We sought to understand why EZH2Y641F/N variants act dominantly through a structural analysis of this region in EZH2. Scanning mutagenesis and solved structures have provided insights into regions governing substrate preferences and specificity of several methytransferases; however, a fully solved structure of the EZH2 protein is not currently available. We therefore undertook structural homology modeling of the catalytic core region of EZH2 on the high resolution crystal structures of the lysine dimethyltransferase, G9a, and the lysine monomethyltransferase, SETD7 for which there are also detailed enzymatic data9,10 (Figure 3; supplemental Figures 6-8). Y641 of EZH2 aligns with Y1067 in G9a, which when mutated to Phe was recently shown to convert G9a into a trimethyltransferase with a concomitant decrease in monomethylation and dimethylation activity.9 Similarly, the analogous residue in SETD7 (Y245) can also confer trimethyltransferase activity on SETD7 when mutated to Ala.10 The structures reveal that Tyr in this position forms a hydrogen bond with the substrate lysine amino nitrogen moiety and keeps one of its lone pair electrons oriented away from the SAM methyl donor (Figure 3 black arrow). Thus, this Tyr residue “ties up” the face of the recipient lysyl nitrogen to which the third methyl would otherwise be transferred. This Tyr-substrate hydrogen bond also contributes to the preferred binding affinity of the enzyme for monomethylated and unmethylated substrates as evidenced by the weaker Km values of the Y1067F G9a mutants for unmethylated and monomethylated substrates.9 Furthermore, the Km of G9a Y1067F for dimethylated substrate reflects a stronger affinity for H3K27me2 than for monomethylated or unmethylated substrates.9 In the trimethyltransferases, such as EZH2, this tyrosine residue is also conserved, probably facilitating the first 2 methyl transfer reactions. Because the active sites of EZH2WT can also accommodate a third methyl group, it has probably evolved a compromise between monomethylation, dimethylation, and trimethylation (relative to G9a, for example), perhaps via small structural adjustments that allow it to carry out trimethylation, even in the presence of the Y641 residue. Thus, mutation of Y641 in EZH2 to residues, such as Phe (F) or Asn (N), which do not disturb the structure, can be predicted to abrogate the affinity for unmethylated or monomethylated lysine substrates while at the same time reducing steric crowding in the active site, thereby potentially facilitating the catalytic efficiency for trimethylation.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Homology model of the active site of EZH2. The model is based on sequence and structure alignment with histone dimethyltransferase G9a/EHMT2 (PDBID 2O8J).9 This was also structurally aligned with GLP/EHMT1 bound to an H3K9me2 peptide substrate (PDBID ... Mutations of these tyrosine residues (analogous to Y641 in EZH2) result in a shift of product equilibrium to favor the trimethylated state. The structural and functional basis of the substitution of Tyr to smaller residues, particularly Phe, is known as the Tyr/Phe switch.11,22 Although the Tyr/Phe switch has been described at other residues from scanning mutagenesis in vitro, this is the first example of a disease-associated Tyr/Phe switch.  EZH2Y641-containing PRC2 complexes show increased substrate preference for dimethylated peptide in vitro  To test the structural hypothesis that EZH2Y641 mutations have a reduced ability to methylate H3K27me0/1 substrates but increased ability to methylate H3K27me2 substrates, we next studied the function of the enzyme in vitro. Because the relative catalytic efficiency of the EZH2/PRC2 complex for each methyl addition step is poorly understood, we carried out a 3H methyl incorporation assay using recombinant PRC2 complexes,23 containing EED, SUZ12, AEBP2, RbAp48, and wild-type or EZH2Y641 mutants, as previously described.1 We assayed the activity of the variant proteins by measuring 3H-methyl incorporation, using unmodified, chemically synthesized monomethylated and dimethylated K27 substrate peptides, in preference to nucleosomes because the latter contain endogenous histone modifications (supplemental Figure 3) that make nucleosome assays difficult to interpret (supplemental Figure 9). Strikingly, EZH2Y641 mutants showed (Figure 4) strongly reduced activity on unmethylated or monomethylated peptides but markedly enhanced activity on dimethylated peptides compared with EZH2 wild-type containing PRC2 complexes. We estimated the specific activity of the protein complexes (Table 1) and observed that the EZH2Y641F/N containing PRC2 complexes are approximately twice as active on dimethylated peptides compared with wild-type. These data indicate that EZH2Y641F/N mutations alter the substrate specificity, as suggested by the structural model, in favor of dimethylated peptides compared with PRC2 containing complexes with only wild-type EZH2.  Figure 4 Figure 4 In vitro PRC2 activity of EZH2. Histone methyltransferase reaction was performed using 1.2μM biotinylated peptide substrate (ie, peptide mimicking the H3 tail, H3(21-44)), which has been unmethylated (H3K27me0, open bar or me0), monomethylated ... Table 1 Table 1 Specific activity of PRC2 complexes Go to: Discussion The relevance of somatic mutations in chromatin-modifying enzymes in cancer has recently been emphasized by discoveries of high-frequency somatic mutations in UTX, JMJD demethylases, ARID1A, and in EZH2.1,24–27 However, the mechanisms by which these mutations promote or enable carcinogenesis are largely unknown, as are the relevant modes of allelism (dominance, recessive). We show here, for the first time, a dominant (neomorphic) allele of a histone methyltransferase associated with a specific cancer.  Taken together, our data strongly suggest that EZH2Y641F/N variants in lymphoma act dominantly, through a mechanism that involves altered substrate catalytic specificity of the mutant EZH2 enzyme for its substrates. Our data show that, despite equimolar quantities of mutant and wild-type proteins in malignant cells, there is greater total H3K27me3 in mutant-bearing cell lines and primary tumors. Moreover, the EZH2Y641F/N variants have a strong dominant effect on H3K27me3 levels in cell lines that are wild-type for EZH2. They act in trans to provide a strong gain of function.  The probable mechanism is suggested by structural and enzymatic analysis of the EZH2Y641F/N variants. As shown in the cell-free assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, EZH2Y641F/N cannot carry out trimethylation of unmodified or monomethylated substrates (Figure 4)1 but still are able to form PRC2 complexes (Figure 2E) and increase the steady state of H3K27 trimethylation in vivo (Figure 2C-D). This means that it is probable that the gain of function of EZH2Y641 mutants would be to shift the monomethylated and/or dimethylated state of H3K27 to that of trimethylation (Figure 2D) on some bona fide EZH2 targets. It is clear that in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-histone H3K27me1 and anti-histone H3K27me3,28 that expression of EZH2Y641 mutants could shift the steady-state levels from H3K27me1 (which is correlated with gene activation) and H3K27me2 to H3K27me3, which is correlated with gene repression.29 Whether or not these EZH2Y641 mutants are able to catalyze higher order methylation on non-EZH2 (such as EZH130) targets remains an area of active investigation. The mechanism and the in vitro assays show that EZH2Y641F/N cannot catalyze monomethylation and dimethylation efficiently; therefore, the mutant protein is completely dependent on the presence of wild-type proteins for the gain-of-function effect. This requirement for a wild-type copy of EZH2 is highly analogous to the behavior of the Drosophila E(z)1 allele31,32; E(z)1 (homologous to EZH2Y641N) leads to a phenotypic gain of function and has been shown to act as a dominant repressor of E(z) target genes. However, the unique phenotype of the E(z)1 allele depends on the presence of the wild-type allele, and the E(z)1 enzyme appears to be inactive when assayed in vitro.32  It has been shown that overexpression of EZH2 is a feature of some cancers,2–4 whereas histone H3K27 demethylase UTX was found to be inactivated in other tumors.24,25 This would suggest that the increase in H3K27me3 levels may be achieved in cancer cells by redundant pathways induced by overexpression of EZH2 or inactivation of UTX. Our findings are consistent with this idea, as dominant EZH2Y641 mutations also increase the levels of H3K27me3 (Figure 5). It is currently unknown whether the gain of H3K27me3 in germinal center-derived B-cell lymphomas reflects an increase of methylation at normal PRC2 targets, or possibly a gain of methylation at noncanonical PRC2 targets. The significance of H3K27me3 may well be lineage/cell type dependent, and this will require future conditional alleles and lineage studies to dissect as well as improved efficiency of ChIP-seq methods in small cell populations. However, recent studies have emphasized that GCB lymphomas are dependent on EZH2 and that knockdown of EZH2 in GCB cell lines bearing Y641 mutations results in cell cycle arrest in germinal center B cells.33 Knockdown of EZH2 in this context results in increased expression of PRC2-regulated tumor suppressors. This is consistent with the physiologic roles of EZH2 in B-cell development and differentiation,34–36 although it should be noted that a full understanding of the PRC2 targets in B cells remains to be elucidated. Taken together with the present study, these support the notion that EZH2 is causally implicated.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Model depicting pathways to increase H3K27me3 levels that result in cancer. In this schematic diagram: solid arrow represents a direct effect; dotted arrow, multiple steps that lead to an effect. The observation of a dominant, gain-of-function mutation through altered catalytic preference in histone methyltransferases is unprecedented in cancer and carries important implications for drug development against EZH2. It is interesting to note that the substrate pockets of the mutant enzymes probably have a new, larger shape (smaller side chains of His, Asn, or Phe relative to wild-type Tyr), which potentially could be selectively targeted therapeutically in a strategy similar to that used to develop selective inhibitors of glycine gatekeeper mutants of protein kinases.37  EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) is a critical enzymatic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which trimethylates histone H3 (H3K27) to mediate gene repression. Somatic mutations, overexpression and hyperactivation of EZH2 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several forms of cancer. In particular, recurrent gain-of-function mutations targeting EZH2 Y641 occur most frequently in follicular lymphoma and aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and are associated with H3K27me3 hyperactivation, which contributes to lymphoma pathogenesis. However, the post-translational mechanisms of EZH2 regulation are not completely understood. Here we show that EZH2 is a novel interactor and substrate of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP (FBXW1). β-TrCP ubiquitinates EZH2 and Jak2-mediated phosphorylation on Y641 directs β-TrCP-mediated EZH2 degradation. RNA interference-mediated silencing of β-TrCP or inhibition of Jak2 results in EZH2 stabilization with attendant increase in H3K27 trimethylation activity. Importantly, the EZH2Y641 mutants recurrently implicated in lymphoma pathogenesis are unable to bind β-TrCP. Further, endogenous EZH2Y641 mutants in lymphoma cells exhibit increased EZH2 stability and H3K27me3 hyperactivity. Our studies demonstrate that β-TrCP has an important role in controlling H3K27 trimethylation activity and lymphoma pathogenesis by targeting EZH2 for degradation.  Keywords: EZH2; SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase; protein degradation; lymphoma Top of page Introduction Epigenetic regulators including the polycomb group (PcG) of proteins have a critical role in the pathogenesis and evolution of several types of cancer.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 PcG proteins are also known to regulate self-renewal of somatic and cancer stem cells.5, 6 Polycomb repressor complexes make defined but reversible changes in gene expression pattern in a context-dependent manner and their activity largely depends upon the formation of complete repressor complex.7 Hence, the length of activity and target selectivity of the complex may depend upon protein turnover of the complex. Assembled together, PcG proteins form two large protein complexes, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), that act in concert to effect gene repression.8  Polycomb complexes repress target genes by covalent modifications of histone tails catalyzed by PRC1 (histone 2A Lys 119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119ub1)) and PRC2 (H3K27me2, me3) as well as direct chromatin compaction.8, 9, 10 Efficient H3K27 methylation requires the cooperation of several PRC2 core components, including EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction via its SET domain and establishes chromatin marks associated with gene silencing.11 Although overexpression of EZH2 and its increased H3K27 methylation have generally been associated with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, recurrent somatic mutations in EZH2 have been recently reported in germinal center B-cell (GCB)-derived lymphomas (follicular lymphoma and the GCB subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). These mutations, which replace a single tyrosine in the SET domain of the EZH2 protein (Y641), occur in 21.7% of GCB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 27.6% of follicular lymphomas and are absent from activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.12, 13 This mutation acts as a disease-associated gain-of-function mutation in EZH2.14 Consequently, B-cell lymphoma cell lines and lymphoma samples harboring heterozygous EZH2Y641 mutations exhibit increased histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) activity as well as a lymphoproliferative phenotype with expansion of the GCB-cell compartment.14 Significantly, inhibition of H3K27me3 activity is emerging as a promising approach for targeted therapy of EZH2 dysregulated cancers.14, 15, 16, 17, 18  Although extensive research has been conducted to understand the role of polycomb group of proteins in cancer pathogenesis, few studies have been aimed at understanding the post-translational regulation of these proteins. We and others have recently reported that core components of polycomb group proteins are regulated at post-translational level by the ubiquitin proteasome system.19, 20, 21 Skp1/cullin1/F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complexes are the largest family of multicomponent RING E3 ubiquitin ligases that control the degradation of many important regulatory proteins and have been implicated in the regulation of epigenetic regulators.22, 23, 24, 25 Specifically in this regard, we demonstrated that BMI1, the catalytically important subunit of the PRC1 complex, is regulated by SCFβ-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase (henceforth referred to as β-TrCP).19 Reports indicate that the PRC2 catalytic subunit EZH2 is stabilized by inhibition of the proteasomal pathway,7, 20, 21, 26 including post-translational regulation of excess PRC2 components by E3 ubiquitin ligase pRAJA120 and post-translational regulation of EZH2 during neuronal differentiation by Smurf2 E3 ligase.21 However, the mechanism of EZH2 degradation and its implication in PRC2-mediated methyl transferase activity in a cancer-specific context is not fully understood. In the present study, we report that the cullin1-RING E3 ligase β-TrCP has a key role in regulating H3K27me by modulating EZH2 stability. Our results also reveal an unconventional recognition of tyrosine 641 residue in EZH2 by β-TrCP.  Top of page Results EZH2 undergoes proteasome-mediated degradation To examine the components of PRC2 complex that are regulated by proteasomal turnover, we first examined the levels of each core component in the absence of other critical core components in the complex. MCF7 cells were subjected to RNA interference (RNAi) SMART pool-mediated knockdown of PRC2 core components EZH2, SUZ12 (suppressor of zeste 12 homolog), EED (embryonic ectoderm development) or scrambled control for 72 h followed by treatment with vehicle control or MG132 for 6 h. Western blot analysis of cell lysates indicated that the EZH2 catalytic component of PRC2 undergoes degradation in the absence of other two components SUZ12 or EED and its levels can be rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Supplementary Figure S1A). To examine the turnover of EZH2 in the presence or absence of a functional proteasome system, we determined the half-life of EZH2 in MCF7 cells by inhibiting the de novo protein synthesis using cycloheximide (CHX) in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Our data indicated that like the known proteasomal target CDC25A, the half-life of EZH2 is prolonged in the presence of MG132 (Figure 1a). Figure 1.

(a) MCF7 cells were treated with DMSO or MG132 (10 μm) for 1 h before CHX addition and cells were harvested at indicated time points. Whole-cell lysates were immunoblotted for EZH2, CDC25A and β-actin. Quantification of western blot (WB) images was performed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) and is presented in graphical form. (b) Cullin1 interacts with endogenous EZH2 in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with Flag-tagged cullins as indicated and after 48 h were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 8 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using Flag resin and analyzed by WB for indicated proteins. (c) Concentration-dependent increase in the expression of functionally defective dominant-negative cullin1 mutant (V5-tagged C-terminal truncation Δcullin 1 amino-acid residues 1–452) results in the accumulation of endogenous EZH2 in HEK293 cells.

Cells were harvested after 48 h of transfection and cell lysates were analyzed for indicated proteins using WB analyses. (d) Cullin1 knockdown using three different shRNA specific for cullin1 results in EZH2 protein accumulation in MCF7 cells. Lentiviral particles containing shRNA targeting different regions of cullin1 were used to stably knockdown cullin1 in MCF7 cells.

Full figure and legend (99K)  Multi-subunit cullin–RING complexes comprise the largest known class of E3 ligases.27 We first examined whether a specific cullin-RING complex is involved in controlling EZH2 degradation. To test this hypothesis, Flag-tagged cullin1, cullin2, cullin3, cullin4A, cullin4B, cullin5 and cullin7 were transfected in HEK293 cells. After 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 6 h followed by Flag immunoprecipitation (IP) and analyzed by western blotting. Results demonstrated that EZH2 (endogenous) specifically interacts with cullin1, but not with any of the other six members of the cullin family (Figure 1b). To further investigate a possible role for cullin1 RING ligases in EZH2 proteolysis, V5-tagged dominant-negative cullin1 (1–452ΔC) was transiently expressed in HEK293 or HeLa cells. After 48 h of transfection, cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting. Overexpression of dominant-negative cullin1 resulted in the accumulation of EZH2 protein in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293 (Figure 1c) and HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S1B). As expected, β-catenin, a known substrate of the cullin1-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL), also accumulated following the expression of dominant-negative cullin1 (Figure 1c). Nedd8 modification is required for cullin activation to induce a conformational change that increases the proximity between the E2 enzyme and the substrate.28 Accordingly, we demonstrated that treatment of HeLa cells with MLN4924, a selective inhibitor of Nedd8-activating enzyme, followed by CHX treatment accumulated EZH2 steady-state levels (Supplementary Figure S1C). Moreover, depletion of endogenous cullin1 by stable expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting cullin1 led to EZH2 protein accumulation in MCF7 cells (Figure 1d), indicating that a cullin1-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase may have a role in the regulation of EZH2 stability.  EZH2 interacts specifically with β-TrCP Cullin1 associates with F-box proteins via an adaptor protein Skp1 to establish a functional multicomponent SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. F-box proteins are the substrate binding units of the SCF E3 ligase complex.29, 30 We sought to explore which F-box protein complexed with cullin1 is responsible for EZH2 recognition. We examined a panel of eight different F-box proteins for their interaction with endogenous EZH2 using co-IP. Briefly, Flag-tagged F-box proteins β-TrCP (Fbxw1), Fbxw2, Fbxw4, Fbxw5, Fbxo7, Fbxo22 and FbxL1 (Skp2) were expressed in 293T cells. After 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with MG132 for 6 h. Cells were harvested in IP buffer and cell lysates were subjected to Flag IP followed by western blot analysis. The results indicated that among all F-box proteins tested, β-TrCP demonstrated exclusive interaction with EZH2 (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure S2A). Moreover, PRC2 core component SUZ12 also co-precipitated with β-TrCP. Figure 2. Figure 2 - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this.

(a) Endogenous EZH2 exclusively interact with exogenous β-TrCP among several different F-box proteins.

HEK293 cells were transfected with TAP-HA-tagged β-TrCP WT and mutants as indicated, and after 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 8 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin resin and analyzed by WB analysis for indicated proteins. (d) Illustration of WT EZH2 with its putative domain structure and SUZ12-binding domain deletion mutant of EZH2 (ΔSUZ12BD). (e) EZH2 directly interacts with β-TrCP independent of its association with SUZ12. HEK293 cells were transfected with TAP-HA-tagged β-TrCP-WT as well as Flag-tagged EZH2 WT or ΔSUZ12BD, and after 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 8 h. Cells lysated were immunoprecipitated using streptavidin or Flag resin and analyzed by WB analysis as indicated. (f) Knockdown of β-TrCP stabilizes EZH2 protein. MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with siRNA SMART pool targeting β-TrCP for 72 h followed by DMSO or CHX (100 μg/ml) treatment for stated time points.

To do this, we first expressed tandem affinity purification-hemagglutinin (TAP-HA)-tagged β-TrCP along with two other F-box proteins, Fbxo45 and Skp2, in HEK293 cells. After 48 h, cells were harvested and cell lysates were treated with micrococcal nuclease to digest the large chromatin complex into small nucleosome size particles. These lysates were examined for efficient digestion of nucleosome particles of ~200 bp by agarose gel analysis, and then subjected to TAP-tagged IP for F-box proteins and examined for co-immunoprecipitating proteins. As shown in Supplementary Figures S2B and C, β-TrCP showed interaction with endogenous PRC2 components EZH2 and SUZ12 but not EED or EZH1. Moreover, all F-box proteins efficiently immunoprecipitated their respective protein complex component Skp1. BMI1, YAP and β-catenin, known targets of β-TrCP, and p27, a known target of Skp2, were used as positive controls as indicated (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figures S2B and C). Importantly, we demonstrated that IP of endogenous β-TrCP co-precipitated endogenous EZH2 in HEK293 cells (Figure 2b), and reciprocally, IP of endogenous EZH2 co-precipitated endogenous β-TrCP (Supplementary Figure S3).  β-TrCP binding to its enzymatic substrates is largely facilitated by its 7th WD repeat motif.31 Particularly, mutation of amino-acid R474 residing in the 7th WD repeat motif of β-TrCP (ΔWD7) is known to abolish its interaction with its known substrate β-catenin.31 Hence, the EZH2–β-TrCP interaction was examined using TAP-HA-tagged β-TrCP wild-type (WT) or mutants with deletion of the 7th WD repeat motif or R474A mutant of β-TrCP. Briefly, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with TAP-HA-tagged β-TrCP WT or its mutants (ΔWD7 and R474A). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and TAP IPs were performed. Results demonstrated that deletion or mutation of the critical arginine residue in β-TrCP abolished its binding with EZH2 (Figure 2c). As expected, β-catenin, a known substrate, co-precipitated with WT β-TrCP. In addition, the interaction of SUZ12 with β-TrCP was also abolished in the presence of the β-TrCP mutant R474A and ΔWD. Hence, to rule out an indirect interaction of EZH2-β-TrCP through SUZ12, we generated a Flag-tagged EZH2 deletion mutant (EZH2 ΔSUZ12 BD) that does not contain the SUZ12-binding region (Figure 2d).32 Flag IP experiments demonstrated that the EZH2 mutant that is not able to interact with SUZ12 retained its binding with β-TrCP, indicating a direct interaction of EZH2 with β-TrCP (Figure 2e). As knockdown of SUZ12 promotes rapid proteolysis of EZH2 (Supplementary Figure S1),7 we next determined if this proteolysis is mediated by β-TrCP. This experiment showed that EZH2 degradation promoted by loss of SUZ12 is rescued by further knockdown of β-TrCP (Supplementary Figure S4A). To examine if SUZ12 silencing affects EZH2–β-TrCP interaction, 293T cells were transfected with SUZ12 small interfering RNA (siRNA) SMART pool for 48 h followed by TAP-HA β-TrCP overexpression for another 48 h Cell lysates were subjected to TAP IP. These experiments reveal a modest enhancement of the EZH2–β-TrCP interaction after SUZ12 silencing as compared with scramble control (Supplementary Figure S4B).  β-TrCP regulates EZH2 degradation The specific interaction of the β-TrCP with endogenous EZH2 prompted us to investigate whether β-TrCP regulates EZH2 proteolysis by proteasomal degradation. First, we examined the role of β-TrCP in EZH2 degradation using RNAi. MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with scrambled or siRNA SMART pool specifically targeting β-TrCP. After 72 h of transfection, examination of the half-life of EZH2 using CHX chase experiments revealed stabilization and prolongation of the half-life of the EZH2 protein upon knockdown of β-TrCP (Figure 2f). Other PRC2 core component SUZ12 also show modest stabilization upon β-TrCP silencing. However, there is no alteration in the half-life of EED, which was observed following β-TrCP knockdown. Proteolysis of β-catenin, a known substrate of β-TrCP was used as positive control. The β-TrCP known substrate β-catenin also shows significant increase in half-life by β-TrCP knockdown (Figure 2f). Further, we tested whether dominant-negative mutant of β-TrCP (ΔF-β-TrCP) can abrogate the EZH2 ubiquitination. For this experiment, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with vector or ΔF-β-TrCP as well as HA-tagged ubiquitin. After 48 h of transfection, cells were harvested following 6 h of MG132 treatment in IP buffer and endogenous EZH2 were immunoprecipitated and examined by western blot analysis. Results suggest that the expression of ΔF-β-TrCP significantly reduced EZH2 ubiquitination (Supplementary Figure S5). EZH2Y641 mutation abrogates β-TrCP-mediated degradation Although overexpression of EZH2 and increased H3K27me have generally been associated with both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, somatic heterozygous missense mutations within the catalytic SET domain of EZH2 that alter a single highly evolutionarily conserved tyrosine residue Tyr 641 (Y641F, Y641N, Y641S and Y641H) were recently reported in follicular lymphoma and GCB subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.12, 13 Mutation at Y641 of EZH2 contributes a gain-of-function status with increased H3K27me activity.14 We postulated that this mutation could affect the protein turnover of EZH2. To investigate this possibility, we examined the half-life of EZH2 in HEK293 cells overexpressing EZH2 WT or Y641N mutant. Our results revealed that EZH2 Y641N mutant showed prolonged half-life of EZH2 when compared with EZH2 WT (Figure 3a). Next, we examined the half-life of EZH2 in cell lines that harbor heterozygous mutations at Y641 (SUDHL 4 (Y641S), SUDHL 6 (Y641N), L428 (Y641N) and KARPAS 422 (Y641N)) along with others expressing wild-type Y641 (SUDHL 5 (WT), SUDHL 8 (WT)). These studies revealed that in cell lines with Y641 mutation, EZH2 exhibited longer half-life than those with WT EZH2. In this regard, EZH2Y641 mutants exhibited stable protein expression up to 12 h after CHX treatment, while EZH2 WT demonstrated quicker turnover with half-life of ~8 h (Figure 3b). To investigate the possibility that delay in protein turnover of EZH2 is contributed by β-TrCP, we next examined if mutations at Y641 residue of EZH2 affects its interaction with β-TrCP. To address this question, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-Flag-tagged EZH2 WT, EZH2 Y641N or EZH2 Y641F mutants along with vector control. After 48 h, cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 6 h. Cells were harvested and cell lysate was subjected to Flag co-IP. The results demonstrated that EZH2 WT interacts with endogenous β-TrCP but EZH2 Y641N and Y641F mutants do not (Figure 3c). Further, mutation at Y641 in EZH2 markedly reduced β-TrCP induced in vivo as well as in vitro ubiquitination (Figure 3d and Supplementary Figure S6). Figure 3.

After 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 8 h cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using Flag resin and analyzed by WB analysis for indicated proteins.  Full figure and legend (160K)  Phosphorylation of EZH2Y641 by Jak2 promotes EZH2–β-TrCP interaction To determine whether the interaction between β-TrCP and EZH2 was phosphorylation-dependent, we performed co-IP experiments in the presence of λ-phosphatase with and without a phosphatase inhibitor. As compared with control, λ-phosphatase treatment diminished β-TrCP interaction with EZH2, while the interaction was restored following λ-phosphatase treatment in the presence of phosphatase inhibitor (Figure 4a). These results indicate that Y641 residue in EZH2 is critical for its binding to β-TrCP, and can potentially be phosphorylated. We predicted that tyrosine kinase Jak2, which recognizes YXX[L/I/V] motif for phosphorylation of substrate, may be responsible for EZH2 phosphorylation at Y641 residue33 (Figure 4b). To test whether Jak2-mediated phosphorylation on EZH2 promote its proteolysis, we treated HeLa cells with Jak2 inhibitor ruxolitinib at different concentrations as indicated. Jak2 inhibition resulted in the accumulation of basal level of EZH2 protein (Figure 4c). Further, we examined the role of Jak2 inhibition in EZH2 degradation. HeLa cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ruxolitinib (10 nm) overnight and subjected to CHX chase experiments. Results revealed stabilization and prolongation of the EZH2 protein half-life upon ruxolitinib-mediated Jak2 inhibition (Figure 4c). To ascertain the role of Jak2 phosphorylation on EZH2–β-TrCP interaction, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with TAP-HA tagged β-TrCP, and after 48 h of transfection, cells treated with DMSO or ruxolitinib at indicated concentration. TAP IP followed by western blot analysis indicated that Jak2 inhibition significantly abrogated EZH2–β-TrCP interaction (Figure 4d). Treatment of ruxolitinib inhibited phosphorylation of STAT5b, a known downstream target of Jak2, as a proof of Jak2 inhibition. To assess the phosphorylation by Jak2, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion of C terminus (amino-acid residues 580–668) of EZH2 encompassing Y641 residue-mediated Jak2 recognition motif were used in in vitro protein kinase assays. EZH2 WT fragment was phosphorylated by Jak2 but mutation of Y641 to asparagine or phenylalanine resulted in the loss of phosphorylation. No phosphorylation of the control GST protein was observed (Figure 4e). These data indicate that EZH2 protein can be specifically phosphorylated at Y641 residue by Jak2 and this phosphorylation promotes EZH2–β-TrCP interaction leading to EZH2 proteolysis. Figure 4.

Purified GST or GST-tagged EZH2 and its mutant proteins were incubated with or without purified Jak2 in 20 μl reaction. Two microliters of this reaction were resolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and immunoblotted with anti-GST antibody. The remaining 18 μl were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The proteins were resolved on SDS–PAGE gel and visualized by autoradiography.

Knockdown of β-TrCP resulted in the accumulation of EZH2 as well as its H3K27me activity. In contrast, knockdown of EZH2 caused a significant loss of H3K27me, while knockdown of β-TrCP along with EZH2 partially rescued the levels of EZH2 as well as its H3K27me activity (Figures 4a and b). CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN2A/p16 are known downstream transcriptional targets of EZH2.14, 34, 35 To further validate functional consequences of EZH2 stabilization as a result of β-TrCP silencing, we examined if knockdown of β-TrCP-mediated accumulation of EZH2 repressed transcript levels of its downstream targets CDKN1A and CDKN2A. In keeping with our hypothesis and consistent with predictions from previous results, β-TrCP silencing resulted in protein accumulation of EZH2 as well as downregulation of transcript levels of CDKN1A and CDKN2A its known downstream targets (Figure 4c). No change in EZH2 transcript levels were observed with β-TrCP silencing. Top of page Discussion In the present study, we report that phosphorylation of EZH2 at Y641 residue by Jak2 promotes β-TrCP-mediated EZH2 degradation and consequent regulation of H3K27me. Generally, β-TrCP recognizes substrates phosphorylated at serine/threonine residues within the context of a canonical DSGxxS phosphodegron.29 In this report, we identify a novel tyrosine phosphorylation-based recognition of EZH2 by the β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase. Interestingly, the tyrosine required in EZH2 in order for it to be recognized by β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase happens to be the most recurrently mutated residue in GC-derived B-cell lymphomas and these mutations provide a gain of function to EZH2 methyl transferase activity.12, 14  EZH2, the catalytically active component of PRC2, di- and trimethylates Lys 27 of histone H3, a histone mark linked to gene silencing and tumor development. The enzymatic activity of EZH2 largely depends upon the formation of the PRC2 complex comprised of EZH2, EED and SUZ12.36 Variations in the levels of individual components of this complex could therefore affect the activity of the PRC2 holoenzyme. In fact, Pasini et al.7 report that loss of SUZ12 promotes EZH2 proteolysis and thus SUZ12 prevents the degradation of EZH2 and preserves enzymatic activity of EZH2-containing complexes.7 To better understand the contribution of modulation of rate limiting components in the PRC2 complex, we investigated the effects of potential post-translational regulation of PRC2 components. By inhibiting the proteasomal turnover of PRC2 core components in the absence of other two critical subunits of the complex, we observed that EZH2 undergoes quick proteolysis in the absence of a stable PRC2 complex. On the basis of the fact that the CRLs form the largest known class of multicomponent E3 ubiquitin ligase family in eukaryotes and target a wide array of substrates involved in several biological processes,22, 27 we sought to examine a role for CRL-mediated EZH2 regulation by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. To identify the CRL machinery that targets EZH2 for degradation, we screened the panel of cullin family E3 ligases for interaction with EZH2 and discovered that a cullin1-mediated process was involved in EZH2 proteolysis. Further studies demonstrated that phosphorylation of EZH2 at Y641 residue by Jak2 promotes β-TrCP-mediated EZH2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby controlling PRC2 complex-mediated H3K27me activity.  Somatic mutations targeting Y641 in GC-derived non-Hodgkin lymphoma12 confer a gain-of-function capacity to EZH2.14 We investigated whether these mutations resulted in increased stability of EZH2 protein. In this regard, all tested mutant cell lines endogenously harboring Y641 mutations showed delay in EZH2 protein turnover as compared with WT. Next, we investigated if this mutation affects EZH2 interaction with β-TrCP. Our results indicated that mutations in the Y641 residue of EZH2 abrogated its binding and consequent ubiquitination and degradation by β-TrCP. We further show that β-TrCP interaction with EZH2 is phosphorylation dependent and interestingly this phosphorylation event occurs on Y641 residue by Jak2 tyrosine kinase. To the best of our knowledge, such recognition mechanism has not been described in association with β-TrCP.  Our conclusion that EZH2 is a physiological substrate of β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase is supported by several lines of evidence: first, we demonstrated that EZH2 interacts with cullin 1 exclusively among seven different cullin members tested. Secondly, endogenous EZH2 levels accumulate upon cullin1 silencing. Third, EZH2 binds to β-TrCP exclusively among eight different F-box proteins tested. Binding to β-TrCP requires an intact substrate-binding domain of the E3 ligase. In addition, the half-life of the EZH2 protein is prolonged by siRNA-mediated β-TrCP silencing. Correspondingly, expression of the dominant-negative mutant of β-TrCP significantly reduced EZH2 ubiquitination. Further, the interaction of β-TrCP with EZH2 is phosphorylation dependent and this phosphorylation is mediated on a tyrosine residue (Y641) by Jak2, and finally, the cellular levels of EZH2 and its methyl transferase activity can be controlled by modulation of β-TrCP levels.  In summary, we identify a previously undescribed Jak2–β-TrCP–EZH2 axis in the regulation of H3K27me. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that a recurrently mutated site in lymphoid cancer (Y641) is phosphorylated and this phosphorylation mediated by Jak2 tyrosine kinase is critical for interaction of βTrCP with EZH2 and that mutations at this site confer increased stability to the EZH2 protein with attendant hyperactive H3K27me activity (Figure 5d). We speculate that being in the PRC2 complex, EZH2 is protected from recognition by β-TrCP either by steric hindrance or masking of degron by other components of PRC2 complex.7, 37 It is possible that phosphorylation of degron site (Y641) by Jak2 might cause conformational changes in EZH2, leading to either disruption of the PRC2 holoenzyme complex and/or exposure of degron to be recognized by β-TrCP for consequent degdradation. This study opens up a potential new avenue to examine the changes in molecular architecture of PRC2 complex in order for it to be rearranged/degraded in specific cellular contexts. Recognition of this newly identified mechanism might help in design potential novel therapeutic approaches for clinical management of cancers driven by aberrant accumulation/function of EZH2.

(d) A model of regulation of EZH2 stability. We propose that Jak2-mediated EZH2 Y641 phosphorylation promotes its interaction with SCFβ-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase, which in turn initiates the polyubiquitination of EZH2. This sequence of events results in proteasomal degradation of EZH2.  Epigenetic alterations are important during carcinogenesis, and earlier studies suggested that global histone modification levels are predictive for patients’ outcome in various tumor entities.  We demonstrate that H3K27me1 and H3K27me3 are markers of progression-free survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma. OBJECTIVE  • To evaluate if histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation plays a role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissue and whether its expression is a predictor of cancer recurrence in RCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS  • A tissue microarray (TMA) with 193 RCC specimens (comprising 142 clear-cell, 31 papillary, 10 chromophobe and 10 sarcomatoid RCC), 10 oncocytoma tissue specimens and a TMA with 30 benign renal tissue samples were stained with antibodies against H3K27-monomethyl (H3K27me1), H3K27-dimethyl (H3K27me2) and H3K27-trimethyl (H3K27me3).  • Sections were scored according to staining intensity and the proportion of epithelial cells showing nuclear staining.  • H3K27 methylation levels were correlated with established clinical-pathological variables (tumour-node-metastasis [TNM] stage, Fuhrman grade) and progression-free/cancer-specific survival. RESULTS  • H3K27me1/-me2/-me3 staining was significantly more intense in papillary RCC then in clear-cell RCC.  • H3K27me3 levels were higher in oncocytoma than in RCC.  • H3K27me1/-me2/-me3 methylation levels were inversely correlated with Fuhrman grading and pT-stage.  • Global H3K27me1/-me2/-me3 methylation levels were always higher in benign renal tissue than in RCC with tumour relapse (H3K27me1 P < 0.001, H3K27me2 P= 0.032, H3K27me3 P= 0.004).  • Progression-free survival was shorter in patients with lower levels of H3K27me1 and H3K27me3 in the univariate analysis. The newly created H3K27me score (combining the staining levels of the single modifications) was a significant and independent predictor of RCC progression-free survival. CONCLUSION  • The present study on H3K27-methylation supports the hypothesis that global histone modifications are potential markers of cancer prognosis in RCC. One reason could be that decreased H3K27 indicates transcriptional activation and therefore predicts cancer activation.

INTRODUCTION  The incidence and mortality rates of RCC have increased in recent years with 57 760 new cases and 12 980 deaths in 2009 [1]. The clinical outcomes of patients with RCC depend mainly on TNM stage, Fuhrman grade and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status [2], however, patients with RCC with similar tumour characteristics still show heterogeneity in their outcome. Approximately 50% of patients with RCC develop metastases and have a very poor survival rate (<5–15%) [1]. This emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of RCC, which would lead to better tools to predict the outcome of the disease.  DNA methylation and histone modifications are major epigenetic mechanisms involved in gene regulation and are frequently altered in carcinogenesis [3]. Previous research in RCC epigenetics has focused on DNA methylation and it has been shown that cancer cell DNA is generally hypomethylated [4]. Hypermethylation of the CpG island of a tumour suppressor gene has been identified as an important step in renal cell carcinogenesis [5] but, so far, histone modifications have been less comprehensively studied despite the fact that changes in DNA methylation are closely related to histone alterations.  A variety of post-translational modifications occur on the N-terminal tail of histones. These modifications include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, ADP-ribosylation and deimination [6]. The modifications function either by disrupting chromatin contacts or by affecting the recruitment of various proteins to the chromatin and thereby regulating transcription. For example, histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) monomethyl (H3K27me1), histone H3- (H3Ac) and histone H4 lysine acetylation (H4Ac) have been linked with transcriptional activity, whereas histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9), H3K2727 dimethyl (H3K27me2), H3K27 trimethyl (H3K27me3) and histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) have been linked with transcriptional repression. In addition, histone lysine methylation can be found in the form of mono- (me1), di- (me2), and trimethylation (me3), and an increasing number of methylation marks may intensify its activating or repressive character [6,7]. These modifications are dynamic and multiple enzymes that add or remove methylation marks have been identified [8].  Histone modifications can also be assessed using immunohistochemistry at the whole nuclei level of cancer cells; it was first shown by Seligson et al. [9] that global levels of both H3K4me2 and histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18Ac) are predictors of biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer. Accumulation of H3K4me1 also predicts PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy [10]. Later, prognostic relevance of global histone modification levels was also reported for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, who have a better survival with high H3K4me2 or low H3K9Ac levels [11]. Global H3K9Ac levels were used to identify patients with low grade bladder cancer with disease recurrence after transurethral resection of the bladder [12]. Some histone modifications have also been analysed in RCC: H3K4me2 and H3K18Ac were independent predictors of RCC mortality [13]. Lower global levels of total H3Ac [14] and H3K9Ac [15], respectively, were reported in RCC patients with a high Fuhrman grade. Progression-free survival and cancer-specific survival periods were shorter in patients with low levels of H3K4 [16].  So far, global H3K27 methylation levels have not been systematically investigated in RCC. To clarify whether these modifications have a potential diagnostic and prognostic role, we performed immunohistochemistry to assess H3K27 mono, di- and tri-methylation levels in a tissue microarray (TMA) with 193 RCC specimens. We then correlated global H3K27 modification levels with clinical-pathological variables and patient outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS  PATIENTS AND TMAS  The present study comprised 193 patients with RCC who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy. Surgery was performed at the Departments of Urology at the Universitätsklinikum Bonn, Germany and the Waldkrankenhaus Bonn, Germany between 1994 and 2008. All samples were randomly chosen from our tissue bank. Follow-up information was available for 117 patients. Disease progression was present in 36 patients and 16 died from RCC. We created a TMA with 30 cores from benign renal tissue. This tissue was sampled from the healthy part of tumour nephrectomy kidneys. The mean follow-up time was 66 months (median 51 months).  All patients were re-evaluated by a panel of uropathologists to determine the histological subtype, histopathological stage and Fuhrman grade. The RCC tissue comprised clear-cell RCC (ccRCC; n= 142), papillary RCC (pRCC; n= 31), chromophobe RCC (chRCC, n= 10) and sarcomatoid RCC (sRCC, n= 10). The pRCC samples were also classified into the subgroups pRCC type 1 (n= 18) and pRCC type 2 (n= 13). In addition, 10 oncocytoma samples were used. The TMA was prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens using a manual device (Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). Three tissue cores were arrayed to obtain a representative image of the tumour. The study was approved by the local ethics board. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY  Paraffin sections (5 µm) were cut from the TMA block and used within 1 week. Deparaffinization was done using xylene and the sections were rehydrated with graded ethanol. Slides were placed in target retrieval solution (citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and heated for 10 min at boiling temperature (microwave, 600 W). After cooling for 15 min, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by treatment with 3% H2O2 for 10 min. The sections were washed with tris-buffered saline. After a 15-min protein block with normal swine serum, the primary antibodies H3K27me1 (dilution: 1:1000; Lot ♯ JBC1395546, Catalogue ♯ 07-448, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), H3K27me2 (dilution: 1:200; Lot ♯ 32530, Catalogue ♯ 07-452, Millipore) and H3K27me3 (dilution: 1:200; Lot ♯ DAM1421462, Catalogue ♯ 07-449, Millipore) were applied overnight at 4 °C. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the labelled-streptavidine-biotin-peroxidase complex technique (LSAB, DAKO Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The biotin-conjugated secondary antibody was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, as was the avidin biotin enzyme reagent. The peroxidase was developed with the AEC system (DAKO Cytomation). The sections were counterstained with haematoxylin and mounted (Fig. 1).  Figure 1.  Figure 1.  Open in figure viewer Immunohistochemical staining of A, H3K27me1; B, H3K27me2; C, H3K27me3 in ccRCC. Original magnification ×400. Immunostaining results were evaluated using the Remmele scoring system [17]. The number of positive epithelial cells was estimated per core and scaled (0, no positive cells; 1, 1–25% positive cells; 2, 26–50% positive cells; 3, 51–75% positive cells; and 4, 76–100% positive cells). These scores were multiplied with an intensity scale (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, intensive staining). Three cores were evaluated in each patient. Evaluation of immunohistochemical staining was performed without knowledge of the clinical-pathological variables. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  Clinical-pathological variables were correlated with the global H3K27 methylation levels using the Spearman–Rho test, the Mann–Whitney U-test and the Kruskal–Wallis test, as appropriate. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to correlate the period of progression-free survival and cancer-specific survival after surgery with H3K27 methylation levels/clinical-pathological variables. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences program (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA); a P value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS  DISTRIBUTION OF H3K27 METHYLATION LEVELS IN HISTOLOGICAL RCC SUBTYPES AND NORMAL RENAL TISSUE  First, we analysed the distribution of H3K27 methylation levels among the histological subtypes (Table 1): H3K27me1 levels were mostly low throughout all histological subtypes; only the pRCC samples had slightly higher staining scores and this difference was significant (ccRCC vs pRCC: P= 0.011, Mann–Whitney U-test). H3K27me2 levels were unevenly distributed in the histological subtypes: pRCC samples frequently displayed higher H3K27me2 levels, whereas the other subtypes predominantly showed weak or moderate staining. These differences were significant (ccRCC vs pRCC: P < 0.001; pRCC vs chRCC: P= 0.003; pRCC vs sRCC: P < 0.001). H3K27me3 levels were generally high in all subtypes, but ccRCC samples showed somewhat lower levels (ccRCC vs pRCC: P= 0.018; ccRCC vs chRCC: P= 0.012). For the pRCC subtypes, no differences could be found for H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3. Global H3K27me1/-me2 methylation levels were mostly similar in oncocytoma and RCC, but H3K27me3 levels were significantly higher in oncocytoma than in RCC (P= 0.027). Global H3K27me1/-me2/-me3 methylation levels were always higher in benign renal tissue than in RCC with tumour relapse (H3K27me1: P < 0.001; H3K27me2: P= 0.032; H3K27me3: P= 0.004). No significant association could be seen when comparing benign renal tissue with RCC without tumour relapse (H3K27me1: P= 0.135; H3K27me2: P= 0.337; H3K27me3: P= 0.577; Fig. 2). We also compared H3K27methylation with H3K4me and histone acetylation, which was reported in an earlier study [16,18]. All H3K27 methylation marks were significantly associated with H3K4me1, H4K4me2, H3K4me3, H4Ac, H3Ac, H3K9Ac, H3K18Ac (all P < 0.001, Spearman–Rho test; Table 2[16,18])  Table 1.

We observed that adverse clinical-pathological parameters were associated with lower levels of H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3. Patients with higher pathological T-stage had decreasing levels of H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 (pT1a > pT1b > pT2 > pT3/4; all P < 0.001). An increasing Fuhrman grade (grade 1 > grade 2 > grade 3/4; all P≤ 0.005) was associated with lower levels of H3K27me1, H2k27me2 and H3K27me3. The decreasing levels of global H3K27 methylation were associated with vasculary invasion (all P≤ 0.001) or with the presence of distant metastasis (H3K27me3; P= 0.007). Lymph node metastasis was not associated with H3K27 methylation (P= 0.15–0.53). H3K27 methylation was not associated with gender (P= 0.057–0.788) or age (P= 0.405–589; Spearman–Rho test; Table 3).

The analyses showed that low levels of H3K27me1 (P= 0.021) and H3K27me3 (P= 0.012) were significant predictors of progression-free survival in the univariate model; however, H3K27 methylation levels failed to reach significance (P < 0.05) in the multivariate model, which also included TNM staging and the Fuhrman grade. H3K27me1 also significantly predicted cancer-specific survival in the univariate (P= 0.047, Fig. 3) but not in the multivariate model (P= 0.142).  Figure 3.  Figure 3.  Open in figure viewer Kaplan–Meier estimates for global H3K27 methylation: low global levels on H3K27me1 and H2K27me3 are significant predictors of progression-free survival as shown in Kaplan Meier estimates. Low global levels on H3K27me1 is a significant predictor for cancer specific survival. To evaluate the impact of all three methylation marks, we determined the H3K27me score: since Remmele scores [17] were unevenly distributed in H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3, a simple addition of the scores would not be useful. We therefore decided to calculate a threshold that distinguished patients with and without RCC progression most accurately using receiver–operator characteristic analysis (H3K27me1 ≤ 1; H3K27me2 ≤ 11; H3K27me3 ≤ 5). A Remmele score below the threshold was scored with 1, and the sum of all three modifications was termed the H3K27me score. This score was significantly associated with progression-free survival (P= 0.001) and cancer-specific mortality (P= 0.004) in the univariate model (Fig. 3). In the multivariate model, which included TNM staging and the Fuhrman grade, significance was also reached for the prediction of progression-free survival (P= 0.032). As expected, the established parameters of TNM-staging and Fuhrman grading significantly predicted progression-free survival and cancer-specific mortality (P < 0.001, Cox regression analysis). DISCUSSION  Epigenetic alterations play an important role in carcinogenesis. Knowledge of histone modifications as established regulators in the transcriptional regulation has emerged in the last few years: in general, histone lysine acetylation is associated with transcriptional activity. By contrast, the effect of histone lysine methylation is more complex. Current thinking is that transcriptional activation or repression depends on the specific position of histone methylation. The degree of activation or repression is further influenced by the number of methylation residues [6]. Previous studies focused mostly on histone acetylation, and did not systematically explore the role of H3K27 methylation. We therefore examined the global level of H3K27 mono-, di- and trimethylation in patients with RCC.  We showed that differential histone methylation (H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H2K27me3) was associated with clinical-pathological variables. Advanced pT-stage, increased Fuhrman-grade and vascular invasion were associated with decreasing levels of H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 methylation. Patients with distant metastases had significantly lower H3K27me3 levels. Global H3K27me1/-me2/-me3 methylation levels were always higher in benign renal tissue than in RCC with tumour relapse, which supports our hypothesis that H3K27 indicates transcriptional activation and therefore predicts cancer activation.  Low levels of H3K27 methylation were also predictive of a shorter period of progression-free survival (H3K27me1 and H3K27me3) and cancer-specific survival (H3K27me1) in the univariate model. However, the H3K27 methylation levels failed to reach significance in the multivariate model which included TNM staging and the Fuhrman grade. In contrast, the H3K27me score, which combined the different degrees of methylation at lysine 27, was an independent and significant predictor of recurrence-free survival. The higher predictive value of the ‘global’ H3K27me score in RCC could be attributable to a better representation of cumulating epigenetic alterations during cancer progression. It should be noted that the statistical power for a multivariate analysis with up to six variables in a cohort of 117 patients is limited, and future validation of our findings in a larger data set is necessary.  The concept that histone modifications are a prognostic marker is supported by several other studies: low levels of H3K4me2 and H3K18Ac have been shown to be predictive of cancer-specific survival in patients with localized RCC [13]. It should be noted that, in this latter study, in a multivariate Cox-model that included grade, Ki-67 and p53 expression, the histone modifications remained a significant predictor of cancer-specific survival, which was no longer the case when ECOG performance status was included [13]. The smaller series published by Minardi et al. [15] and Kanao et al. [14] showed lower levels of H3Ac and H3K9Ac in poorly differentiated RCC specimens.  We have previously also studied histone H3K4 methylation and H3/H4/H3K9/H3K18-acetylation in patients with RCC [16,18]. The staining scores for histone methylation and acetylation were significantly associated with each other. The association of histone modification with acetylation suggests possible epigenetic confusion in RCC cells, resulting from aberrant activity and/or expression of histone-modifying enzymes.  Our results indicate an excess of H3K27 demethylases compared with methylases resulting in lower H3K27 methylation levels in RCC and an unfavourable clinical course. So far, only one H3K27 methylase (EZH2) and two H3K27 demethylases (JMJD3 and UTX) have been identified in the human. EZH2 was shown to be overexpressed in RCC [19], whereas the expression of JMJD3 and UTX remains unstudied. However, recent studies indicate a role for the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway in the regulation of histone modifications. Accumulation of HIF1α is common in RCC, and associated with poor prognosis [20]. Many jumonji-domain histone demethylases harbour a HIF1α -binding site, and JMJD3 and UTX are both activated by HIF1α in a hypoxic environment [21]. It was shown for the HIF1α-regulated H3K9 demethylase JMJD1A that it acts as a signal amplifier to facilitate hypoxic gene expression and finally enhances tumour growth [22]. It should also be considered that the list of human H3K27 methylases/demethylases is likely to be lengthened in the future. For example, novel H3K27me1-demethylases (ATXR5, ATXR6) have been recently discovered in Arabidopsis thaliana[23]. Histone modifications are dynamic and could be targets for future medical therapy. Our data showed that methylation levels of H3K27me3 are higher than H3K27me2. We also found, that the methylation levels of H3K27me1 are lower than H3K27me2. These data support the hypothesis that more histone lysine methylases than demethylases are to be found in RCC. Earlier studies have shown that reduced global levels of histone modifications (H4K20me3 in leukaemia cells [24]) were mainly attributable to loss at repetitive DNA sequences (e.g. subtelomeric repetitive element D4Z4; acromcentric chromosomal region NBL2, juxtacentromeric satellite element Sat2), and not to loss in specific tumour suppressor genes or oncogenes; DNA hypomethylation in repetitive regions contributes to chromosomal instability [25]. We assume that loss of histone methylation may also cause genomic instability.  We also investigated the distribution of H3K27 methylation levels in tumours with different histological subtypes. As expected, there were few papillary, chromophobe or sarcomatoid differentiation patterns as a consequence of their low incidence. For these low numbers (pRCC n= 31, chRCC n= 10, sRCC n= 10) it is difficult to perform powerful statistical analyses. Nevertheless we found significant lower levels of H3K27methylation levels in ccRCC than in pRCC. Also, global H3K27me3 methylation levels in oncocytoma were significantly higher than in RCC. Previously Kanao et al. [14] reported in a small study that H3K9Ac levels were lower in RCC than in non-malignant adjacent tissue. He also suggested that ccRCC patients have lower levels of H3K9Ac than do pRCC patients, but a very low number of cases made significant conclusions impossible.  To investigate whether alterations in histone modifications occur in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we measured histone H3/ H4 acetylation and H3K4/H3K27 methylation levels, as well as the expression of chromatin modifier genes in tumor and healthy esophageal tissue from ESCC patients. We found evidence of global H3 and H4 hypoacetylation, H3K4 and H3K27 hypermethylation in ESCC tissue. Both H3 hypoacetylation and H3K27 hypermethylation correlated with the severity and histological differentiation of the tumor, and H3K4 hypermethylation also correlated with tumor differentiation. Our results suggest that aberrant histone modifications may play an important role in the development and progression of ESCC.  Keywords: : Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, Histone, Acetylation, Methylation, Post-translational modification INTRODUCTION  Esophageal carcinoma is the eighth most common cancer in the world, and survival rates are low (1 Kamangar F, Dores GM, Anderson WF. Patterns of cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence across five continents: defining priorities to reduce cancer disparities in different geographic regions of the world. J Clin Oncol 2006;24(14):2137–2150. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). On the basis of etiological and pathological characteristics, esophageal carcinomas can be separated into two main types, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) (2 Enzinger PC, Mayer RJ. Esophageal cancer. N Engl J Med 2003;349(23):2241–2252. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). While the incidence of EAC is on the rise in Western countries, ESCC remains the predominant form of esophageal cancer in Asia (3 Pohl H, Welch HG. The role of overdiagnosis and reclassification in the marked increase of esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence. J Natl Cancer Inst 2005;97(2):142–146. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Approximately three quarters of all EACs are found in the distal esophagus, whereas ESCCs are more evenly distributed throughout the middle and lower third of the esophagus (2 Enzinger PC, Mayer RJ. Esophageal cancer. N Engl J Med 2003;349(23):2241–2252. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] , 4 Siewert JR, Stein HJ, Feith M, Bruecher BL, Bartels H, Fink U. Histologic tumor type is an independent prognostic parameter in esophageal cancer: lessons from more than 1,000 consecutive resections at a single center in the Western world. Ann Surg 2001;234(3):360–367; discussion 368–369. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). The development of these tumors is strongly associated with a number of dietary and environmental factors, such as alcohol consumption, smoking, and high level of nitrates in the soil and drinking water (5 Morita M, Kuwano H, Ohno S, Sugimachi K, Seo Y, Tomoda H, Furusawa M, Nakashima T. Multiple occurrence of carcinoma in the upper aerodigestive tract associated with esophageal cancer: reference to smoking, drinking and family history. Int J Cancer 1994;58(2):207–210. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Although surgical removal of the tumor is currently the most commonly employed treatment option for patients with esophageal carcinoma, the success of surgery depends strongly on early diagnosis and current screening methods. The principal screen for these types of cancers is the TNM staging system that scores tumors on the basis of radiological and clinical features. The utility of this screen is limited, however, by high cost and poor detection sensitivity for early stage esophageal carcinomas (6 Tomizawa Y, Wang KK. Screening, surveillance, and prevention for esophageal cancer. Gastroenterol Clin North Am 2009;38(1):59–73, viii. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Thus, the development of alternative screening methods, including those that test for genetic and epigenetic markers of the disease, would improve the clinical management of esophageal carcinomas and improve patient outcomes.  Multiple studies have demonstrated that specific epigenetic alterations are important features of cancer development. For example, a growing body of evidence indicates that aberrant DNA methylation is involved in the tumorigenesis of lung (7, 8 Paliwal A, Vaissiere T, Krais A, Cuenin C, Cros MP, Zaridze D, Moukeria A, Boffetta P, Hainaut P, Brennan P, Herceg Z. Aberrant DNA methylation links cancer susceptibility locus 15q25.1 to apoptotic regulation and lung cancer. Cancer Res 2010;70(7):2779–2788. Kreisler A, Strissel PL, Strick R, Neumann SB, Schumacher U, Becker CM. Regulation of the NRSF/REST gene by methylation and CREB affects the cellular phenotype of small-cell lung cancer. Oncogene 2010;29(43):5828–5838.   ), esophagus (9, 10 Vasavi M, Ponnala S, Gujjari K, Boddu P, Bharatula RS, Prasad R, Ahuja YR, Hasan Q. DNA methylation in esophageal diseases including cancer: special reference to hMLH1 gene promoter status. Tumori 2006;92(2):155–162. Long C, Yin B, Lu Q, Zhou X, Hu J, Yang Y, Yu F, Yuan Y. Promoter hypermethylation of the RUNX3 gene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer Invest 2007;25(8):685–690.   ), thymic epithelium (11 Chen C, Yin B, Wei Q, Li D, Hu J, Yu F, Lu Q. Aberrant DNA methylation in thymic epithelial tumors. Cancer Invest 2009;27(5):582–591. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ) and other tissues (12 Kulis M, Esteller M. DNA methylation and cancer. Adv Genet 2010;70:27–56. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). In addition, modifications to histones at N-terminal histone tails that protrude from the nucleosomes are recognized as genomic markers of genes undergoing epigenetic deregulation in disease. At least eight histone modifications have been identified, among which acetylation and methylation are the most commonly studied. Histone acetylation and methylation are both reversible events that can either disrupt chromosomal contacts or affect nonhistone protein interactions with chromatin, thus altering chromatin structure and rates of transcription (13 Vialou V. Histone acetylation, gene regulation and depression. Med Sci (Paris) 2010;26(5):465–467. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylase (HDACs) acetylate and deacetylate lysine residues of histone proteins, and thereby regulate the access of many transcriptional factors to DNA and consequently enhance or inhibit gene expression. Evidence suggests that the overall acetylation state of histone proteins correlates with transcriptional activity, with hypoacetylation states suppressing transcription and hyperacetylation states conferring increased transcriptional activity (14 Schubeler D, Lorincz MC, Cimbora DM, Telling A, Feng YQ, Bouhassira EE, Groudine M. Genomic targeting of methylated DNA: influence of methylation on transcription, replication, chromatin structure, and histone acetylation. Mol Cell Biol 2000;20(24):9103–9112. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ).  Table 1  Characteristics of 30 Patients with ESCC   CSVDisplay Table Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and demethylases are enzymes that catalyze the addition and removal of histones methyl groups (15 Peterson CL, Laniel MA. Histones and histone modifications. Curr Biol 2004;14(14):R546–R551. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Lysine residues in histone H3 can be mono, di, or trimethylated. Previous studies demonstrate that methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) and H3K27 is associated with transcriptional repression, whereas methylation at H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79 is associated with transcriptional activation (15 Peterson CL, Laniel MA. Histones and histone modifications. Curr Biol 2004;14(14):R546–R551. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Furthermore, H3K4 methylation is associated with euchromatin function, and H3K27 methylation is involved in X-chromosome inactivation (16 Plath K, Fang J, Mlynarczyk-Evans SK, Cao R, Worringer KA, Wang H, de la Cruz CC, Otte AP, Panning B, Zhang Y. Role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in X inactivation. Science 2003;300(5616):131–135. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ).  In esophageal carcinoma, hypermethylation of histone H4 has been observed in the early stage of tumor development and this change correlates with aberrant expression of HDAC1, indicating that abnormal histone modifications play important roles in the development of the disease (17 Toh Y, Yamamoto M, Endo K, Ikeda Y, Baba H, Kohnoe S, Yonemasu H, Hachitanda Y, Okamura T, Sugimachi K. Histone H4 acetylation and histone deacetylase 1 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Oncol Rep 2003;10(2):333–338. [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). However, the regulation of histone modifications and chromatin modifier genes in ESCC has not been thoroughly studied. In this study, we investigated global methylation and acetylation patterns on histone H3 and H4, as well as the expression of 16 members of three classes of chromatin modifier genes in ESCC and healthy esophageal tissue. Among these parameters, we found a number significant alterations and uncovered corelationships between specific changes in epigenetic factors and chromatin modifier gene expression.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Tissue samples  Fresh frozen ESCC samples and paired control esophageal tissue samples (healthy surrounding esophageal tissue more than 5 cm away from tumor) were obtained from 30 ESCC patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China. The 18 male and 12 female patients ranged between 50 and 71 years of age (mean 58.8 ± 5.59 years) and all had undergone ESCC surgery between May and November 2009. None of the patients had received preoperative treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Control samples were histologically confirmed as healthy esophageal tissues, while all tumor samples were histologically and pathologically confirmed as ESCC, and staged according to the TNM system (18 Thompson SK, Ruszkiewicz AR, Jamieson GG, Esterman A, Watson DI, Wijnhoven BP, Lamb PJ, Devitt PG. Improving the accuracy of TNM staging in esophageal cancer: a pathological review of resected specimens. Ann Surg Oncol 2008;15(12):3447–3458. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Only samples with a tumor cell content of more than 80% were included in this study. A summary of clinical and pathological characteristics of patients included in this study is presented in Table 1. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the second Xiangya Hospital.  RNA isolation and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR)  Total RNA was isolated from primary ESCC tissue using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) and stored at −80°C. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the One Step SYBR® PrimeScriptTM RT-PCR Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Dalian, China) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Primers used are listed in Table 2.

PowerPoint slideOriginal jpg (109.00KB)Display full size Detection of histone acetylation and methylation levels  Histone extraction and measurement of global histone H3/H4 acetylation, as well as global H3K4 and H3K27 methylation levels were performed using the EpiQuikTM global histone H3/H4 acetylation, and H3K4/H3K27 methylation assay kits, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Epigentek Group Inc., NY, USA). Briefly, histone proteins were stably spotted on strip wells. Acetylated histone H3/H4 and methylated histone H3K4/H3K27 levels were detected with highaffinity antibodies. Signals were developed using a horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies and quantified by measuring absorbance at 450 nm. Histone protein concentrations were measured with the BCATM Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).  Statistical analysis  Data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) and are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Student's t-test was used to compare continuous variables and Pearson's correlation test was used for correlation analyses. p values of less than .05 were considered significant.  RESULTS  Histone acetylation and methylation levels were measured in 30-paired samples of tumor and healthy esophageal tissue from patients with ESCC. We found that global histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels were reduced in tumor tissue compared with healthy control tissue [H3: p = .031; H4: p = .042; Figure 1(a)], whereas levels of methylated H3K4 and H3K27 were increased in tumor tissue compared with control tissue [H3K4: p = .001; H3K27: p = .002; Figure 1(b)]. The degree of both H3 hypoacetylation and H3K27 hypermethylation correlated with the severity of the tumor, as measured by TNM staging [H3 acetylation: p < .001; H3K27 methylation: p = .019; Figure 1(c)]. Furthermore, the degree of H3 hypoacetylation as well as H3K4 and H3K27 hypermethylation correlated with the histological differentiation of the tumor [H3 acetylation: p < .01; H3K4 methylation: p < .05; H3K27 methylation: p < .05; Figure 1(d)]. Correlations between global histone acetylation/methylation levels and clinicopathological characteristics were also evaluated [Table 3(a)]. H4 hypoacetylation was found to correlate with a history of alcohol consumption (p = .015), whereas H3 hypoacetylation was found to correlate with lymphatic permeation (p = .005).  Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the expression of sixteen members of chromatin modifier genes. Using β-actin as an internal control to normalize for differences in the amount of total RNA present in each sample, the levels of HDAC1 (p = .004), HDAC2 (p = .001), HDAC5 (p = .001), SIRT1 (p = .015), SUV39H1 (p < .001), and EZH2 (p = .005) mRNA transcripts were found to be significantly increased in ESCC tumor tissue compared with control tissue. In contrast, LSD1 mRNA was significantly decreased in tumor tissue (p = .007; Figure 2).  Table 3(a)  (a).

In addition, we found that the level of HDAC2 and H3 acetylation were inversely related(r = −0.539; p = .002), as were HDAC5 and H4 acetylation levels were detected [r = −0.383, p = .036; Figures 3(a) and (b)]. EZH2 mRNA levels positively correlated with H3K27 methylation level [r = 0.844, p < .001; Figure 3(c)]. We also found a positive correlation between HDAC2 expression and lymphatic permeation (p = .023). The expression levels of the chromatin modifier genes assayed did not appear to correlate with gender, tumor size, history of alcohol consumption, family history of esophageal carcinoma or lymphatic involvement [Table 3(b)].  Table 3(b)  (b). Correlation of Histone Modification and Chromatin Modifier Genes Expression Patterns with Clinicopathological Characteristics of Patients with ESCC.   CSVDisplay Table DISCUSSION  Posttranslational histone modifications to histones have received much attention for their ability to alter the physical state of chromatin and regulate gene expression (13 Vialou V. Histone acetylation, gene regulation and depression. Med Sci (Paris) 2010;26(5):465–467. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Furthermore, many of and the chromatin modifier genes that mediate these modifications have been associated with the development of cancer (19 Esteller M. Cancer epigenomics: DNA methylomes and histone-modification maps. Nat Rev Genet 2007;8(4):286–298. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). For example, recent reports analyzing global patterns of histone modifications suggest that H3K27 methylation is involved in the progression of prostate, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and nonsmall cell lung cancers, and could potentially serve as a prognostic factor for some or all of these diseases (20–22 Seligson DB, Horvath S, Shi T, Yu H, Tze S, Grunstein M, Kurdistani SK. Global histone modification patterns predict risk of prostate cancer recurrence. Nature 2005;435(7046):1262–1266. Barlesi F, Giaccone G, Gallegos-Ruiz MI, Loundou A, Span SW, Lefesvre P, Kruyt FA, Rodriguez JA. Global histone modifications predict prognosis of resected non small-cell lung cancer. J Clin Oncol 2007;25(28):4358–4364. Martinez-Garcia E, Licht JD. Deregulation of H3K27 methylation in cancer. Nat Genet 2010;42(2):100–101.   ). H3K27 hypermethylation is also a determinant of the aggressiveness of cancer cells because it is associated with the repression of several tumor suppressor genes (22 Martinez-Garcia E, Licht JD. Deregulation of H3K27 methylation in cancer. Nat Genet 2010;42(2):100–101. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). It is generally recognized that the methylation of H3K27 leads to the recruitment of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes to nucleosomes of the nascent DNA strand, resulting in gene silencing (23–25 Hansen KH, Bracken AP, Pasini D, Dietrich N, Gehani SS, Monrad A, Rappsilber J, Lerdrup M, Helin K. A model for transmission of the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark. Nat Cell Biol 2008;10(11):1291–1300. Cao R, Wang H, He J, Erdjument-Bromage H, Tempst P, Zhang Y. Role of hPHF1 in H3K27 methylation and Hox gene silencing. Mol Cell Biol 2008;28(5):1862–1872. He LR, Liu MZ, Li BK, Rao HL, Liao YJ, Guan XY, Zeng YX, Xie D. Prognostic impact of H3K27me3 expression on locoregional progression after chemoradiotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. BMC Cancer 2009;9:461.   ). In this study, we observed elevated levels of H3K27 methylation in ESCC tissue compared with healthy esophageal tissue from the same individual. Further analysis revealed that H3K27 hypermethylation was closely associated with the histological differentiation and the tumor stage.  H3K27 methylation is catalyzed by the polycomb proteins, a group of genes that have been characterized as oncogenes and are frequently overexpressed in cancers. Their oncogenic potential is mainly mediated through H3K27 methylation and the resulting epigenetic inactivation of the INK4A-ARF pathway, which mainly encodes tumor suppressor genes such as p16/INK4A and p14/ARF, which are key regulators of cellular senescence (26 Chen H, Gu X, Su IH, Bottino R, Contreras JL, Tarakhovsky A, Kim SK. Polycomb protein Ezh2 regulates pancreatic beta-cell Ink4a/Arf expression and regeneration in diabetes mellitus. Genes Dev 2009;23(8):975–985. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). EZH2 (enhancer of Zeste homolog 2) is a polycomb group protein overexpressed in many cancer types, including breast, prostate and esophagus (27 Simon JA, Lange CA. Roles of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase in cancer epigenetics. Mutat Res 2008;647(1–2):21–29. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). In ESCCs, EZH2 expression and global hypermethylation of histone H3K27 are correlated with tumor stage and locoregional progression (25 He LR, Liu MZ, Li BK, Rao HL, Liao YJ, Guan XY, Zeng YX, Xie D. Prognostic impact of H3K27me3 expression on locoregional progression after chemoradiotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. BMC Cancer 2009;9:461. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Google Scholar] ). Our results confirm the relationship between EZH2 overexpression and H3K27 methylation levels in ESCC tissue, in a manner consistent with the observations published by Tzao and colleagues. (28 Tzao C, Tung HJ, Jin JS, Sun GH, Hsu HS, Chen BH, Yu CP, Lee SC. Prognostic significance of global histone modifications in resected squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Mod Pathol 2009;22(2):252–260. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). These findings indicate that the hypermethylation of H3K27 may promote the development and progression of ESCC.  Histones with trimethylated H3K4 are often clustered around transcriptional start sites, whereas histones with dimethylated H3K4 tend to be present throughout the coding region of transcribed genes (29, 30 Lee MG, Norman J, Shilatifard A, Shiekhattar R. Physical and functional association of a trimethyl H3K4 demethylase and Ring6a/MBLR, a polycomb-like protein. Cell 2007;128(5):877–887. Yamane K, Tateishi K, Klose RJ, Fang J, Fabrizio LA, Erdjument-Bromage H, Taylor-Papadimitriou J, Tempst P, Zhang Y. PLU-1 is an H3K4 demethylase involved in transcriptional repression and breast cancer cell proliferation. Mol Cell 2007;25(6):801–812.   ). Recent research showed that methylated H3K4 is expressed at varying frequencies in different carcinomas. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and stomach and neuroendocrine carcinomas, methylated H3K4 was frequently and highly expressed, whereas in hepatocellular carcinomas, it is less abundant. One reason for these distinct different levels of H3K4 methylation in different carcinomas could be the differential expression of opposing histone modification enzyme pairs, such as histone methylases and demethylases (31 Magerl C, Ellinger J, Braunschweig T, Kremmer E, Koch LK, Holler T, Buttner R, Luscher B, Gutgemann I. H3K4 dimethylation in hepatocellular carcinoma is rare compared with other hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal carcinomas and correlates with expression of the methylase Ash2 and the demethylase LSD1. Hum Pathol 2010;41(2):181–189. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). LSD1, one of the histone demethylases, is highly specic for mono and dimethylated H3K4 and functions as a transcriptional corepressor by removing methyl groups from the transcriptional activity-related H3K4 residue (32 Shi Y, Lan F, Matson C, Mulligan P, Whetstine JR, Cole PA, Casero RA. Histone demethylation mediated by the nuclear amine oxidase homolog LSD1. Cell 2004;119(7):941–953. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Transcriptional target analysis revealed that LSD1 regulates several cellular signaling pathways including TGFbeta1 signaling pathway that are critically involved in cell proliferation and survival, including TGF-β1 signaling. Wang and colleagues observed downregulation of LSD1 in breast carcinomas, and they also observed that the expression of LSD1 could inhibit the invasion of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo (33 Wang Y, Zhang H, Chen Y, Sun Y, Yang F, Yu W, Liang J, Sun L, Yang X, Shi L, Li R, Li Y, Zhang Y, Li Q, Yi X, Shang Y. LSD1 is a subunit of the NuRD complex and targets the metastasis programs in breast cancer. Cell 2009;138(4):660–672. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). In the current study, we observed a global increase in H3K4 methylation levels in ESCC tissue samples, as well as a positive relationship between levels of H3K4 methylation and tumor severity. Downregulation of LSD1 was also observed in ESCC tissues, indicating that H3K4 methylation may play an important role in the development of ESCC.  In this study, we report that histone H3 and H4 were hypoacetylated in ESCC tissue samples compared with healthy esophageal tissue from the same patient. In addition, we found that H3 hypoacetylation correlated with tumor stage and differentiation, suggesting that this epigenetic phenomenon is related to ESCC aggressiveness. ESCC has been linked to a number of environmental factors, including alcoholism. Interestingly, we found that hypoacetylation of histone H4 was more prevalent in patients with a history of alcohol consumption.  It has previously been demonstrated that levels of H4 acetylation and the aberrant expression of HDAC1 are frequently associated with ESCC (17 Toh Y, Yamamoto M, Endo K, Ikeda Y, Baba H, Kohnoe S, Yonemasu H, Hachitanda Y, Okamura T, Sugimachi K. Histone H4 acetylation and histone deacetylase 1 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Oncol Rep 2003;10(2):333–338. [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] , 34 Tzao C, Sun GH, Tung HJ, Hsu HS, Hsu WH, Wang YC, Cheng YL, Lee SC. Reduced acetylated histone H4 is associated with promoter methylation of the fragile histidine triad gene in resected esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Ann Thorac Surg 2006;82(2):396–401; discussion 401. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Interestingly, HDAC1 expression is decreased in esophageal carcinoma cells relative to healthy mucosa tissue, but is significantly increased in carcinoma cells that have invaded into the deeper layers of the esophagus wall. Furthermore, H4 histones are highly hyperacetylated in esophageal carcinoma cells during the early stages of cancer invasion. These results suggest that epigenetic changes to H4 acetylation levels are dynamic and are determinant of esophageal cancer development and progression. Furthermore, hyperacetylation of histone H4 and overexpression of HDAC1 have been detected together in single tumors, implying that a functional interaction may exist between these two processes (17 Toh Y, Yamamoto M, Endo K, Ikeda Y, Baba H, Kohnoe S, Yonemasu H, Hachitanda Y, Okamura T, Sugimachi K. Histone H4 acetylation and histone deacetylase 1 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Oncol Rep 2003;10(2):333–338. [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ).  It is recognized that HDAC activity is critical for the deacetylation of histone and nonhistone proteins, and HDACs are important regulators of gene expression patterns and cell proliferation associated with malignant transformation (35, 36 Minucci S, Pelicci PG. Histone deacetylase inhibitors and the promise of epigenetic (and more) treatments for cancer. Nat Rev Cancer 2006;6(1):38–51. Park JH, Jung Y, Kim TY, Kim SG, Jong HS, Lee JW, Kim DK, Lee JS, Kim NK, Bang YJ. Class I histone deacetylase-selective novel synthetic inhibitors potently inhibit human tumor proliferation. Clin Cancer Res 2004;10(15):5271–5281.   ). Specifically, HDAC2 is overexpressed in 76% of advanced gastric cancers (37 Song J, Noh JH, Lee JH, Eun JW, Ahn YM, Kim SY, Lee SH, Park WS, Yoo NJ, Lee JY, Nam SW. Increased expression of histone deacetylase 2 is found in human gastric cancer. APMIS 2005;113(4):264–268. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ) and HDAC1 is upregulated in 62% of lung cancers (38 Sasaki H, Moriyama S, Nakashima Y, Kobayashi Y, Kiriyama M, Fukai I, Yamakawa Y, Fujii Y. Histone deacetylase 1 mRNA expression in lung cancer. Lung Cancer 2004;46(2):171–178. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Similar results have been observed in prostate cancer (39 Wang L, Zou X, Berger AD, Twiss C, Peng Y, Li Y, Chiu J, Guo H, Satagopan J, Wilton A, Gerald W, Basch R, Wang Z, Osman I, Lee P. Increased expression of histone deacetylaces (HDACs) and inhibition of prostate cancer growth and invasion by HDAC inhibitor SAHA. Am J Transl Res 2009;1(1):62–71. [PubMed], [Google Scholar] ), colon cancer (40 Mariadason JM. HDACs and HDAC inhibitors in colon cancer. Epigenetics 2008;3(1):28–37. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ) and breast cancer (41 Fan J, Yin WJ, Lu JS, Wang L, Wu J, Wu FY, Di GH, Shen ZZ, Shao ZM. ER alpha negative breast cancer cells restore response to endocrine therapy by combination treatment with both HDAC inhibitor and DNMT inhibitor. J Cancer Res Clin Oncol 2008; 134(8):883–890. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). The deacetylase SIRT1 is also upregulated in a variety of cancer cell lines and tumors (42 Firestein R, Blander G, Michan S, Oberdoerffer P, Ogino S, Campbell J, Bhimavarapu A, Luikenhuis S, de Cabo R, Fuchs C, Hahn WC, Guarente LP, Sinclair DA. The SIRT1 deacetylase suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis and colon cancer growth. PLoS One 2008;3(4):e2020. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Google Scholar] ). SIRT1 deacetylates lysine residues in histones as well as in nonhistone proteins, including cancer-related factors; such as FoxO, p53, and NF-kB. This activity of SIRT1 is thought to play a key role in promoting cell survival under genotoxic and oxidative stresses (43, 44 Vinciguerra M, Santini MP, Claycomb WC, Ladurner AG, Rosenthal N. Local IGF-1 isoform protects cardiomyocytes from hypertrophic and oxidative stresses via SirT1 activity. Aging (Albany NY) 2010;2(1):43–62. Yi J, Luo J. SIRT1 and p53, effect on cancer, senescence and beyond. Biochim Biophys Acta 2010;1804(8):1684–1689.   ). In the current study, we observed that HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC5 and SIRT1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in ESCC samples compared with donor-matched healthy control tissue. Furthermore, the expression of HDAC1, HDAC2, and SIRT1 was significantly higher in stage III/IV tumors than that in stage I/II tumors, suggesting that the overexpression of these HDACs is involved in the progression of ESCC.  In our study, we found that abnormal histone acetylation and methylation levels in ESCC were closely correlated with tumor stage and histological differentiation. This finding indicates that analyzing changes in histone modification pattern may have potential applications in the diagnosis and prognosis estimation of ESCC. Studies using epigenetic drugs such as TSA, a HDAC inhibitor that can increase histone acetylation levels and re-establish the normal expression of regulatory genes silenced in cancers (40, 41 Mariadason JM. HDACs and HDAC inhibitors in colon cancer. Epigenetics 2008;3(1):28–37. Fan J, Yin WJ, Lu JS, Wang L, Wu J, Wu FY, Di GH, Shen ZZ, Shao ZM. ER alpha negative breast cancer cells restore response to endocrine therapy by combination treatment with both HDAC inhibitor and DNMT inhibitor. J Cancer Res Clin Oncol 2008; 134(8):883–890.   , 45 Stimson L, La Thangue NB. Biomarkers for predicting clinical responses to HDAC inhibitors. Cancer Lett 2009;280(2):177–183. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ), may provide new clues for the treatment of ESCC. In another example, Zhang and colleagues (46 Zhang B, Wang Y, Pang X. Enhanced radiosensitivity of EC109 cells by inhibition of HDAC1 expression. Med Oncol 2010; Epub ahead of print. ] [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ) showed that RNAi efficiently inhibits HDAC1 expression in ECa109 cells, effectively normalizing H3 acetylation levels and increasing the sensitivity to irradiation-dependent apoptosis. Additionally, Murakami and colleagues (47 Murakami K, Matsubara H, Hoshino I, Akutsu Y, Miyazawa Y, Matsushita K, Sakata H, Nishimori T, Usui A, Kano M, Nishino N, Yoshida M. CHAP31 induces apoptosis only via the intrinsic pathway in human esophageal cancer cells. Oncology 2010;78(1):62–74. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ) documented an anti-proliferative effect of CHAP31, a novel HDAC inhibitor, on ESCC cells.  In summary, our results demonstrated abnormal histone acetylation and methylation levels and expressions of chromatin modifier genes in ESCC, suggesting that aberrant histone modification may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ESCC. These findings provide new insight into the epigenetic pathogenesis of ESCC and the potential reversibility of these epigenetic abnormalities.  
1082||EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, catalyzes the mono- through trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27). Histone H3K27 trimethylation is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification. Point mutations of the EZH2 gene (Tyr641) have been reported to be linked to subsets of human B-cell lymphoma. The mutant allele is always found associated with a wild-type allele (heterozygous) in disease cells, and the mutations were reported to ablate the enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex for methylating an unmodified peptide substrate. Here we demonstrate that the WT enzyme displays greatest catalytic efficiency (kcat/K) for the zero to monomethylation reaction of H3K27 and diminished efficiency for subsequent (mono- to di- and di- to trimethylation) reactions. In stark contrast, the disease-associated Y641 mutations display very limited ability to perform the first methylation reaction, but have enhanced catalytic efficiency for the subsequent reactions, relative to the WT enzyme. These results imply that the malignant phenotype of disease requires the combined activities of a H3K27 monomethylating enzyme (PRC2 containing WT EZH2 or EZH1) together with the mutant PRC2s for augmented conversion of H3K27 to the trimethylated form. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a human disease that is dependent on the coordinated activities of normal and disease-associated mutant enzymatic function.  Keywords: cancer, enzymology, epigenetics Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a 4 or 5 protein complex that functionally represses gene transcription via posttranslational modification of the chromatin core protein, histone H3. More specifically, PRC2 functions as a histone methyltransferase, catalyzing the selective methylation of lysine residue 27 on histone H3 (H3K27). EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, catalyzing the mono- through trimethylation of H3K27. Trimethylation of H3K27 is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification.  Recently, somatic mutations of Tyr641 (Y641F, Y641N, Y641S, and Y641H) of EZH2 were reported to be associated with follicular lymphoma (FL) and the germinal-center B-cell like (GCB) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (1). In all cases, occurrence of the mutant EZH2 gene was heterozygous, and expression of both WT and mutant alleles was detected in the mutant samples profiled by transcriptome sequencing. It was also demonstrated that all of the mutant forms of EZH2 could be incorporated into the multiprotein PRC2 complex, but that the resulting complexes lacked the ability to catalyze methylation of the H3K27 equivalent residue of a peptidic substrate. Hence, it was concluded that the disease-associated changes at Tyr641 resulted in loss of function with respect to EZH2-catalyzed H3K27 methylation.  A presumptive reduction in the rate of H3K27 methylation due to enzyme heterozygosity seemed to us to be difficult to rationalize as the basis for a malignant phenotype (1, 2), especially in light of previous data indicating that overexpression of EZH2 (3–6), loss-of-function mutations in the corresponding H3K27 demethylase UTX (7), or overexpression of components of the PRC2, such as PHF19/PCL3 involved in increased H3K27 trimethylation (8–10), all result in malignant phenotypes in specific human cancers. Several recent reports indicate that an important component of early lymphomagenesis is the acquisition of stem cell-like characteristics (11, 12). Among these characteristics is enriched DNA methylation of PRC2 target genes, resulting in diminished transcription of these genes (13). Trimethylation of H3K27, catalyzed by the enzymatic activity of EZH2, similarly leads to diminished transcription of these same genes and has thus been reported as an additional, potential progenitor of lymphomagenesis (11–14). EZH2 levels have also directly been implicated in lymphogenesis. For example, Velichutina et al. (14) found that EZH2 mRNA level was directly correlated with cellular proliferation in primary germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tumors, whereas levels of many EZH2 target genes were negatively correlated with proliferation in these same tumors. Likewise, expression levels of EZH2 and the PRC1 component BMI1 have both been linked to lymphogenesis and the degree of malignancy of B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas (15). We were thus motivated to explore the enzymology of the EZH2 mutants in greater detail.  Go to: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Recombinant PRC2 complexes (16) were prepared with WT and Tyr641 mutant versions of human EZH2 (see Materials and Methods). Equal concentrations (nominally 8 nM, based on protein determinations) of each complex were initially tested for the ability to catalyze 3H-methyl transfer from labeled SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) to an unmodified peptide representing the amino acid sequence surrounding H3K27 (H3:21-44) or to native avian erythrocyte oligonucleosomes. As previously reported (1), we found that the WT enzyme displayed robust activity for methyl transfer to this peptidic substrate, but that none of the mutant enzymes displayed significant methyltransferase activity (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the previously reported data and that in Fig. 1A, we found that all of the mutant EZH2 constructs were active methyltransferases against the avian nucleosome substrate (Fig. 1B).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. B-cell lymphoma-associated mutants of EZH2 are active histone methyltransferases. In vitro methyltransferase activity of PRC2 complexes containing wild-type and various Y641 mutants of EZH2 was measured as (A) methyl transfer reactions using a peptide ... There are several potential explanations for the discordant activity of the mutant PRC2 complexes on peptide and nucleosome substrates. One possibility is that substrate recognition sites distal to the enzyme active site (i.e., exosites) are important determinants of substrate binding and turnover; these sites would engage complementary recognition elements on the nucelosome that are not available on small peptidic substrates. However, when Escherichia coli-expressed, recombinant human histone H3 was tested as a substrate for the WT and mutant PRC2 complexes, the resulting pattern of activity was identical to that seen for the peptide substrate (see Supporting Information); that is, the WT enzyme demonstrated robust methyltransferase activity against the H3 substrate, the Y641F mutant showed 7% the activity of WT complex, and all other mutants displayed ≤ 1% the activity of WT complex. Hence, exosite engagement seems an unlikely explanation for the current results. The nucleosome presents many lysine residues beyond H3K27 as potential sites of methylation that would not be present in the small peptidic substrate. Thus, another possibility is that mutation of Y641 alters the substrate specificity of EZH2 to result in methylation of lysine residues other than H3K27. This possibility is unlikely given the excellent agreement between mutant activity on small peptide and recombinant H3 protein substrates. To evaluate this possibility further, we tested the enzymatic activity of the WT and mutant PRC2 complexes against a panel of peptidic substrates that represent all possible lysine residues of histone H3 and histone H4 (see Materials and Methods). All of the enzyme forms showed significant activity only against peptides containing the equivalent of residue H3K27. The specific activity of the mutants, however, was greatly reduced relative to WT in the order WT≫Y641F > Y641S ∼ Y641H > Y641N, again consistent with previous reported findings. The nucleosomes isolated from the avian natural source represent an admixture of states of histone modification, including various states of H3K27 methylations as judged by Western blotting with H3K27 methylation specific antibodies. Hence, another possibility is that the Y641 mutants of EZH2 display differential activity against different methylation states of H3K27.  To understand further the enzymatic activity of these mutants, and to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between activity against peptidic and nucleosome substrates, we studied the ability of the enzyme forms to catalyze further methylation of various H3K27 methylation states in the context of the H3:21-44 peptide. As stated above, we found that all of the mutant enzymes were deficient catalysts of unmodified H3K27 peptide methylation, relative to the WT enzyme. To our surprise, however, all of the mutant enzymes were superior to the WT enzyme in catalyzing further methylation of the mono- and especially the dimethylated H3K27 peptides (Fig. 2). Thus, the data suggest that the WT enzyme is most efficient in catalyzing the zero to monomethylation reaction. The mutant enzymes are defective in catalyzing this initial step, but are more efficient than the WT enzyme in catalyzing the subsequent steps leading from monomethyl to di- and trimethyl H3K27.  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. PRC2 complexes containing mutant EZH2 preferentially catalyze di- and trimethylation of histone H3K27. (A) Methyltransferase activity of mutant and WT complexes on unmethylated peptide (open bars), monomethylated peptide (hatched bars), and dimethylated ... The origins of the differential substrate specificities of WT and mutant EZH2 were explored through steady-state enzyme kinetics. As summarized in Table 1, the mutations have minimal effects on ground-state substrate recognition, as demonstrated by the similar values of Km for nucleosome and of K1/2 for peptide substrates. In all cases the peptidic substrates displayed sigmoidal binding behavior; hence, the concentration of peptide resulting in half-maximal velocity is reported here as K1/2 instead of the more common Michaelis constant, Km (17). This sigmoidal behavior was seen only with peptidic substrates (i.e., nucleosome and recombinant histone substrates displayed classical Michaelis–Menten kinetics), and the origin of this effect is unclear at present. The SAM Km likewise displayed minimal variation among the enzyme forms, ranging from 208 ± 50 to 304 ± 64 nM. Instead, the differences in substrate utilization appear to have their origin in transition state recognition, as demonstrated by differences in kcat values among the enzymes for various substrates (Table 1); as a result, the catalytic efficiency, quantified as the ratio kcat/K (where K is either Km or K1/2, depending on substrate identity; see above), varies between the WT and mutant enzymes for different states of H3K27 methylation (Table 1).  Table 1. Table 1. Steady-state kinetic parameters for methylation reactions catalyzed by PRC2 containing wild-type or Y641 mutants of EZH2 The mutation of Y641 to F, N, H, or S in EZH2 may facilitate multiple rounds of H3K27 methylation by impacting the H-bonding pattern and/or steric crowding in the active site of the enzyme–bisubstrate ternary complex, affecting the formation of a proper water channel for deprotonation of the reacting lysine (18). This inference is drawn by analogy to the crystallographic and molecular dynamic simulation results seen for tyrosine mutation in the related protein lysine methyltransferases LSMT, Dim-5, and SET7/9. For example, when tyrosine 245 of recombinant SET7/9 was mutated to alanine, a change in substrate specificity, similar to what is reported here for EZH2 Y641 mutations, was observed (19). The ability of the Y245A mutant SET7/9 to methylate an unmodified 20-residue peptide, representing the sequence surrounding H3K4, was reduced to ca. 20% of the WT enzyme (20). At the same time, the ability of the Y245A mutant to further methylate H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 peptides was greatly augmented (ca. 7-fold and 5-fold, respectively) relative to the WT enzyme. In contrast to the present results, however, mutation of SET7/9 Y245 to phenylalanine did not enhance mono- to dimethylation nor di- to trimethylation of the peptide; rather, the Y245F mutant displayed minimal catalytic activity for all peptidic substrates. Similarly, the wild-type enzyme G9a can dimethylate H3K9 but is unable to perform the di- to trimethylation reaction. Yet, when tyrosine 1067 of G9a (analogous to Y641 of EZH2) is mutated to phenylalanine, the enzyme now gains the ability to trimethylate H3K9 (21). The tolerance for multiple Y641 mutations in EZH2 suggests that a release of steric crowding may allow greater access for proper alignment of the larger dimethyl lysine as the substrate for the di- to trimethylation reaction. Crystallographic analysis of the protein methyltransferases SET7/9 and G9a reveals that the side chain hydroxyls of the active site tyrosine residues are involved in H-bonding interactions directly with the amine of the methyl-accepting lysine, or indirectly through an intervening water molecule. Although the larger active site of the Y641 mutants is favorable for di- and trimethylation, the loss of the tyrosine hydroxyl hydrogen bond acceptor may result in an unfavorable orientation of the active site for initial methyl transfer to the lysine amine. A complete understanding of the molecular basis for the dramatic reduction in the ability of these mutant enzymes to perform the initial methylation reaction will require additional study.  The implications of the present results for human disease are made clear by the data summarized in Table 1. Cells heterozygous for EZH2 would be expected to display a malignant phenotype, due to the efficient formation of H3K27me1 by the WT enzyme and the efficient, subsequent transition of this progenitor species to abnormally high levels of H3K27me3 by the mutant enzyme form(s). We note that H3K27me1 formation is not exclusively dependent on WT-EZH2 catalysis. Knockout studies of EZH2 and of another PRC2 subunit, EED, have demonstrated H3K27me1 formation can be catalyzed by PRC2 complexes containing either EZH2 or the related protein EZH1, as the catalytic subunit (22). Hence, catalytic coupling between the mutant EZH2 species and PRC2 complexes containing either WT-EZH2 or WT-EZH1 would suffice to augment H3K27me3 formation and thus produce the attendant malignant phenotype. Our data therefore suggest that the malignant phenotype of FL and DLBCL of the GCB subtype, associated with expression of mutant forms of EZH2 (1), is the result of an overall gain of function with respect to formation of the trimethylated form of H3K27.  The steady-state kinetic parameters listed in Table 1 allow us to calculate the expected levels of different H3K27 methylation states for cells heterozygous for the various mutant EZH2 forms, relative to cells homozygous for the WT enzyme. To perform these simulations we made a number of simplifying assumptions: (i) that steady-state enzyme kinetics are relevant to PRC2-catalyzed H3K27 methylation in the cellular context and that all measurements are made at the same time point in cell growth; (ii) that the mutant and the WT enzyme are expressed at equal levels in heterozygous cells and that the total EZH2 level is equal in all cells; (iii) that the cellular concentration of SAM, relative to its Km, is saturating and does not change among the cells; (iv) that the cellular concentration of nucleosome is similar to its Km and likewise does not change among cells; (v) that EZH1 catalyzed methylation of H3K27 was insignificant and constant among the cells; and (vi) that any H3K27 demethylase activity was also constant among the cells. With these assumptions in place, we obtained the predictions illustrated in Fig. 3A for relative levels of H3K27me3 (Top), H3K27me2 (Middle), and H3K27me1 (Bottom). A clear pattern emerges from these simulations. The level of H3K27me3 increases relative to WT cells for all mutant-harboring cells, ranging from a 30% increase for the Y641H mutant to > 400% for the Y641N mutant. At the same time, the levels of H3K27me2 decrease to < 50% of WT for all of the mutants, and the levels of H3K27me1 are reduced by approximately half for all mutants, relative to WT. We then measured the relative levels of the H3K27 methylation states in B-cell lymphoma cell lines that are known to be homozygous for WT EZH2 (OCI-LY19) or heterozygous for EZH2 Y641N (DB, KARPAS 422, and SU-DHL-6) or EZH2 Y641F (WSU-DLCL2) by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). The pattern of relative H3K27 methylation states seen in Fig. 3B is in excellent agreement with the results of the simulations based on in vitro steady-state kinetic parameters, despite the crude assumptions used in the simulations and the use of a nonphysiological peptide surrogate as substrate. Thus, we observe increased H3K27me3 for all mutant-harboring cells relative to WT, decreased H3K27me2 for all mutant-harboring cells relative to WT, and decreased H3K27me1 for at least two of the four mutant cell lines. The near-comparable levels of H3K27me1 in WT and KARPAS 422 and SU-DHL-6 cells may reflect different expression levels of WT and mutant EZH2, different contributions of EZH1, or other factors not accounted for in our simulations. Nevertheless, the concordance between the predicted and experimental patterns of H3K27 methylation status is remarkable and supports our view that enzymatic coupling between WT and mutant EZH2 leads to increased H3K27me3, thus resulting in the malignant phenotype of cells that are heterozygous for these mutants.  Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Steady-state enzyme kinetics predicts the relative patterns of H3K27 methylation status in EZH2 WT and heterozygous mutant lymphoma cell lines. (A) Predicted relative levels of H3K27me3 (Top), H3K27me2 (Middle), and H3K27me1 (Bottom) for cells containing ... The foregoing interpretation of our data also helps to reconcile the existence of cancer-associated overexpression of EZH2 (3–6) or PRC2-associated proteins (e.g., PHF19/PCL3) (8–10) and also loss-of-function genotypes for the histone H3K27 demethylase UTX (7). Loss of UTX activity would be enzymatically equivalent to a gain of function for EZH2, in either situation resulting in greater steady-state levels of trimethylated H3K27 in cancer cells (Fig. 4). The mono-, di-, and trimethylation states of histone H3K27 are associated with different functions in transcriptional control. Histone H3K27 monomethylation is associated with active transcription of genes that are poised for transcription (23, 24). In contrast, trimethylation of histone H3K27 is associated with either transcriptionally repressed genes (23, 25) or genes that are poised for transcription when histone H3K4 trimethylation is in cis (26). Taken together, alterations in the PRC2 complex activity reported in cancer, including the Y641 mutation of EZH2, are predicted to result in an increase in the trimethylated state of histone H3K27 and to thus result in transcriptional repression.  Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Proposed mechanisms leading to aberrantly high levels of trimethylation on histone H3K27 in cancer include (A) mutation of Y641 in EZH2 resulting in a change in substrate preference from the nonmethylated to the mono- and dimethylated histone H3K27, ( ... EZH2 and other protein methyltransferases have been suggested to be attractive targets for drug discovery (27–29). The present data also suggest an experimental strategy for development of FL and GCB lymphoma-specific drugs. As the differences in substrate recognition between the WT and disease-associated mutants derive from transition state interactions, small molecule inhibitors that selectively mimic the transition state of the mutant EZH2 over that of the WT enzyme should prove to be effective in blocking H3K27 methylation in mutation-bearing cells. Inhibitors of this type would be expected to display a large therapeutic index, as target-mediated toxicity would be minimal for any cells bearing only the WT enzyme. Transition state mimicry has proved to be an effective strategy for drug design in many disease areas (17, 30). Whether or not sufficient differentiation between the transition states of the WT and mutant EZH2 enzymes can be designed into a small molecule drug remains to be determined.  In summary, the present results point to a critical dependency on enzymatic coupling between enzymes that perform H3K27 monomethylation and the mutant forms of EZH2, for pathogenesis in FL and the GCB subtype of DLBCL. This is an example of a human disease that is dependent on such coupling of catalytic activity between normal (H3K27me1) and disease-associated mutant (H3K27me2/3) enzymes. We are unaware of other examples of this mechanism of pathogenesis in human disease.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Recombinant 5-Component PRC2. Wild-type EZH2 (NM_004456) or Tyr641 mutants were coexpressed with wild-type AEBP2 (NM_153207), EED (NM_003797), SUZ12 (NM_015355), and RbAp48 (NM_005610) in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using a baculovirus expression system. An N-terminal FLAG tag on the EED was used to purify active PRC2 complex from cell lysates (BPS Bioscience, catalog number 51004). The purity of the final PRC2 preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining.  Recombinant Human Histone H3. Recombinant human histone H3.1, expressed in and purified from E. coli (catalog number M250S) was purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc.  H3, H4 Peptide Panel. A library consisting of 44 peptides of 15 amino acids each was synthesized by 21st Century Biochemicals. This peptide panel encompassed all of the amino acids of human histones H3 and H4 with 10 residue overlaps between consecutive peptide sequences. The N terminus of each peptide was appended with biotin, and the C termini were represented as the amide. Purity (> 95%) and identity were confirmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectral analysis.  For study of the H3K27 methylation status dependence of enzyme activity, peptides were synthesized representing the amino acid sequence of human H3 from residues 21–44 (H3:21–44) with lysine 27 represented as the unmodified, monomethylated, dimethylated, or trimethylated side chain amine. These peptides were purchased from New England Peptide with biotin appended to the C terminus of each peptide.  In Vitro Assays of PRC2 Methyltransferase Activity. Flashplate assay with peptide substrate. For initial comparison of WT and Y641 mutants of EZH2, biotinylated histone H3:21-44 peptide containing unmethylated K27 (New England Peptide), monomethylated K27 (Millipore), or dimethylated K27 (Millipore) at a concentration of 800 nM was combined with a mixture of SAM at 1,700 nM, and 300 nM tritiated SAM (PerkinElmer, Inc.). This substrate combination was then added to the PRC2 in assay buffer [20 mM N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine (Bicine), 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween20, 0.005% bovine skin gelatin (BSG), pH 7.6]. Reactions were allowed to proceed for the indicated time interval and then quenched by addition of excess cold SAM (600-μM final concentration). Quenched reaction mixtures were transferred to a streptavidin-coated Flashplate (PerkinElmer, catalog number SMP410), allowed to bind for 1 h, and then detected on a TopCount NXT HTS (PerkinElmer). Each time point represents the average of six individual reactions. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined under identical reaction conditions except that the concentration of peptide or SAM was varied, while at saturating conditions of the other substrate. Velocity was plotted as a function of varied substrate concentration and the data were fitted to the untransformed version of the Michaelis–Menten equation or the untransformed version of a sigmoidal kinetic equation (30) to calculate values of K and kcat (30). Standard errors of fitted parameters are listed in Table 1 and were used to construct the error bars illustrated in Fig. 2 B and C. Errors associated with kcat/K (Table 1) were calculated according to standard methods of error propogation; the fractional error of kcat/K was determined as  equation image	[1] where μkcat is the standard error of kcat and μK is the standard error of K.  Filterplate assay with histone and oligonucleosome. Chicken erythrocyte oligonucleosomes were purified as previously described (31). Nucleosomes or histones were combined with a mixture of SAM and tritiated SAM and added to PRC2 in assay buffer (20 mM Bicine, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween20, 0.005% BSG, pH 7.6). Reactions were run and quenched as above. Quenched reaction mixture was transferred to a glass fiber filterplate (Millipore, catalog number MSFBN6B) and washed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid and allowed to dry. Microscint Zero (30 μL) was added and tritium incorporation was detected on a TopCount. Steady-state parameters for reactions with nucelosomes were determined under identical reaction conditions except that the concentration of nucleosome or SAM was varied while at saturating conditions of the other substrate. Velocity was plotted as a function of varied substrate concentration and fitted to the untransformed version of the Michaelis–Menten equation to derive the values of Km and kcat as described above.  Evaluation of H3K27 methylation status in cells. The cell lines OCI-LY19 (ACC 528), KARPAS-422 (ACC 32), and WSU-DLCL2 (ACC 575) were obtained from DSMZ. The cell lines DB (CRL-2289) and SU-DHL2 (CRL-2959) were obtained from ATCC. OCI-LY19, WSU-DLCL2, and DB cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, and KARPAS-422 and SU-DHL2 cell lines were grown in RPMI medium 1640 plus 20% FBS. Cells were grown to a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/mL and 1 × 107 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 264  × g, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed by resuspension in a 10× pellet volume of RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, and 1mM EDTA (Millipore #20-188), plus 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche # 1836153). Lysates were sonicated by two rounds of ten 1-s bursts at setting 3 with a Misonix XL-2000 to ensure efficient histone extraction, and cleared by centrifugation at 4° using a bench top centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Four micrograms of each lysate was fractionated on 4–20% Tris-Glycine gel (Invitrogen), transferred to PVDF, and probed with the following antibodies in Odyssey blocking buffer: mouse anti-EZH2 (CST 3147; 1∶2,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (CST 9733; 1∶10,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me2 (CST 9755; 1∶5,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me1 (Active Motif 39377; 1∶5,000 dilution), and mouse antiTotal H3 (CST 3638; 1∶20,000 dilution). Following primary Ab incubation, membranes were probed with IRDye 800CW donkey-anti-mouse IgG (LiCOR #926-32212) or Alexa Fluor 680 goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen #A-21076) secondary Ab and imaged using the LiCOR Odyssey system.  Next-generation sequencing of follicular lymphoma and diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma has revealed frequent somatic, heterozygous Y641 mutations in the histone methyltransferase EZH2. Heterozygosity and the presence of equal quantities of both mutant and wild-type mRNA and expressed protein suggest a dominant mode of action. Surprisingly, B-cell lymphoma cell lines and lymphoma samples harboring heterozygous EZH2Y641 mutations have increased levels of histone H3 Lys-27–specific trimethylation (H3K27me3). Expression of EZH2Y641F/N mutants in cells with EZH2WT resulted in an increase of H3K27me3 levels in vivo. Structural modeling of EZH2Y641 mutants suggests a “Tyr/Phe switch” model whereby structurally neutral, nontyrosine residues at position 641 would decrease affinity for unmethylated and monomethylated H3K27 substrates and potentially favor trimethylation. We demonstrate, using in vitro enzyme assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, that Y641 mutations result in a decrease in monomethylation and an increase in trimethylation activity of the enzyme relative to the wild-type enzyme. This represents the first example of a disease-associated gain-of-function mutation in a histone methyltransferase, whereby somatic EZH2 Y641 mutations in lymphoma act dominantly to increase, rather than decrease, histone methylation. The dominant mode of action suggests that allele-specific EZH2 inhibitors should be a future therapeutic strategy for this disease.  Go to: Introduction Non-Hodgkin lymphomas represent a diverse spectrum of distinct entities with the 2 most common types represented by follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). There are 2 molecular subtypes of DLBCL based on cell-of-origin distinctions: the activated B-cell type and the germinal center B-cell (GCB) type. Both follicular lymphoma and the GCB subtype of DLBCL derive from germinal center B cells. We have shown that, in 7% of follicular lymphomas and 22% of GCB-type DLBCL, a single point mutation in EZH2, which results in a single amino-acid change at position 641, is selected for; EZH2 (Tyr641 or WT) was mutated to phenylalanine (Y641F), asparagine (Y641N), histidine (Y641H), or serine (Y641S).1 EZH2 has been implicated as an oncoprotein often overexpressed in many solid tumors.2–4 Initial analysis of the activity of Y641 variants in cell-free reconstituted Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) complexes using unmethylated peptides suggested that the mutations behaved as a loss of function.1  EZH2 is the catalytic member of the PRC2; however, EZH2 alone has very weak histone-methylating activity. Other members of the PRC2 complex include EED, SUZ12, AEBP2, and RbAp48 and are required for full activity. The PRC2 complex has been shown to exhibit in vitro enzyme activity on histone peptide substrates and nucleosomes. EZH2 is a member of the Su(var)3,9, enhancer of zest, Trithorax (SET) domain containing family of histone methyltransferases (HMTases); all contain a conserved SET domain. Genetic and biochemical analysis of EZH2 SET domain has revealed their histone methyltransferase function associated with histone H3 Lys-27–specific trimethylation (H3K27me3) in vivo. Recently, a structural basis for the allosteric modulation of EZH2 activity by EED has been elucidated.5  Structural and biochemical data from other SET domain HMTases have shed light not only on the molecular mechanism of histone methylation but also the specific residues of the conserved SET domain responsible for these reactions. For example, all active HMTases contain a catalytic triad—the asparagine-histidine-serine (NHS) motif,6 and mutation of any one of these residues in the active site abolishes the activity of the enzyme. Studies have also implicated residues important for the binding of the S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)7 and for recognition of the amino-acid sequence of the histone peptide tail.8 However, these studies have not shed light on the role of the highly evolutionarily conserved Tyr 641 of EZH2.  Through the use of molecular modeling and recently published molecular and biochemical data from an allelic series of G9a9 and by analogy to the “Tyr/Phe” switch alleles in other methyltransferases,10,11 we show that Tyr 641 of EZH2 is implicated in substrate and product specificity. Taken together with the finding that DLBCL cell lines heterozygous for EZH2 mutants exhibit higher steady-state levels of H3K27me3 and in vitro enzyme studies, a possible mechanism may be proposed. This report provides evidence that EZH2 Y641 mutant protein-containing PRC2 complexes exhibit increased activity on dimethylated peptides compared with wild-type containing PRC2 complexes, thereby shifting the steady state of H3K27 to favor trimethylation in vivo. As previously described, the EZH2 mutant-containing PRC2 complexes are inactive on unmethylated histone peptides,1 implying that the Y641F/N mutations can only act in the presence of a wild-type EZH2.

EZH2 complexes were immunoprecipitated with 30 μg of anti-EZH2 antibody (#612667, BD Biosciences) by rotating overnight at 4°C. Antibody-bound protein complexes were then incubated with 120 μL of Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 4°C. Bound EZH2 complexes were washed 5 times with 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 30 μL of sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading dye. Samples were resolved using a 4% to 12% gradient gel (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and stained with colloidal Coomassie stain. After destaining, the gel was cut into 16 slices per lane corresponding to a specific molecular weight range. In-gel trypsin digestion was performed, and peptides were extracted from the gel using standard protocols.16  High-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry (MS) was performed on a 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/Sciex) coupled to an Agilent 1100 Nano-HPLC (Agilent Technologies) using a nano-electrospray interface, as described in supplemental data.  Histone methyltransferase assay  Similar batches of recombinant reconstituted active PRC2 complexes as used previously1 containing EZH2WT(51 004), EZH2Y641N, or EZH2Y641F were purchased from BPS Biosciences. Methyltransferase assays were performed using a kit (#17-330, Millipore) as per the manufacturer's instructions, except that biotinylated peptides were used as substrates; 250 ng of active PRC2 complex was incubated with 0.67μM 3H-SAM (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences), 1μM biotinylated peptide in 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 0.5mM dithiothreitol for 30 minutes at 30°C in a 10-μL volume. A total of 5 μL was spotted on a P81 square paper (Millipore), washed (twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid and once with 100% ethanol) to remove unincorporated SAM, air-dried, and placed in a glass scintillation vial with 5 mL of scintillation fluid (ScintiSafe Econo1, Fisher Chemical) and counted on a 1900TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).  Modeling  A model of the EZH2 core catalytic domain lining the substrate lysine binding channel was built by homology to the G9a/EHMT2 structure (PDB code 2o8j), based on the alignment shown in supplemental Figure 6 and supplemental Figure 8. The EZH2 sequence was threaded onto the G9a backbone, and when homologous, G9a side chains were used as a template to position EZH2 residues, according to the “minimize tethers” command using ICM, Version 3.6-1g (Molsoft LLC17).  Retroviral infection and B-cell in vitro differentiation assay  Parental strain mice were bred and maintained as approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. Primary mouse bone marrow cells were transduced as previously described with minor modifications.18 Details are in the supplemental data.  Go to: Results EZH2Y641F/N proteins are expressed approximately 1:1 with wild-type EZH2 in DLBCL cell lines  Conspicuously, the EZH2 mutations identified in GCB lymphomas are all located in exon 15 of EZH2, and all are missense mutations that change a single highly evolutionarily conserved tyrosine residue in the catalytic SET domain (Tyr641 or WT) to phenylalanine (Y641F), asparagine (Y641N), histidine (Y641H), or serine (Y641S).1 This recurrent pattern of a heterozygous somatic mutation in a functionally conserved region, affecting a single residue, is highly suggestive of a gain of dominant mode of action, either dominant negative or a gain-of-function/neomorph. Both wild-type (EZH2WT) and EZH2Y641 variant transcripts could be observed in lymphoma-derived cell lines (Y641N: DB, Karpas 422, SU-DHL-6, and Y641F: WSU-DLCL-2) bearing the mutations (supplemental Figure 1). Potentially, the mutations at EZH2Y641 could alter the stability of the protein. To investigate this possibility, we developed a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode MS signature for tryptic peptides covering the mutated region of EZH2 (wild-type, MutF) and a common region from tandem MS spectra of recombinant EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F (Figure 1A; supplemental Figure 2A-B) and used this to estimate the abundance of mutant EZH2 in malignant cells. To determine the amount of mutant EZH2 in a DLCBL cell line, we immunoprecipitated total endogenous EZH2 from nuclear lysates of the WSU-DLCL2 cell line (EZH2Y641F) and the DOHH2 cell line (EZH2WT) from 2 independent experiments. Gel electrophoresis fractions of the immunoprecipitates encompassing the size of EZH2 were analyzed for the peptides by MRM-MS. Signals for the wild-type, MutF, and common peptides were observed in the WSU-DLCL2 cell line, whereas only wild-type and common signals were observed in the DOHH2 cell line (Figure 1B; supplemental Figure 2C; and data not shown), demonstrating that both EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F proteins were present in the WSU-DLCL2 cell line. The wild-type/MutF peak area ratios were compared with the wild-type/MutF peak area ratios of an external standard curve of mixtures of recombinant EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F (Figure 1C). The percentage EZH2WT was calculated from an equation fit to the standard curve. The comparison indicated that there was a 40:60 EZH2WT/EZH2Y641F protein ratio in the WSU-DLCL2 sample (Figure 1C; supplemental Figure 2C); thus, approximately equal quantities of mutant EZH2 protein are present, showing that the mutations do not adversely affect the stability of the protein in vivo and therefore that any differences in activity should not be explained by a highly skewed ratio of wild-type and mutant proteins alone.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Quantitation of EZH2 wild-type and EZH2 Y641F (MutF) protein expression by mass spectrometry. (A) Tandem MS spectra of recombinant EZH2 wild-type and MutF peptides (residues 635-654) used in the MRM assay. Peptide fragments (y and b ions) identified are ... EZH2Y641 mutation bearing B-cell lymphoma cell lines and GCB lymphoma containing tissues exhibit higher levels of H3K27me3 than wild-type  Initial studies1 of EZH2Y641F/N cell-free, reconstituted PRC2 complexes showed that the mutant EZH2-containing PRC2 complexes had 7-fold less activity in converting unmethylated H3K27 target peptides, compared with wild-type. This would suggest that mutation-bearing cell lines and tumors should have globally reduced H3K27me3 levels. A direct comparison is complicated by the nonisogenic status of the cell lines and, in the case of primary tumor material, by variable tumor cellularity. Nevertheless, we measured H3K27me3 (with 2 different H3K27me3 antibodies, verified for monospecificity; see “Western blotting and immunoprecipitation”; supplemental Figure 3) with respect to total H3, in a series of GCB-derived lymphoma cell lines, sequenced to determine the presence or absence of Y641 mutations. Unexpectedly, we found that EZH2Y641F/N bearing cell lines (Figure 2A,G) and tumors (Figure 2B,H) generally exhibited greater levels of H3K27me3 than wild-type cases, suggesting hyperactivity of the PRC2 complexes.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Y641 mutations in B-cell lines and tumors increase steady state of H3K27me3. (A) Steady-state H3K27me3 levels in DLBCL. Nuclear lysates from DLCBCLs with either wild-type EZH2 (Pfeiffer, MD903, NU-DHL-1, NU-DUL-1, DOHH2, and Toledo) or heterozygous for ... EZH2Y641F/N mutants act dominantly in HEK293T and in vitro differentiated B cells to increase H3K27me3 levels  The first 2 sets of observations strongly suggested that EZH2Y641F/N mutants could act dominantly in cells to increase H3K27me3. To test this idea, we expressed wild-type and EZH2Y641F/N proteins in HEK293T cells (wild-type for EZH2) and measured the effect on total H3K27me3 levels. Both stable and transient expression of EZH2Y641F/N mutant proteins in a wild-type context (HEK293T cells) results in a significant increase in H3K27me3 (Figure 2C; supplemental Figure 4), whereas wild-type EZH2 or the methyltransferase dead EZH2H689A,19 expressed in the same cell types results in a barely detectable increase in H3K27me3 (Figure 2D). Notably, the increase in the steady-state levels of H3K27me3 occurred, even though stable expression of GFP-EZH2Y641 protein was lower compared with endogenous EZH2 (Figure 2C upper band). To show that GFP-EZH2 was expressed as part of the PRC2,13 we immunoprecipitated GFP-tagged EZH2 and probed with EZH2, EED, or SUZ12. As shown in Figure 2E, mutant EZH2 was able to coprecipitate with other members of the PRC2 complex. EZH2Y641 mutants thus shifted the in vivo equilibrium levels of H3K27 methylation from monomethylation and dimethylation to predominantly trimethylation (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the cell lines bearing EZH2Y641F/N mutations are also uniformly and markedly more resistant (supplemental Figure 5) to 3-deazaneplanocin A, a global small-molecule inhibitor of single-carbon transfer methyltransferases, which has been reported as a nonspecific inhibitor of EZH2 activity20,21 (specific inhibitors have yet to be described). Finally, we asked whether Y641 variants were capable of conferring a gain of H3K27me3 on B-cell lineages in the mouse. Primary murine primary bone marrow cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing GFP and either wild-type EZH2 or EZH2Y641F and differentiated into the B-cell lineage in the presence of IL7 and FLT3-L. Measurement of total H3K27me3 again showed increased H3K27me3 (Figure 2F) in cells bearing EZH2Y641F, whereas EZH2WT constructs did not confer this phenotype (Figure 2F).  Structural modeling suggests that Tyr 641 residue may be involved in product equilibrium  We sought to understand why EZH2Y641F/N variants act dominantly through a structural analysis of this region in EZH2. Scanning mutagenesis and solved structures have provided insights into regions governing substrate preferences and specificity of several methytransferases; however, a fully solved structure of the EZH2 protein is not currently available. We therefore undertook structural homology modeling of the catalytic core region of EZH2 on the high resolution crystal structures of the lysine dimethyltransferase, G9a, and the lysine monomethyltransferase, SETD7 for which there are also detailed enzymatic data9,10 (Figure 3; supplemental Figures 6-8). Y641 of EZH2 aligns with Y1067 in G9a, which when mutated to Phe was recently shown to convert G9a into a trimethyltransferase with a concomitant decrease in monomethylation and dimethylation activity.9 Similarly, the analogous residue in SETD7 (Y245) can also confer trimethyltransferase activity on SETD7 when mutated to Ala.10 The structures reveal that Tyr in this position forms a hydrogen bond with the substrate lysine amino nitrogen moiety and keeps one of its lone pair electrons oriented away from the SAM methyl donor (Figure 3 black arrow). Thus, this Tyr residue “ties up” the face of the recipient lysyl nitrogen to which the third methyl would otherwise be transferred. This Tyr-substrate hydrogen bond also contributes to the preferred binding affinity of the enzyme for monomethylated and unmethylated substrates as evidenced by the weaker Km values of the Y1067F G9a mutants for unmethylated and monomethylated substrates.9 Furthermore, the Km of G9a Y1067F for dimethylated substrate reflects a stronger affinity for H3K27me2 than for monomethylated or unmethylated substrates.9 In the trimethyltransferases, such as EZH2, this tyrosine residue is also conserved, probably facilitating the first 2 methyl transfer reactions. Because the active sites of EZH2WT can also accommodate a third methyl group, it has probably evolved a compromise between monomethylation, dimethylation, and trimethylation (relative to G9a, for example), perhaps via small structural adjustments that allow it to carry out trimethylation, even in the presence of the Y641 residue. Thus, mutation of Y641 in EZH2 to residues, such as Phe (F) or Asn (N), which do not disturb the structure, can be predicted to abrogate the affinity for unmethylated or monomethylated lysine substrates while at the same time reducing steric crowding in the active site, thereby potentially facilitating the catalytic efficiency for trimethylation.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Homology model of the active site of EZH2. The model is based on sequence and structure alignment with histone dimethyltransferase G9a/EHMT2 (PDBID 2O8J).9 This was also structurally aligned with GLP/EHMT1 bound to an H3K9me2 peptide substrate (PDBID ... Mutations of these tyrosine residues (analogous to Y641 in EZH2) result in a shift of product equilibrium to favor the trimethylated state. The structural and functional basis of the substitution of Tyr to smaller residues, particularly Phe, is known as the Tyr/Phe switch.11,22 Although the Tyr/Phe switch has been described at other residues from scanning mutagenesis in vitro, this is the first example of a disease-associated Tyr/Phe switch.  EZH2Y641-containing PRC2 complexes show increased substrate preference for dimethylated peptide in vitro  To test the structural hypothesis that EZH2Y641 mutations have a reduced ability to methylate H3K27me0/1 substrates but increased ability to methylate H3K27me2 substrates, we next studied the function of the enzyme in vitro. Because the relative catalytic efficiency of the EZH2/PRC2 complex for each methyl addition step is poorly understood, we carried out a 3H methyl incorporation assay using recombinant PRC2 complexes,23 containing EED, SUZ12, AEBP2, RbAp48, and wild-type or EZH2Y641 mutants, as previously described.1 We assayed the activity of the variant proteins by measuring 3H-methyl incorporation, using unmodified, chemically synthesized monomethylated and dimethylated K27 substrate peptides, in preference to nucleosomes because the latter contain endogenous histone modifications (supplemental Figure 3) that make nucleosome assays difficult to interpret (supplemental Figure 9). Strikingly, EZH2Y641 mutants showed (Figure 4) strongly reduced activity on unmethylated or monomethylated peptides but markedly enhanced activity on dimethylated peptides compared with EZH2 wild-type containing PRC2 complexes. We estimated the specific activity of the protein complexes (Table 1) and observed that the EZH2Y641F/N containing PRC2 complexes are approximately twice as active on dimethylated peptides compared with wild-type. These data indicate that EZH2Y641F/N mutations alter the substrate specificity, as suggested by the structural model, in favor of dimethylated peptides compared with PRC2 containing complexes with only wild-type EZH2.  Figure 4 Figure 4 In vitro PRC2 activity of EZH2. Histone methyltransferase reaction was performed using 1.2μM biotinylated peptide substrate (ie, peptide mimicking the H3 tail, H3(21-44)), which has been unmethylated (H3K27me0, open bar or me0), monomethylated ... Table 1 Table 1 Specific activity of PRC2 complexes Go to: Discussion The relevance of somatic mutations in chromatin-modifying enzymes in cancer has recently been emphasized by discoveries of high-frequency somatic mutations in UTX, JMJD demethylases, ARID1A, and in EZH2.1,24–27 However, the mechanisms by which these mutations promote or enable carcinogenesis are largely unknown, as are the relevant modes of allelism (dominance, recessive). We show here, for the first time, a dominant (neomorphic) allele of a histone methyltransferase associated with a specific cancer.  Taken together, our data strongly suggest that EZH2Y641F/N variants in lymphoma act dominantly, through a mechanism that involves altered substrate catalytic specificity of the mutant EZH2 enzyme for its substrates. Our data show that, despite equimolar quantities of mutant and wild-type proteins in malignant cells, there is greater total H3K27me3 in mutant-bearing cell lines and primary tumors. Moreover, the EZH2Y641F/N variants have a strong dominant effect on H3K27me3 levels in cell lines that are wild-type for EZH2. They act in trans to provide a strong gain of function.  The probable mechanism is suggested by structural and enzymatic analysis of the EZH2Y641F/N variants. As shown in the cell-free assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, EZH2Y641F/N cannot carry out trimethylation of unmodified or monomethylated substrates (Figure 4)1 but still are able to form PRC2 complexes (Figure 2E) and increase the steady state of H3K27 trimethylation in vivo (Figure 2C-D). This means that it is probable that the gain of function of EZH2Y641 mutants would be to shift the monomethylated and/or dimethylated state of H3K27 to that of trimethylation (Figure 2D) on some bona fide EZH2 targets. It is clear that in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-histone H3K27me1 and anti-histone H3K27me3,28 that expression of EZH2Y641 mutants could shift the steady-state levels from H3K27me1 (which is correlated with gene activation) and H3K27me2 to H3K27me3, which is correlated with gene repression.29 Whether or not these EZH2Y641 mutants are able to catalyze higher order methylation on non-EZH2 (such as EZH130) targets remains an area of active investigation. The mechanism and the in vitro assays show that EZH2Y641F/N cannot catalyze monomethylation and dimethylation efficiently; therefore, the mutant protein is completely dependent on the presence of wild-type proteins for the gain-of-function effect. This requirement for a wild-type copy of EZH2 is highly analogous to the behavior of the Drosophila E(z)1 allele31,32; E(z)1 (homologous to EZH2Y641N) leads to a phenotypic gain of function and has been shown to act as a dominant repressor of E(z) target genes. However, the unique phenotype of the E(z)1 allele depends on the presence of the wild-type allele, and the E(z)1 enzyme appears to be inactive when assayed in vitro.32  It has been shown that overexpression of EZH2 is a feature of some cancers,2–4 whereas histone H3K27 demethylase UTX was found to be inactivated in other tumors.24,25 This would suggest that the increase in H3K27me3 levels may be achieved in cancer cells by redundant pathways induced by overexpression of EZH2 or inactivation of UTX. Our findings are consistent with this idea, as dominant EZH2Y641 mutations also increase the levels of H3K27me3 (Figure 5). It is currently unknown whether the gain of H3K27me3 in germinal center-derived B-cell lymphomas reflects an increase of methylation at normal PRC2 targets, or possibly a gain of methylation at noncanonical PRC2 targets. The significance of H3K27me3 may well be lineage/cell type dependent, and this will require future conditional alleles and lineage studies to dissect as well as improved efficiency of ChIP-seq methods in small cell populations. However, recent studies have emphasized that GCB lymphomas are dependent on EZH2 and that knockdown of EZH2 in GCB cell lines bearing Y641 mutations results in cell cycle arrest in germinal center B cells.33 Knockdown of EZH2 in this context results in increased expression of PRC2-regulated tumor suppressors. This is consistent with the physiologic roles of EZH2 in B-cell development and differentiation,34–36 although it should be noted that a full understanding of the PRC2 targets in B cells remains to be elucidated. Taken together with the present study, these support the notion that EZH2 is causally implicated.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Model depicting pathways to increase H3K27me3 levels that result in cancer. In this schematic diagram: solid arrow represents a direct effect; dotted arrow, multiple steps that lead to an effect. The observation of a dominant, gain-of-function mutation through altered catalytic preference in histone methyltransferases is unprecedented in cancer and carries important implications for drug development against EZH2. It is interesting to note that the substrate pockets of the mutant enzymes probably have a new, larger shape (smaller side chains of His, Asn, or Phe relative to wild-type Tyr), which potentially could be selectively targeted therapeutically in a strategy similar to that used to develop selective inhibitors of glycine gatekeeper mutants of protein kinases.37  Data from several cancer types suggest that dysregulation of polycomb group complexes (PcGs) can contribute to malignant transformation, consistent with the fact that PcGs regulate thousands of transcripts responsible for cell fate1, 2, 3. The role of PcG-mediated gene silencing in cancer is supported by the observation that many cancers harbor higher levels of or activating mutations in genes encoding PcG subunits. Moreover, PcG-repressed genes include tumor suppressors such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2a; also known as INK4a/ARF) locus4, 5, 6.  EZH2 is the catalytic component of polycomb repressive complex group 2 (PRC2) and was first identified in Drosophila for its role in development and differentiation. EZH2 is highly expressed in different types of B cell tumors7, 8 and, along with the PcG proteins embryonic ectoderm development (EED) and BMI1 polycomb ring finger oncogene (BMI1), it is critical for B cell development9, 10, 11. Sequencing studies identified frequent mutations in the region encoding the catalytic EZH2 SET domain (for example, mutations altering Tyr646 in humans (Tyr641 in mice)) in germinal center (GC) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma12, 13, 14. Somatic EZH2 mutations or amplifications also occur in other tumor types, including non-small-cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, colon carcinoma and melanoma15, 16, 17, whereas loss-of-function events appear in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML)18 and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)19. These findings suggest that EZH2 may be a potential therapeutic target for cancers other than lymphoma, and there are currently five open clinical trials testing three different EZH2 inhibitors (produced by GlaxoSmithKline, Epizyme and Constellation Pharmaceuticals).  No mouse model of the most common EZH2 SET-domain-encoding mutation is currently available to investigate its cell-dependent in vivo effect or to test the efficacy of EZH2-targeted therapeutics. To understand the role and function of this mutation in malignant progression, we generated a mouse model in which the mutated Ezh2 allele is 'knocked-in' to the native locus with intact cis-regulatory elements, permitting conditional expression of the mutant protein. We examined the ability of this allele to promote lymphoid and solid (such as melanoma) malignancies by itself and in cooperation with other oncogenic events by crossing mice with the knocked-in Ezh2 allele to mouse strains expressing tissue-specific Cre recombinase.  Results Abstract• Introduction• Results• Discussion• Methods• Accession codes• References• Acknowledgments• Author information• Supplementary information Expression of Ezh2Y641F promotes lymphoma We validated expression of the Ezh2Y641F allele by Southern blot, PCR and qRT–PCR (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a–d). In the absence of Cre-mediated recombination, the allele produced a wild-type (WT) transcript (Fig. 1a), and after Cre-mediated deletion of a loxP-flanked ('floxed') 'mini-gene', it expressed the Ezh2Y641F allele, which is equivalent to the most common EZH2 missense allele (EZH2Y646F) in human cancers15, 17. To assess functionality in vivo, we crossed mice with the Ezh2Y641F allele to CD19Cre/+ mice which constitutively express Cre recombinase in B lymphocytes20. CD19+ B cells from 8-week-old CD19Cre/+ and CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/+ mice expressed Ezh2 transcripts at equal levels (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Consistent with a reported gain of function of the protein encoded by the EZH2Y641F allele in humans21, B cells from 8-week-old CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/+ mice had an approximately threefold increase in H3K27me3 amounts, as compared to those in B cells from CD19Cre/+Ezh2+/+ mice and CD19− cells (Fig. 1b). Expression of Ezh2Y641F had minimal effect on B cell development in 8-week-old mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a–h).

In contrast to results from mice expressing Ezh2Y641F under the control of a collagen promoter22, expression of Ezh2Y641F from the endogenous locus induced highly penetrant B cell lymphoma with a median survival of 1 year (Fig. 1c). All of the tumors from CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/+ mice that were analyzed (n = 15) showed recombination of the Ezh2 allele (data not shown) and a CD45+B220+CD19+IgM+CD43+CD5+ immunophenotype; they also expressed the myeloid marker Mac1 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Tumor-bearing mice also showed disruption of the splenic architecture and expansion of abnormal, large lymphoid cells in the white pulp, and ~50% of the animals had frank leukemia and/or hepatic involvement (Supplementary Fig. 3b). The tumors showed increased expression of H3K27me3 and were readily transplantable into syngeneic recipients (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3c–e). Therefore, physiological expression of Ezh2Y641F in young mice does not markedly perturb the development of B lymphocytes, but it does seem to facilitate malignant transformation.  To determine whether genetic alterations detected in human B cell lymphomas cooperate with Ezh2Y641F in tumor formation, we transduced hematopoietic progenitors from CD19Cre/+Ezh2+/+ or CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/+ mice with retroviruses expressing Bcl2 or Myc. Expression of Myc subtly increased B cell lymphocytosis in CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/+ mice (Supplementary Fig. 4a), but it did not accelerate tumor formation (Fig. 1e). Consistent with a previous report22, recipients of Bcl2-transduced CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/+ hematopoietic progenitors developed advanced B cell lymphoma much faster than recipients of Bcl2-transduced CD19Cre/+Ezh2+/+ cells (P < 0.001; Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 4b,c). Moreover, the combination of somatic Trp53 inactivation with Ezh2Y641F expression accelerated lymphoma formation (P < 0.001; Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 4d,e). These results suggest that globally increased H3K27me3 levels cooperate with apoptotic resistance mediated by Bcl2 overexpression or Trp53 loss to accelerate B cell transformation, consistent with the co-occurrence of these genetic alterations in human B cell lymphoma23.  In vitro, EZH2Y641F-expressing cells exhibit decreased H3K27 mono-methylase activity but increased di- and trimethylase activity, as compared to those in EZH2+/+ cells21, 24, suggesting that transformation may require expression of both WT and mutant proteins. Consistent with this model, to our knowledge, all human cancers observed to date that harbor EZH2Y641F mutations also retain a WT copy of EZH2 (refs. 13, 15, 17, 23). To test the requirement of WT Ezh2 for tumorigenesis, we determined the tumor latency of CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/Y641F mice. CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/Y641F mice developed splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy with an infiltration of abnormal B220lowMac1low B cells (Fig. 1g,h) with kinetics and a tumor immunophenotype nearly identical to those of CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/+ mice. Mice heterozygous or homozygous for the Ezh2Y641F mutation had elevated levels of H3K27me3, as compared to those in controls (Fig. 1i). Because both alleles from tumors of Ezh2Y641F/Y641F underwent recombination (Supplementary Fig. 4f), and therefore express only mutant Ezh2, these data demonstrate that WT Ezh2 function is dispensable for tumorigenesis in cells harboring Ezh2Y641F mutations. This observation could reflect residual monomethylase activity by the Ezh2Y641F variant, which may not be a feature of other Tyr646 mutants of EZH2 (ref. 21); it is also possible that another H3K27 monomethylase (such as EZH1) compensates for loss of EZH2 activity in these tumors.  Ezh2Y641F cooperates with Braf but not Nras to induce melanoma In addition to lymphoma, EZH2Y646 mutations are observed in 3% of human melanoma25, 26, 27, with focal amplifications of EZH2 being noted in 15 of 262 (5.7%) cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Because BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R mutations occur in the majority of human melanomas, we tested the ability of the Ezh2Y641F allele to cooperate with the conditionally activatable mouse alleles of BrafV600E (ref. 28) or NrasQ61R (ref. 29) in the presence of the tamoxifen-inducible tyrosinase–Cre allele (Tyr-CreERT2)30, 31. Melanoma was not observed in Tyr-CreERT2BrafV600 mice, as previously described29, 32. The inclusion, however, of a heterozygous Ezh2Y641F mutation rapidly accelerated tumorigenesis of unpigmented, nonmetastatic melanoma in the context of BrafV600E activation alone or BrafV600E in combination with a heterozygous conditional allele of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PtenL/+) (Fig. 2a–c). Ezh2Y641F, therefore, cooperates with mutant Braf (±haploinsufficiency of Pten) in melanoma formation and maintenance.

Because Braf is considered to be a downstream effector of Nras signaling and an upstream effector of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (involving the MEK and ERK kinases), the differing abilities of NrasQ61R and BrafV600E to promote melanoma in the context of Ezh2Y641F were unexpected. We carefully examined data from prior melanoma sequencing studies25, 26, 27 using cBIOPORTAL15, 17. In accordance with our mouse genetic results, EZH2 mutations in human melanoma co-occur with activating mutations in BRAF at a significant frequency (P = 0.006) and are mutually exclusive with NRAS mutations (P = 0.004) (Supplementary Fig. 5). These results suggest that although RAF–MEK–ERK activation synergizes with EZH2Y646F mutations in melanoma formation, a RAF-independent aspect of mutant RAS signaling renders the oncogenic effects of mutant EZH2 irrelevant to transformation.  We performed experiments to address the cooperation of the EZH2 mutation with BRAF but not NRAS. In the mouse, we observed that expression of Nras and Braf was not altered in the presence of the Ezh2Y641F mutation (data not shown). A major pathway activated by NRAS but not BRAF is the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. To determine whether mutant NRAS but not BRAF inhibits the expression or enzymatic activity of EZH2, we transduced primary human melanocytes with constructs expressing BRAFV600E, NRASQ61K or PIK3CACAAX, which encodes a membrane-bound and constitutively active catalytic subunit of PI3K. As previously reported33, expression of each resulted in oncogene-induced cellular senescence, as characterized by increased expression of p16INK4a (Fig. 2e), ceased cellular proliferation and flat, enlarged cellular morphology (data not shown). Expression of BRAFV600E, NRASQ61K or PIK3CACAAX did not significantly alter EZH2 mRNA levels (Fig. 2f); however, NRASQ61K and PIK3CACAAX, but not BRAFV600E, expression resulted in a global decrease in H3K27me3 levels (Fig. 2g). This result is consistent with prior reports suggesting that activated AKT induces genome-wide changes in H3K27me3 (ref. 34) via phosphorylation and suppression of EZH2 activity35. These experiments suggest that Ras–PI3K activation attenuates the oncogenic effects of Ezh2Y641F, explaining the inability of NrasQ61K to accelerate melanoma formation.  Ezh2 activity is required for tumor maintenance Next we investigated whether Ezh2 inhibition could suppress tumor growth in these mice. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of Ezh2 in cell lines derived from the mouse melanomas described above resulted in significant growth inhibition (P < 0.01; Fig. 3a,b), suggesting that Ezh2 is required not only for tumor initiation but also maintenance. To determine the importance of Ezh2 enzymatic activity, we supplemented these genetic results with a pharmacological approach. We treated cell lines derived from Tyr-CreERT2BrafV600Ezh2Y641F/+ melanoma with three EZH2 inhibitors: UNC1999 (ref. 36), GSK126 (ref. 37) and a previously unpublished S-5′adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-competitive pyridinone inhibitor, JQEZ5. The inhibitors from Constellation Pharmaceuticals and Epizyme were not available to us for comparative analysis at the times of these studies. JQEZ5 was designed as an open-source compound with high potency and bioavailability, is ~10-fold selective for EZH2 over EZH1 and shows in vitro activity for the EZH2Y646F mutant in a homogenous assay (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). In a panel of Ezh2+/+ or Ezh2Y641F melanoma cell lines, treatment with UNC1999 or GSK126 showed half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) of >3.5 μM, regardless of Ezh2 genotype (ratio of average EC50(Ezh2WT)/EC50(Ezh2Y641F) = 1.4 for both agents; Supplementary Fig. 6c). In contrast, JQEZ5 was nearly fivefold more potent in Ezh2Y641F-expressing melanoma cell lines than in Ezh2WT-expressing cell lines (EC50(Ezh2Y641F) = 860 nM versus EC50(Ezh2WT) = 4.0 μM; Supplementary Fig. 6c,d). Treatment with all three compounds resulted in decreased H3K27me3 levels, with JQEZ5 being effective at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). All three compounds induced cell cycle arrest within 3–5 d of treatment at their respective EC50 values (Fig. 3e). Submicromolar exposures of JQEZ5 for >1 week also induced cell death in the Ezh2Y641F lines (Supplementary Fig. 7c,d). To determine whether Ezh1, an Ezh2 homolog, was responsible for the residual H3K27me3 signal observed after Ezh2 inhibition (Fig. 3c,d), we knocked down Ezh1 in mutant melanoma cell lines treated with JQEZ5. Ezh1 knockdown did not affect cell growth or global H3K27me3 levels in inhibitor-treated Ezh2+/+ or Ezh2Y641F cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 8), suggesting that Ezh1 does not compensate for Ezh2 inhibition in these melanomas.

Full size image (153 KB) Download Excel source data (46 KB) Previous Figures index Next We next assessed the antitumor efficacy of EZH2 inhibitors in vivo. We studied lymphoma in CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/+ mice with autochthonous tumors and melanoma in immunodeficient mice transplanted with cell lines derived from the tumors of Tyr-CreERT2BrafV600EPtenL/+Ezh2Y641F/+ or Tyr-CreERT2BrafV600EPtenL/L mice. After the tumors reached 10 mm3 in size, the mice were treated with vehicle, the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (25 mg per kg body weight (mg/kg) daily), JQEZ5 (50 mg/kg, daily) or a combination of both. JQEZ5 was selected for these studies because it was the most efficacious compound in vitro, exhibited low toxicity and had favorable pharmacokinetic properties in vivo, comparable to those of Ezh2 inhibitors currently in clinical trials (Supplementary Fig. 6c–e). As single agents, dabrafenib and JQEZ5 treatment resulted in tumor growth inhibition in both Ezh2+/+ and Ezh2Y641F/+ tumors, with dabrafenib being the more potent agent. Combinatorial treatment with dabrafenib and JQEZ5 resulted in additive activity in Ezh2Y641F/+ but not Ezh2+/+ tumors (Fig. 3f). After developing lymphoma, as assessed by the appearance of pathological symptoms, CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/+ mice were treated with vehicle or 50 mg/kg JQEZ5 by daily intraperitoneal injection. Six days of treatment with JQEZ5 completely cleared the malignant population (B220lowMac1low) from the spleen, without depleting normal B cells (Fig. 3g,h and Supplementary Fig. 6f). These data show that a selective inhibitor of EZH2 has potent single-agent activity in vivo in an autochthonous model of Ezh2Y641F-mutated B cell lymphoma and is effective in combination with a BRAF inhibitor in RAF-mutant melanoma.  Effects of Ezh2Y641F on RNA expression To understand the molecular effects of Ezh2 activation in B cells and melanoma, we performed RNA-seq and H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq). Because the expression of Ezh2Y641F in young adult mice did not alter B cell development (Supplementary Fig. 2), for B cell analysis, we examined CD19+ cells isolated from the spleens of 8-week-old CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/+ and CD19Cre/+Ezh2+/+ littermates. For melanoma experiments, we screened >20 cell lines derived from tumors of Tyr-CreERT2BrafV600PtenL/+Ezh2Y641F/+ mice and subcloned two lines that had not recombined the Ezh2 allele. After in vitro 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen treatment, these lines yielded isogenic lines that differed in only expression of the Ezh2 mutation. In B cells, 213 transcripts were upregulated and 346 were repressed by expression of Ezh2Y641F (P < 0.01, Supplementary Table 1), whereas 563 genes were upregulated and 746 were downregulated after expression of Ezh2Y641F in melanoma cells (P < 0.01; Supplementary Table 2). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in both B cells and melanoma cell lines expressing Ezh2Y641F revealed a significant concordance between genes downregulated in cells expressing Ezh2Y641F and genes silenced by the PRC2 complex38, 39 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 3). In separate biological replicates, we confirmed by qRT–PCR the altered expression of eight transcripts identified by RNA-seq (Supplementary Fig. 9).  Figure 4: Gene expression in Ezh2Y641F reflects enrichment for PRC2 targets, H3K27me3-suppressed genes and a Myc signature.

Full size image (251 KB) Download Excel source data (36 KB) Previous Figures index Next The RNA-seq analysis yielded two unexpected results. In B cells, GSEA indicated that transcripts repressed by expression of Ezh2Y641F were enriched for genes known to be repressed by Myc activation in other B lineage cells40, 41, 42 (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 10a,b and Supplementary Table 3). Additionally, enrichment for Myc targets was also observed in Ezh2Y641F-expressing melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Table 3). To directly assess the relationship between MYC and EZH2 in B cells, we first used a B cell lymphoma line (P493-6) (ref. 43) with tetracycline (tet)-inducible MYC expression. After activation of MYC expression, EZH2 expression increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4c), resulting in increased global H3K27me3 levels (Fig. 4d). We next analyzed MYC ChIP data sets that were available through the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium and looked for enrichment of MYC and MYC-associated factor X (MAX; a dimerization partner of MYC) at the EZH2 locus. Our analysis showed multiple MYC–MAX binding sites at the EZH2 transcription start site (TSS), in the EZH2 promoter and at an enhancer ~50 kb 5′ to the TSS in multiple cell types, including lymphoma (Supplementary Fig. 10c). The MYC–MAX binding peaks were associated with strong peaks of H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac, Supplementary Fig. 10c), suggesting transcriptional activation. These findings agree with prior studies of MYC and EZH2 expression44, 45 and suggest that some of the oncogenic effects of MYC amplification in B cell lymphoma may be mediated by EZH2 activation.  A second unexpected finding from the RNA-seq analysis of Ezh2Y641F cells was an increase in the expression of many genes known to be directly repressed by the PRC2 complex and EZH2—such as Hoxc4, Hoxc9 and Meis1 in B cells (Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 1) and the Hoxd gene cluster in melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Table 2). By mining Epigenomics Roadmap46 data, we noted that many of the PRC2-regulated genes that were activated by Ezh2Y641F were densely covered with repressive H3K27me3 marks in normal B cells, suggesting that these genes are silenced in healthy cells (Supplementary Fig. 11a). In contrast, many of the genes most strongly repressed by Ezh2Y641F lacked H3K27me3 in normal B cells and, instead, were located near enhancer elements marked with H3K27ac (Supplementary Fig. 11b). This suggests that Ezh2Y641F activates certain silenced genes and silences certain activated genes.  Ezh2Y641F expression causes global re-distribution of H3K27me3 To determine whether this apparent pattern was a direct effect of altered H3K27me3 abundance, we performed H3K27me3 ChIP-seq. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the differentially expressed ChIP-seq peaks showed that the first PC of the data set reflected the Ezh2 genotype, whereas a second, weaker PC reflected the tissue of origin (B cells versus melanoma) (Fig. 5a). Treatment with JQEZ5 altered the peak pattern in Ezh2-mutant melanoma cell lines along the first PC toward untreated isogenic WT cells (Fig. 5a), suggesting that EZH2 inhibition significantly 'normalized' the peak pattern in Ezh2Y641F-expressing cells. This hypothesis was confirmed when H3K27me3 was visualized across the entire genome (Supplementary Fig. 12a).  Figure 5: Ezh2Y641F changes the genomic distribution and dynamics of H3K27me3.

(g) Meta-analysis of the amplitude and distribution of H3K27me3 signals relative to the broad H3K27me3 domains identified in Ezh2+/+ melanoma cells. 100 variable-width windows cover the peak regions, and 100 100-bp windows cover the 10 kb flanking these regions. H3K27me3 signals are summarized for Ezh2+/+ melanoma cells, Ezh2Y641F/+ melanoma cells and Ezh2Y641F/+ melanoma cells that were treated with JQEZ5.  Full size image (162 KB) Previous Figures index We next performed hierarchical clustering of these samples by genome-wide, non-overlapping 5-kb windows that exhibited dynamic H3K27me3 marks between Ezh2+/+ and matched Ezh2Y641F/+ cells based on a standard deviation threshold (Supplementary Fig. 12b,c). This analysis revealed two major clusters: one with increased H3K27me3 in Ezh2+/+ samples, and a larger cluster with increased H3K27me3 in Ezh2Y641F/+ samples. These clusters were present in both B cells and melanoma cells with substantial overlap of dynamic regions (Supplementary Fig. 12b,c). The finding of a large number of loci with dense H3K27me3 in Ezh2+/+ samples that is lost in Ezh2Y641F/+ B cells or melanoma was unexpected given the presumed hypermorphic activity of the mutant enzyme; yet such loci were even more obvious using a 'peak calling' algorithm (MACS47), which assigns statistical significance to each dynamic peak. A 'volcano plot' of the log-transformed fold change of H3K27me3 peak signal versus log-transformed P value demonstrated that the peaks with the most highly significant change between Ezh2+/+ and Ezh2Y641F/+ samples were those that decreased 2- to 4-fold in Ezh2Y641F/+ cells. Similarly to that seen in the PCA, there was a significant restoration of the WT peak pattern in Ezh2Y641F/+ melanoma cells after JQEZ5 treatment (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 12a). We considered the possibility that this apparent decrease in peaks in Ezh2Y641F/+ cells reflected an artifact of normalization, as a relative increase in genome-wide H3K27me3 could dilute the intensity of the highest peaks seen in Ezh2+/+ cells. However, we discounted this possibility for two reasons. Firstly, the fold decrease of H3K27me3 at certain loci (Fig. 5b) greatly exceeded the global increase in H3K27me3 by western analysis (Fig. 1b,i), suggesting that dilution alone was an improbable cause. Secondly, the observed changes in peak height correlated with RNA expression at specific loci, for example, the marked increase in HoxC expression in Ezh2Y641F/+ B cells correlated with H3K27me3 loss at this locus (Fig. 5c), whereas Igf1 repression in Ezh2Y641F/+ melanoma cells lines occurred in the setting of greatly increased H3K27me3 at this locus (Fig. 5c). These observations suggest that the expression of mutant Ezh2 causes a global redistribution of H3K27me3, from highly focal peaks apparent in the Ezh2+/+ samples to a greater number of broader, less focal peaks in the Ezh2Y641F/+ samples, with attendant changes in gene expression.  We analyzed the effects of Ezh2Y641F expression on the distribution of H3K27me3 at promoter regions, TSS and gene bodies. Toward that end, we rank-ordered transcripts by level of expression in Ezh2+/+ samples and averaged the normalized H3K27me3 intensity ± 5 kb around the TSS for the top and bottom quartiles of expression (Fig. 5d). Consistent with previous work48, this analysis showed increased H3K27me3 flanking the TSS of genes with the lowest expression (black), with an obvious 'spike' of H3K27me3 immediately 3′ to the TSS. Expression of Ezh2Y641F led to a relative decrease in H3K27me3 in the least transcribed genes, with little effect on H3K27me3 at transcripts in the highest quartile of expression. This observation suggests that the increased expression of some transcripts in Ezh2Y641F-mutant cells (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) results from a paradoxical loss of H3K27me3 around the TSSs of certain PRC2-repressed genes.  We next analyzed mean normalized H3K27me3 signal around the TSSs (±5 kb) of genes that showed a significant change in expression between Ezh2+/+ and Ezh2Y641F/+ cells (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Genes that were upregulated in the presence of Ezh2Y641F in both B cells and melanoma cell lines showed decreased H3K27me3 signals around the TSS, particularly immediately 3′ to the TSS (Fig. 5e, left). In contrast, genes that were downregulated in the presence of Ezh2Y641F showed increased H3K27me3 signals, which started (on average) >2 kb downstream of TSSs (Fig. 5e, right). These results are consistent with a prior report suggesting that H3K27me3 marks in the gene body are strongly repressive, whereas H3K27me3 marks in promoters are also in actively transcribed genes48. To further consider this possibility, we analyzed the presence of H3K27me3 along the gene body (from the TSS to the transcription termination site (TTS)) of transcripts that were differentially expressed between Ezh2+/+ and Ezh2Y641F/+ samples (Fig. 5f). In contrast to the effects of Ezh2 mutations around the TSS, we observed a modest effect of Ezh2Y641F on upregulated genes (P = 0.07) but a marked increase (P = 1.7 × 10−15) of H3K27me3 signals in the gene bodies of downregulated genes (Fig. 5f).  Finally, we analyzed the effect of the Ezh2Y641F mutation on the entire genome, focusing on melanoma cell lines. To this end, we identified broad H3K27me3 domains in Ezh2+/+ cells across the genome, and then compared the mean, normalized H3K27me3 signal 10 kb upstream and downstream of these domains in Ezh2+/+ versus Ezh2Y641F/+ samples. Consistent with our peak-calling analysis (Fig. 5b), we observed a dramatic decrease in H3K27me3 signals in Ezh2Y641F/+ samples, which was mostly restored after treatment with JQEZ5. Notably, however, we observed an increase in H3K27me3 signals that extended for more than 10 kb both 5′ and 3′ to these domains in Ezh2Y641F/+ samples (Fig. 5g). In aggregate, these results demonstrate that the Ezh2Y641F mutant enzyme causes a global redistribution of H3K27me3 away from focal peaks (for example, near the TSS) across broad regions including gene bodies and intergenic regions.  Discussion Abstract• Introduction• Results• Discussion• Methods• Accession codes• References• Acknowledgments• Author information• Supplementary information Consistent with prior work21, we show that, under physiological conditions, global H3K27me3 levels are elevated in cells expressing Ezh2Y641F, consistent with a model of increased enzymatic activity. However, using H3K27me3 ChIP-seq analysis, we provide evidence that the Tyr641Phe mutation does not monotonically increase H3K27me3, but rather redistributes the H3K27me3 mark across the genome, with complex effects on transcription. Through integrated analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq, we observe loci in Ezh2Y641F samples that show reduced H3K27me3 and increased gene expression, and vice versa. In particular, we note that the effects are not uniform with regard to genomic regions—the mutation seems to favor H3K27me3 over large regions (at gene bodies and intergenic regions) at the expense of focal peaks near the TSS. Although the mechanistic basis for this preference in unclear, the recent solution of the crystal structure of the yeast (Chaetomium thermophilum) PRC2 complex provides tantalizing clues49. In that study, the authors suggest that WT EZH2 is allosterically activated after EED binds H3K27me3, through reorganization of the complex that alters the lysine substrate channel of the enzyme in a manner similar to that by the Ala682 SET-domain-encoding mutation50. This structure suggests that the yeast amino acid (Tyr826) homologous to Tyr646 also participates in the formation of this substrate channel, providing the possibility that this mutation reduces the need for H3K27me3-bound EED stimulation of the enzymatic complex, thereby creating a more promiscuous complex. Such a complex is expected to increase H3K27me3 at most nucleosomes. If some cofactor (such as SAM) for trimethylation were limiting, however, then such a complex might also show reduced H3K27me3 at focal peaks that perhaps more strongly require the stimulatory effects of the H3K27me3–EED interaction in cells expressing the WT complex. Regardless of the precise mechanistic details, however, the observations that Ezh2Y641F expression decreases H3K27me3 at many loci (Fig. 5b–g and Supplementary Fig. 12), and that this effect is largely reversed by treatment with an EZH2 inhibitor (Fig. 5b,g and Supplementary Fig. 12a), are not consistent with the notion that this is a strictly hypermorphic allele. Rather, we believe the allele should more properly be considered neomorphic, perhaps resulting from reduced requirements for H3K27me3-mediated autoactivation.  Therapeutically, these results have direct implications for human cancers harboring mutations in the region encoding the Ezh2 SET domain. The overlap of gene expression signatures of Ezh2 activation and Myc repression in B lineage cancers (Fig. 4b) and the lack of cooperation between Myc overexpression and Ezh2 mutations in lymphomagenesis (Fig. 1e) suggests the intriguing possibility that EZH2 mediates some of the transforming effects of Myc in lymphoma. Just as recent reports suggesting that mutations in BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1)51, AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A)52 and SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily b, member 1 (SMARCB1)53 predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors, this finding suggests a rationale for testing EZH2 inhibitors in B cell neoplasms that are characterized by strong Myc activation. Additionally, we report a newly developed, potent pharmacologic EZH2 inhibitor, JQEZ5, with excellent in vitro and in vivo properties and that demonstrates marked in vivo antitumor activity in a faithful model of Ezh2-mutant cancer (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 6). Finally, the discovery of the exquisite and specific cooperation between activating genetic events of EZH2 and BRAF, but not NRAS (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 5), predicts synergistic activity of combined therapy with RAF inhibitors (such as dabrafenib or vemurafenib) and EZH2 inhibitors in this heretofore unappreciated melanoma subtype that represents 3–9% of all individuals with melanoma.

Animals were housed in an AAALAC International–accredited facility and treated in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for animal research of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  Generation of the Ezh2Y641F allele. The allele was generated by homologous-recombination-based targeting techniques into hybrid C57BL6/129SvEv embryonic stem (ES) cells; germline transmission was confirmed, and allele validation was performed, as shown in Figure 1. The neomycin selection cassette was excised by crossing the Ezh2Y641F mice to C57BL/6 FlpE (flippase-enhanced form) mice to effect recombination using the flippase recognition site (FRT). Mice with the conditional allele (Ezh2Y641F) were crossed to mice with the tissue-specific Cre driver alleles (CD19Cre/+), a B lymphocyte–specific Cre knock-in strain20, and Tyr-CreERT2, a melanocyte-specific transgenic strain30. All other strains used were on the C57BL/6 background.  Transplants of melanoma cell lines and therapy studies. For melanocyte-specific somatic recombination in mice that carried the Tyr-CreERT2 allele, mice were treated with topical administration of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT) as previously reported30, 31. Tumor transplants were carried out in female mice that were homozygous for the severe combined immune deficiency spontaneous mutation Prkdcscid on the NOD background (NOD/SCID mice). Tumor size was within the size permitted by the UNC IACUC committee. 5.0 × 105 cells were injected intradermally with Tyr-CreERT2BrafV600EPtenL/+Ezh2Y641F/+ or control Tyr-CreERT2BrafV600EPtenL/LEzh2+/+ mutant melanoma cells in 100 μl PBS/matrigel. Once tumors reached 10 mm3 in size (2 weeks), mice were randomly assigned to four treatment groups: vehicle-treated, JQEZ5 (50 mg/kg), dabrafenib (oral gavage, 25 mg/kg), or combined dabrafenib and JQEZ5. JQEZ5 was dissolved in 20% captisol at an adjusted pH of 4 and administered intraperitoneally. Tumor volume was measured twice a week.  Retroviral transductions and adaptive transfers of lymphoma cells. Donor mice were injected with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 6 d before bone marrow harvest. At day 6, total bone marrow cells were stained with a biotinylated Sca1-specific antibody, followed by treatment with anti-biotin magnetic beads, and sorting using an AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec). Sca1+ hematopoietic progenitors were plated into each well of a 24-well plate (100,000 cells per well) and transduced with a retrovirus expressing the gene of interest at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in the presence of polybrene and the cytokines thrombopoietin (Tpo) and stem cell factor (Scf). Cells were spin-infected for 2 h at room temperature, and incubated for another hour at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, washed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) without serum and injected into lethally irradiated recipient mice (50,000 cells per mouse). An X-RAD 320 instrument (Precision X-ray) was used to lethally irradiate mice at a dose of 10 Gy. After the mice developed lymphoma, they were treated with JQEZ5 (50 mg/kg) daily for 6 d, after which the mice were euthanized and analyzed for the presence of disease.  Blood counts and flow cytometry (FACS) analyses. Blood was collected into EDTA-containing tubes and analyzed on a Hemavet Analyzer (Drew Scientific). For flow cytometry analysis (FACS), a single-cell suspension was created, and cells were washed and stained with the appropriate antibodies in HBSS with 2% FBS. Cells were analyzed in HBSS + 2% serum and 0.4 μg/ml propidium iodide. FACS of bone marrow, spleens, blood and lymph nodes was performed using the CyAn (Beckman Coulter) and LSRII (BD) flow cytometers. FACS data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc.).  Germinal-center analysis. Age- and sex-matched mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 μg NP hapten conjugated to chicken gamma globulin (NP–CGG; Biosearch Technologies) diluted in Imject alum adjuvant (Thermo Scientific). Fourteen days later, a single-cell suspension was made from the animals' spleens, and germinal center expansion was analyzed by FACS using antibodies against B220–Pacific Blue, GL7–FITC and FAS–PE.  Histology. Tissue was harvested and placed in 10% formalin overnight. It was then transferred to, and stored in, 70% ethanol until sectioning. Tissue was embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathologic assessment. Histopathology slides were reviewed by a board-certified hematopathologist (Y.F.).  Cell culture. Melanoma tumors from mice were harvested and disaggregated using a sterile blade, treated with collagenase for 90 min in a rotating incubator, followed by 0.25% Trypsin for 5 min, washed with PBS, and plated in a 6-cm dish with IMDM (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium) containing 10% serum and penicillin–streptomycin. For cell proliferation assays, seeding density was determined for each cell line, and cell proliferation was assessed using a 96-well plate format. Drugs were dissolved in DMSO, and cell growth was monitored using Alamar Blue (Life Technologies). Melanoma-derived cell lines were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine and non-essential amino acids. Primary human melanocytes were purchased from Lonza (CC-2586), grown in MGM-4 Bulletkit medium (CC-3249) and treated according to supplier's instructions.  Lentivirus production and transduction. Human NRASQ61K, BRAFV600 and PIK3CACAAX plasmids were subcloned into pLenti5.5-IRES-GFP. Virus was produced and packaged in 293T cells by cotransfecting the pLenti vector with vectors expressing envelope protein VSVG (vesicular stomatitis virus G protein) and the packaging construct ΔNRF. Virus was harvested at 48 h and 72 h after transfection, and fresh virus was used to transduce primary human melanocytes. Cells were harvested and assayed 10 d after transduction, when >95% of the cells were GFP+.  Knockdown experiments. GIPZ shRNA lentiviral constructs were used to knock down Ezh2 (GE Dharmacon). Virus was titered in the melanoma cell lines of interest (855 and 480). Cell lines 855 and 480 were subsequently transduced at a MOI of 1, and puromycin selection was initiated 48 h after transduction. Percentage of knockdown was assayed when >99% of cells were GFP+. GIPZ shRNA lentiviral constructs were unsuccessful in knocking down Ezh1. RNA interference (RNAi) technology was then used to successfully knock down Ezh1 (Silencer, 4390771; Life Technologies). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Life Technologies) and harvested 48 h later to assay for knockdown and levels of histone methylation.  Histone isolation and immunoblotting. Histones were isolated using acid extraction with 0.2 N HCl and quantitated using DC protein assay (Pierce). Standard western blot procedures were used. Antibodies to the following proteins were used: Ezh2, H3 and H3K27me3 (Cell Signaling). Blots were visualized and band intensity was quantitated using a LICOR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System.  Biochemical assays. Enzyme activity was determined by using the 5-protein PRC2 complex, EZH1 and EZH2 (WT or mutant), EED, SUZ12, AEBP2 and RbAp48, and methyltransferase activity was assessed by measuring incorporation of [3H]methyl groups on biotinylated histone H321–44 peptides via scintillation proximity assays, as previously described21.  Quantitative RT–PCR analysis. Total RNA and cDNA were prepared using the RNeasyPlus Mini Kit (Qiagen) and ImPro-II reverse transcriptase (Promega), respectively, according to the manufacturers' instructions. Real-time PCR was performed with a QuantStudio Real-Time system (Life Technologies), using iTaq Universal SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad).  RNA sequencing and analysis. RNA was prepared from CD19+ cells from the spleen of four CD19Cre/+ and four CD19Cre/+Ezh2Y641F/+ mice using the RNAEasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen). RNA-seq libraries were prepared using TruSeq RNA kit v2 from Illumina and validated using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2000 sequencer (Illumina) at the UNC Genome-sequencing Core. Paired-end reads were aligned against the mm9 reference genome using TopHat version 1.3.1, and transcript isoform abundance was computed using cufflinks 1.1.0. Differential expression between Ezh2+/+ and Ezh2Y641F/+ samples was computed using the DEseq package available through bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org).  Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing and analysis. For B cell ChIP, CD19+ cells were isolated by using the AutoMACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec) to a purity of >95%. Melanoma cell lines 855 (Tyr-CreERT2BrafV600EPtenL/+Ezh2+/+), 855D (Tyr-CreERT2BrafV600EPtenL/+Ezh2Y641F/+), 480 (Tyr-CreERT2BrafV600EPtenL/+Ezh2+/+) and 480D (Tyr-CreERT2BrafV600EPtenL/+Ezh2Y641F/+) were cultured with or without 1μM JQEZ5. 10 million cells were used for each H3K27me3 (Millipore, 07-449) ChIP. Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq ChIP kit (Illumina) and multiplexed for sequencing. 50-bp single-end reads were sequenced on an Illumina HS2000. Reads were aligned to the reference mouse genome (mm10) using BWA (Burrows–Wheeler aligner). Sites of significant H3K27me3 ChIP enrichment, relative to that of input control, were identified by using MACS2. ChIP and input control signals were then computed for every base pair across the entire genome. For summary plots around transcriptional start sites, we computed the average IP/input ratio at nucleotide resolution surrounding annotated TSSs. For gene-level summary plots we counted the total number of reads in both IP and input control falling within a gene unit (TSS to TTS) and computed the IP/input ratio for each gene. Each of these coordinate based summarizations of read density were computed using BEDtools54. Broader H3K27me3 domains were identified in untreated WT melanoma cells by merging two or more H3K27me3 peaks within 10 kb together using Galaxy55. The meta-analysis of signal over these domains was performed by computing signal over 100 variable-width windows spanning the length of each broad H3K27me3 domain, as well as over 100 100-bp windows (10 kb) flanking these domains. Domains shorter than 100 bp or falling less than 10 kb from the start or end of chromosomes were excluded.  Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). GSEA was performed as described here56. Enrichment of differentially expressed genes in WT versus Ezh2Y641F/+ mutant cells was carried out against a pre-ranked gene list using the log2 ratio of expression of Ezh2Y641F versus that of WT.  Statistical analysis. All results are expressed as the mean ± s.e.m. Exact sample sizes are indicated in each figure, with no less than five mice per group. A two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test was used to determine statistical analysis between genotypes and test groups. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were created and analyzed using Prism (GraphPad Software), which used the log-rank test to calculate significance. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, and data analysis was not blinded.  Antibodies used for FACS and western blots. Antibodies to the following proteins were used: CD45R/B220 (clone RA3-6B2, 1:100, eBioscience), CD3 (145-2c11, 1:100, eBioscience), CD45.2 (clone 104, 1:100, eBioscience), CD4 (clone GK1.5, 1:100, eBioscience), CD8 (clone 53-6.7, 1:100, eBioscience), CD19 (clone eBio1D3, 1:100, eBioscience), CD5 (clone 53-7.3, 1:100, eBioscience), CD21 (clone eBio4E3, 1:100, eBioscience), CD43 (clone eBioR2/60, 1:100, eBioscience), IgD (clone 11-26, 1:100, eBioscience), Gr1 (clone RB6-8C5, 1:100, eBioscience), IgM (clone 11f41, 1:100, eBioscience), GL-7 (clone GL-7, 1:100, eBioscience), Mac1 (clone M1/70, 1:100, eBioscience), Ezh2 (clone AC22, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling), Ezh1 (1:500, Abcam), H3K27me3 (clone C36B11, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling) and H3 (clone 12079, 1:1,000, Abcam). EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) is a critical enzymatic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which trimethylates histone H3 (H3K27) to mediate gene repression. Somatic mutations, overexpression and hyperactivation of EZH2 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several forms of cancer. In particular, recurrent gain-of-function mutations targeting EZH2 Y641 occur most frequently in follicular lymphoma and aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and are associated with H3K27me3 hyperactivation, which contributes to lymphoma pathogenesis. However, the post-translational mechanisms of EZH2 regulation are not completely understood. Here we show that EZH2 is a novel interactor and substrate of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP (FBXW1). β-TrCP ubiquitinates EZH2 and Jak2-mediated phosphorylation on Y641 directs β-TrCP-mediated EZH2 degradation. RNA interference-mediated silencing of β-TrCP or inhibition of Jak2 results in EZH2 stabilization with attendant increase in H3K27 trimethylation activity. Importantly, the EZH2Y641 mutants recurrently implicated in lymphoma pathogenesis are unable to bind β-TrCP. Further, endogenous EZH2Y641 mutants in lymphoma cells exhibit increased EZH2 stability and H3K27me3 hyperactivity. Our studies demonstrate that β-TrCP has an important role in controlling H3K27 trimethylation activity and lymphoma pathogenesis by targeting EZH2 for degradation.  Keywords: EZH2; SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase; protein degradation; lymphoma Top of page Introduction Epigenetic regulators including the polycomb group (PcG) of proteins have a critical role in the pathogenesis and evolution of several types of cancer.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 PcG proteins are also known to regulate self-renewal of somatic and cancer stem cells.5, 6 Polycomb repressor complexes make defined but reversible changes in gene expression pattern in a context-dependent manner and their activity largely depends upon the formation of complete repressor complex.7 Hence, the length of activity and target selectivity of the complex may depend upon protein turnover of the complex. Assembled together, PcG proteins form two large protein complexes, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), that act in concert to effect gene repression.8  Polycomb complexes repress target genes by covalent modifications of histone tails catalyzed by PRC1 (histone 2A Lys 119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119ub1)) and PRC2 (H3K27me2, me3) as well as direct chromatin compaction.8, 9, 10 Efficient H3K27 methylation requires the cooperation of several PRC2 core components, including EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction via its SET domain and establishes chromatin marks associated with gene silencing.11 Although overexpression of EZH2 and its increased H3K27 methylation have generally been associated with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, recurrent somatic mutations in EZH2 have been recently reported in germinal center B-cell (GCB)-derived lymphomas (follicular lymphoma and the GCB subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). These mutations, which replace a single tyrosine in the SET domain of the EZH2 protein (Y641), occur in 21.7% of GCB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 27.6% of follicular lymphomas and are absent from activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.12, 13 This mutation acts as a disease-associated gain-of-function mutation in EZH2.14 Consequently, B-cell lymphoma cell lines and lymphoma samples harboring heterozygous EZH2Y641 mutations exhibit increased histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) activity as well as a lymphoproliferative phenotype with expansion of the GCB-cell compartment.14 Significantly, inhibition of H3K27me3 activity is emerging as a promising approach for targeted therapy of EZH2 dysregulated cancers.14, 15, 16, 17, 18  Although extensive research has been conducted to understand the role of polycomb group of proteins in cancer pathogenesis, few studies have been aimed at understanding the post-translational regulation of these proteins. We and others have recently reported that core components of polycomb group proteins are regulated at post-translational level by the ubiquitin proteasome system.19, 20, 21 Skp1/cullin1/F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complexes are the largest family of multicomponent RING E3 ubiquitin ligases that control the degradation of many important regulatory proteins and have been implicated in the regulation of epigenetic regulators.22, 23, 24, 25 Specifically in this regard, we demonstrated that BMI1, the catalytically important subunit of the PRC1 complex, is regulated by SCFβ-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase (henceforth referred to as β-TrCP).19 Reports indicate that the PRC2 catalytic subunit EZH2 is stabilized by inhibition of the proteasomal pathway,7, 20, 21, 26 including post-translational regulation of excess PRC2 components by E3 ubiquitin ligase pRAJA120 and post-translational regulation of EZH2 during neuronal differentiation by Smurf2 E3 ligase.21 However, the mechanism of EZH2 degradation and its implication in PRC2-mediated methyl transferase activity in a cancer-specific context is not fully understood. In the present study, we report that the cullin1-RING E3 ligase β-TrCP has a key role in regulating H3K27me by modulating EZH2 stability. Our results also reveal an unconventional recognition of tyrosine 641 residue in EZH2 by β-TrCP.  Top of page Results EZH2 undergoes proteasome-mediated degradation To examine the components of PRC2 complex that are regulated by proteasomal turnover, we first examined the levels of each core component in the absence of other critical core components in the complex. MCF7 cells were subjected to RNA interference (RNAi) SMART pool-mediated knockdown of PRC2 core components EZH2, SUZ12 (suppressor of zeste 12 homolog), EED (embryonic ectoderm development) or scrambled control for 72 h followed by treatment with vehicle control or MG132 for 6 h. Western blot analysis of cell lysates indicated that the EZH2 catalytic component of PRC2 undergoes degradation in the absence of other two components SUZ12 or EED and its levels can be rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Supplementary Figure S1A). To examine the turnover of EZH2 in the presence or absence of a functional proteasome system, we determined the half-life of EZH2 in MCF7 cells by inhibiting the de novo protein synthesis using cycloheximide (CHX) in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Our data indicated that like the known proteasomal target CDC25A, the half-life of EZH2 is prolonged in the presence of MG132 (Figure 1a). Figure 1.

(a) MCF7 cells were treated with DMSO or MG132 (10 μm) for 1 h before CHX addition and cells were harvested at indicated time points. Whole-cell lysates were immunoblotted for EZH2, CDC25A and β-actin. Quantification of western blot (WB) images was performed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) and is presented in graphical form. (b) Cullin1 interacts with endogenous EZH2 in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with Flag-tagged cullins as indicated and after 48 h were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 8 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using Flag resin and analyzed by WB for indicated proteins. (c) Concentration-dependent increase in the expression of functionally defective dominant-negative cullin1 mutant (V5-tagged C-terminal truncation Δcullin 1 amino-acid residues 1–452) results in the accumulation of endogenous EZH2 in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with increasing concentrations of functionally defective cullin1. Cells were harvested after 48 h of transfection and cell lysates were analyzed for indicated proteins using WB analyses. (d) Cullin1 knockdown using three different shRNA specific for cullin1 results in EZH2 protein accumulation in MCF7 cells. Lentiviral particles containing shRNA targeting different regions of cullin1 were used to stably knockdown cullin1 in MCF7 cells. After selection with puromycin 0.5 μg/ml for 3 days, cells were harvested in Laemmli sample buffer and after sonication cell lysates were analyzed by WB analysis as indicated.  Full figure and legend (99K)  Multi-subunit cullin–RING complexes comprise the largest known class of E3 ligases.27 We first examined whether a specific cullin-RING complex is involved in controlling EZH2 degradation. To test this hypothesis, Flag-tagged cullin1, cullin2, cullin3, cullin4A, cullin4B, cullin5 and cullin7 were transfected in HEK293 cells. After 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 6 h followed by Flag immunoprecipitation (IP) and analyzed by western blotting. Results demonstrated that EZH2 (endogenous) specifically interacts with cullin1, but not with any of the other six members of the cullin family (Figure 1b). To further investigate a possible role for cullin1 RING ligases in EZH2 proteolysis, V5-tagged dominant-negative cullin1 (1–452ΔC) was transiently expressed in HEK293 or HeLa cells. After 48 h of transfection, cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting. Overexpression of dominant-negative cullin1 resulted in the accumulation of EZH2 protein in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293 (Figure 1c) and HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S1B). As expected, β-catenin, a known substrate of the cullin1-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL), also accumulated following the expression of dominant-negative cullin1 (Figure 1c). Nedd8 modification is required for cullin activation to induce a conformational change that increases the proximity between the E2 enzyme and the substrate.28 Accordingly, we demonstrated that treatment of HeLa cells with MLN4924, a selective inhibitor of Nedd8-activating enzyme, followed by CHX treatment accumulated EZH2 steady-state levels (Supplementary Figure S1C). Moreover, depletion of endogenous cullin1 by stable expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting cullin1 led to EZH2 protein accumulation in MCF7 cells (Figure 1d), indicating that a cullin1-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase may have a role in the regulation of EZH2 stability.  EZH2 interacts specifically with β-TrCP Cullin1 associates with F-box proteins via an adaptor protein Skp1 to establish a functional multicomponent SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. F-box proteins are the substrate binding units of the SCF E3 ligase complex.29, 30 We sought to explore which F-box protein complexed with cullin1 is responsible for EZH2 recognition. We examined a panel of eight different F-box proteins for their interaction with endogenous EZH2 using co-IP. Briefly, Flag-tagged F-box proteins β-TrCP (Fbxw1), Fbxw2, Fbxw4, Fbxw5, Fbxo7, Fbxo22 and FbxL1 (Skp2) were expressed in 293T cells. After 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with MG132 for 6 h. Cells were harvested in IP buffer and cell lysates were subjected to Flag IP followed by western blot analysis. The results indicated that among all F-box proteins tested, β-TrCP demonstrated exclusive interaction with EZH2 (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure S2A). Moreover, PRC2 core component SUZ12 also co-precipitated with β-TrCP. Figure 2. Figure 2 - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author β-TrCP interacts with and regulates EZH2 proteolysis. (a) Endogenous EZH2 exclusively interact with exogenous β-TrCP among several different F-box proteins. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with Flag-tagged F-box proteins as indicated and after 48 h were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 8 h Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using Flag resin and analyzed by western blot (WB) analysis for indicated proteins. (b) Endogenous β-TrCP immunoprecipitates endogenous EZH2 in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 8 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-β-TrCP antibody and immunoblotted for indicated proteins. (c) β-TrCP–EZH2 interaction is lost in the absence of substrate binding motif of β-TrCP. HEK293 cells were transfected with TAP-HA-tagged β-TrCP WT and mutants as indicated, and after 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 8 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin resin and analyzed by WB analysis for indicated proteins. (d) Illustration of WT EZH2 with its putative domain structure and SUZ12-binding domain deletion mutant of EZH2 (ΔSUZ12BD). (e) EZH2 directly interacts with β-TrCP independent of its association with SUZ12. HEK293 cells were transfected with TAP-HA-tagged β-TrCP-WT as well as Flag-tagged EZH2 WT or ΔSUZ12BD, and after 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 8 h. Cells lysated were immunoprecipitated using streptavidin or Flag resin and analyzed by WB analysis as indicated. (f) Knockdown of β-TrCP stabilizes EZH2 protein. MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with siRNA SMART pool targeting β-TrCP for 72 h followed by DMSO or CHX (100 μg/ml) treatment for stated time points. Cell lysates were examined for indicated proteins by WB analysis. Quantification of WB analysis images was performed using ImageJ software (NIH) and is presented in graphical form. The data represent averages of three independent experiments, and error bars represent the standard deviations from these averages.  Full figure and legend (180K)  Next, we sought to explore if β-TrCP interacts with EZH2 indirectly by binding to another component of the large chromatin modulator complex. To do this, we first expressed tandem affinity purification-hemagglutinin (TAP-HA)-tagged β-TrCP along with two other F-box proteins, Fbxo45 and Skp2, in HEK293 cells. After 48 h, cells were harvested and cell lysates were treated with micrococcal nuclease to digest the large chromatin complex into small nucleosome size particles. These lysates were examined for efficient digestion of nucleosome particles of ~200 bp by agarose gel analysis, and then subjected to TAP-tagged IP for F-box proteins and examined for co-immunoprecipitating proteins. As shown in Supplementary Figures S2B and C, β-TrCP showed interaction with endogenous PRC2 components EZH2 and SUZ12 but not EED or EZH1. Moreover, all F-box proteins efficiently immunoprecipitated their respective protein complex component Skp1. BMI1, YAP and β-catenin, known targets of β-TrCP, and p27, a known target of Skp2, were used as positive controls as indicated (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figures S2B and C). Importantly, we demonstrated that IP of endogenous β-TrCP co-precipitated endogenous EZH2 in HEK293 cells (Figure 2b), and reciprocally, IP of endogenous EZH2 co-precipitated endogenous β-TrCP (Supplementary Figure S3).  β-TrCP binding to its enzymatic substrates is largely facilitated by its 7th WD repeat motif.31 Particularly, mutation of amino-acid R474 residing in the 7th WD repeat motif of β-TrCP (ΔWD7) is known to abolish its interaction with its known substrate β-catenin.31 Hence, the EZH2–β-TrCP interaction was examined using TAP-HA-tagged β-TrCP wild-type (WT) or mutants with deletion of the 7th WD repeat motif or R474A mutant of β-TrCP. Briefly, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with TAP-HA-tagged β-TrCP WT or its mutants (ΔWD7 and R474A). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and TAP IPs were performed. Results demonstrated that deletion or mutation of the critical arginine residue in β-TrCP abolished its binding with EZH2 (Figure 2c). As expected, β-catenin, a known substrate, co-precipitated with WT β-TrCP. In addition, the interaction of SUZ12 with β-TrCP was also abolished in the presence of the β-TrCP mutant R474A and ΔWD. Hence, to rule out an indirect interaction of EZH2-β-TrCP through SUZ12, we generated a Flag-tagged EZH2 deletion mutant (EZH2 ΔSUZ12 BD) that does not contain the SUZ12-binding region (Figure 2d).32 Flag IP experiments demonstrated that the EZH2 mutant that is not able to interact with SUZ12 retained its binding with β-TrCP, indicating a direct interaction of EZH2 with β-TrCP (Figure 2e). As knockdown of SUZ12 promotes rapid proteolysis of EZH2 (Supplementary Figure S1),7 we next determined if this proteolysis is mediated by β-TrCP. This experiment showed that EZH2 degradation promoted by loss of SUZ12 is rescued by further knockdown of β-TrCP (Supplementary Figure S4A). To examine if SUZ12 silencing affects EZH2–β-TrCP interaction, 293T cells were transfected with SUZ12 small interfering RNA (siRNA) SMART pool for 48 h followed by TAP-HA β-TrCP overexpression for another 48 h Cell lysates were subjected to TAP IP. These experiments reveal a modest enhancement of the EZH2–β-TrCP interaction after SUZ12 silencing as compared with scramble control (Supplementary Figure S4B).  β-TrCP regulates EZH2 degradation The specific interaction of the β-TrCP with endogenous EZH2 prompted us to investigate whether β-TrCP regulates EZH2 proteolysis by proteasomal degradation. First, we examined the role of β-TrCP in EZH2 degradation using RNAi. MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with scrambled or siRNA SMART pool specifically targeting β-TrCP. After 72 h of transfection, examination of the half-life of EZH2 using CHX chase experiments revealed stabilization and prolongation of the half-life of the EZH2 protein upon knockdown of β-TrCP (Figure 2f). Other PRC2 core component SUZ12 also show modest stabilization upon β-TrCP silencing. However, there is no alteration in the half-life of EED, which was observed following β-TrCP knockdown. Proteolysis of β-catenin, a known substrate of β-TrCP was used as positive control. The β-TrCP known substrate β-catenin also shows significant increase in half-life by β-TrCP knockdown (Figure 2f). Further, we tested whether dominant-negative mutant of β-TrCP (ΔF-β-TrCP) can abrogate the EZH2 ubiquitination. For this experiment, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with vector or ΔF-β-TrCP as well as HA-tagged ubiquitin. After 48 h of transfection, cells were harvested following 6 h of MG132 treatment in IP buffer and endogenous EZH2 were immunoprecipitated and examined by western blot analysis. Results suggest that the expression of ΔF-β-TrCP significantly reduced EZH2 ubiquitination (Supplementary Figure S5). EZH2Y641 mutation abrogates β-TrCP-mediated degradation Although overexpression of EZH2 and increased H3K27me have generally been associated with both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, somatic heterozygous missense mutations within the catalytic SET domain of EZH2 that alter a single highly evolutionarily conserved tyrosine residue Tyr 641 (Y641F, Y641N, Y641S and Y641H) were recently reported in follicular lymphoma and GCB subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.12, 13 Mutation at Y641 of EZH2 contributes a gain-of-function status with increased H3K27me activity.14 We postulated that this mutation could affect the protein turnover of EZH2. To investigate this possibility, we examined the half-life of EZH2 in HEK293 cells overexpressing EZH2 WT or Y641N mutant. Our results revealed that EZH2 Y641N mutant showed prolonged half-life of EZH2 when compared with EZH2 WT (Figure 3a). Next, we examined the half-life of EZH2 in cell lines that harbor heterozygous mutations at Y641 (SUDHL 4 (Y641S), SUDHL 6 (Y641N), L428 (Y641N) and KARPAS 422 (Y641N)) along with others expressing wild-type Y641 (SUDHL 5 (WT), SUDHL 8 (WT)). These studies revealed that in cell lines with Y641 mutation, EZH2 exhibited longer half-life than those with WT EZH2. In this regard, EZH2Y641 mutants exhibited stable protein expression up to 12 h after CHX treatment, while EZH2 WT demonstrated quicker turnover with half-life of ~8 h (Figure 3b). To investigate the possibility that delay in protein turnover of EZH2 is contributed by β-TrCP, we next examined if mutations at Y641 residue of EZH2 affects its interaction with β-TrCP. To address this question, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-Flag-tagged EZH2 WT, EZH2 Y641N or EZH2 Y641F mutants along with vector control. After 48 h, cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) for 6 h. Cells were harvested and cell lysate was subjected to Flag co-IP. The results demonstrated that EZH2 WT interacts with endogenous β-TrCP but EZH2 Y641N and Y641F mutants do not (Figure 3c). Further, mutation at Y641 in EZH2 markedly reduced β-TrCP induced in vivo as well as in vitro ubiquitination (Figure 3d and Supplementary Figure S6). Figure 3.

As compared with control, λ-phosphatase treatment diminished β-TrCP interaction with EZH2, while the interaction was restored following λ-phosphatase treatment in the presence of phosphatase inhibitor (Figure 4a). These results indicate that Y641 residue in EZH2 is critical for its binding to β-TrCP, and can potentially be phosphorylated. We predicted that tyrosine kinase Jak2, which recognizes YXX[L/I/V] motif for phosphorylation of substrate, may be responsible for EZH2 phosphorylation at Y641 residue33 (Figure 4b). To test whether Jak2-mediated phosphorylation on EZH2 promote its proteolysis, we treated HeLa cells with Jak2 inhibitor ruxolitinib at different concentrations as indicated. Jak2 inhibition resulted in the accumulation of basal level of EZH2 protein (Figure 4c). Further, we examined the role of Jak2 inhibition in EZH2 degradation. HeLa cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ruxolitinib (10 nm) overnight and subjected to CHX chase experiments. Results revealed stabilization and prolongation of the EZH2 protein half-life upon ruxolitinib-mediated Jak2 inhibition (Figure 4c). To ascertain the role of Jak2 phosphorylation on EZH2–β-TrCP interaction, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with TAP-HA tagged β-TrCP, and after 48 h of transfection, cells treated with DMSO or ruxolitinib at indicated concentration. TAP IP followed by western blot analysis indicated that Jak2 inhibition significantly abrogated EZH2–β-TrCP interaction (Figure 4d). Treatment of ruxolitinib inhibited phosphorylation of STAT5b, a known downstream target of Jak2, as a proof of Jak2 inhibition. To assess the phosphorylation by Jak2, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion of C terminus (amino-acid residues 580–668) of EZH2 encompassing Y641 residue-mediated Jak2 recognition motif were used in in vitro protein kinase assays. EZH2 WT fragment was phosphorylated by Jak2 but mutation of Y641 to asparagine or phenylalanine resulted in the loss of phosphorylation. No phosphorylation of the control GST protein was observed (Figure 4e). These data indicate that EZH2 protein can be specifically phosphorylated at Y641 residue by Jak2 and this phosphorylation promotes EZH2–β-TrCP interaction leading to EZH2 proteolysis. Figure 4.

Two microliters of this reaction were resolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and immunoblotted with anti-GST antibody.

Knockdown of β-TrCP resulted in the accumulation of EZH2 as well as its H3K27me activity. In contrast, knockdown of EZH2 caused a significant loss of H3K27me, while knockdown of β-TrCP along with EZH2 partially rescued the levels of EZH2 as well as its H3K27me activity (Figures 4a and b). CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN2A/p16 are known downstream transcriptional targets of EZH2.14, 34, 35 To further validate functional consequences of EZH2 stabilization as a result of β-TrCP silencing, we examined if knockdown of β-TrCP-mediated accumulation of EZH2 repressed transcript levels of its downstream targets CDKN1A and CDKN2A. In keeping with our hypothesis and consistent with predictions from previous results, β-TrCP silencing resulted in protein accumulation of EZH2 as well as downregulation of transcript levels of CDKN1A and CDKN2A its known downstream targets (Figure 4c). No change in EZH2 transcript levels were observed with β-TrCP silencing. Top of page Discussion In the present study, we report that phosphorylation of EZH2 at Y641 residue by Jak2 promotes β-TrCP-mediated EZH2 degradation and consequent regulation of H3K27me. Generally, β-TrCP recognizes substrates phosphorylated at serine/threonine residues within the context of a canonical DSGxxS phosphodegron.29 In this report, we identify a novel tyrosine phosphorylation-based recognition of EZH2 by the β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase. Interestingly, the tyrosine required in EZH2 in order for it to be recognized by β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase happens to be the most recurrently mutated residue in GC-derived B-cell lymphomas and these mutations provide a gain of function to EZH2 methyl transferase activity.12, 14  EZH2, the catalytically active component of PRC2, di- and trimethylates Lys 27 of histone H3, a histone mark linked to gene silencing and tumor development. The enzymatic activity of EZH2 largely depends upon the formation of the PRC2 complex comprised of EZH2, EED and SUZ12.36 Variations in the levels of individual components of this complex could therefore affect the activity of the PRC2 holoenzyme. In fact, Pasini et al.7 report that loss of SUZ12 promotes EZH2 proteolysis and thus SUZ12 prevents the degradation of EZH2 and preserves enzymatic activity of EZH2-containing complexes.7 To better understand the contribution of modulation of rate limiting components in the PRC2 complex, we investigated the effects of potential post-translational regulation of PRC2 components. By inhibiting the proteasomal turnover of PRC2 core components in the absence of other two critical subunits of the complex, we observed that EZH2 undergoes quick proteolysis in the absence of a stable PRC2 complex. On the basis of the fact that the CRLs form the largest known class of multicomponent E3 ubiquitin ligase family in eukaryotes and target a wide array of substrates involved in several biological processes,22, 27 we sought to examine a role for CRL-mediated EZH2 regulation by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. To identify the CRL machinery that targets EZH2 for degradation, we screened the panel of cullin family E3 ligases for interaction with EZH2 and discovered that a cullin1-mediated process was involved in EZH2 proteolysis. Further studies demonstrated that phosphorylation of EZH2 at Y641 residue by Jak2 promotes β-TrCP-mediated EZH2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby controlling PRC2 complex-mediated H3K27me activity.  Somatic mutations targeting Y641 in GC-derived non-Hodgkin lymphoma12 confer a gain-of-function capacity to EZH2.14 We investigated whether these mutations resulted in increased stability of EZH2 protein. In this regard, all tested mutant cell lines endogenously harboring Y641 mutations showed delay in EZH2 protein turnover as compared with WT. Next, we investigated if this mutation affects EZH2 interaction with β-TrCP. Our results indicated that mutations in the Y641 residue of EZH2 abrogated its binding and consequent ubiquitination and degradation by β-TrCP. We further show that β-TrCP interaction with EZH2 is phosphorylation dependent and interestingly this phosphorylation event occurs on Y641 residue by Jak2 tyrosine kinase. To the best of our knowledge, such recognition mechanism has not been described in association with β-TrCP.  Our conclusion that EZH2 is a physiological substrate of β-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase is supported by several lines of evidence: first, we demonstrated that EZH2 interacts with cullin 1 exclusively among seven different cullin members tested. Secondly, endogenous EZH2 levels accumulate upon cullin1 silencing. Third, EZH2 binds to β-TrCP exclusively among eight different F-box proteins tested. Binding to β-TrCP requires an intact substrate-binding domain of the E3 ligase. In addition, the half-life of the EZH2 protein is prolonged by siRNA-mediated β-TrCP silencing. Correspondingly, expression of the dominant-negative mutant of β-TrCP significantly reduced EZH2 ubiquitination. Further, the interaction of β-TrCP with EZH2 is phosphorylation dependent and this phosphorylation is mediated on a tyrosine residue (Y641) by Jak2, and finally, the cellular levels of EZH2 and its methyl transferase activity can be controlled by modulation of β-TrCP levels.  In summary, we identify a previously undescribed Jak2–β-TrCP–EZH2 axis in the regulation of H3K27me. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that a recurrently mutated site in lymphoid cancer (Y641) is phosphorylated and this phosphorylation mediated by Jak2 tyrosine kinase is critical for interaction of βTrCP with EZH2 and that mutations at this site confer increased stability to the EZH2 protein with attendant hyperactive H3K27me activity (Figure 5d). We speculate that being in the PRC2 complex, EZH2 is protected from recognition by β-TrCP either by steric hindrance or masking of degron by other components of PRC2 complex.7, 37 It is possible that phosphorylation of degron site (Y641) by Jak2 might cause conformational changes in EZH2, leading to either disruption of the PRC2 holoenzyme complex and/or exposure of degron to be recognized by β-TrCP for consequent degdradation. This study opens up a potential new avenue to examine the changes in molecular architecture of PRC2 complex in order for it to be rearranged/degraded in specific cellular contexts. Recognition of this newly identified mechanism might help in design potential novel therapeutic approaches for clinical management of cancers driven by aberrant accumulation/function of EZH2.

(d) A model of regulation of EZH2 stability. We propose that Jak2-mediated EZH2 Y641 phosphorylation promotes its interaction with SCFβ-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase, which in turn initiates the polyubiquitination of EZH2. This sequence of events results in proteasomal degradation of EZH2.  Epigenetic alterations are important during carcinogenesis, and earlier studies suggested that global histone modification levels are predictive for patients’ outcome in various tumor entities.  We demonstrate that H3K27me1 and H3K27me3 are markers of progression-free survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma. OBJECTIVE  • To evaluate if histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation plays a role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissue and whether its expression is a predictor of cancer recurrence in RCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS  • A tissue microarray (TMA) with 193 RCC specimens (comprising 142 clear-cell, 31 papillary, 10 chromophobe and 10 sarcomatoid RCC), 10 oncocytoma tissue specimens and a TMA with 30 benign renal tissue samples were stained with antibodies against H3K27-monomethyl (H3K27me1), H3K27-dimethyl (H3K27me2) and H3K27-trimethyl (H3K27me3).  • Sections were scored according to staining intensity and the proportion of epithelial cells showing nuclear staining.  • H3K27 methylation levels were correlated with established clinical-pathological variables (tumour-node-metastasis [TNM] stage, Fuhrman grade) and progression-free/cancer-specific survival. RESULTS  • H3K27me1/-me2/-me3 staining was significantly more intense in papillary RCC then in clear-cell RCC.  • H3K27me3 levels were higher in oncocytoma than in RCC.  • H3K27me1/-me2/-me3 methylation levels were inversely correlated with Fuhrman grading and pT-stage.  • Global H3K27me1/-me2/-me3 methylation levels were always higher in benign renal tissue than in RCC with tumour relapse (H3K27me1 P < 0.001, H3K27me2 P= 0.032, H3K27me3 P= 0.004).  • Progression-free survival was shorter in patients with lower levels of H3K27me1 and H3K27me3 in the univariate analysis. The newly created H3K27me score (combining the staining levels of the single modifications) was a significant and independent predictor of RCC progression-free survival. CONCLUSION  • The present study on H3K27-methylation supports the hypothesis that global histone modifications are potential markers of cancer prognosis in RCC. One reason could be that decreased H3K27 indicates transcriptional activation and therefore predicts cancer activation.

INTRODUCTION  The incidence and mortality rates of RCC have increased in recent years with 57 760 new cases and 12 980 deaths in 2009 [1]. The clinical outcomes of patients with RCC depend mainly on TNM stage, Fuhrman grade and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status [2], however, patients with RCC with similar tumour characteristics still show heterogeneity in their outcome. Approximately 50% of patients with RCC develop metastases and have a very poor survival rate (<5–15%) [1]. This emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of RCC, which would lead to better tools to predict the outcome of the disease.  DNA methylation and histone modifications are major epigenetic mechanisms involved in gene regulation and are frequently altered in carcinogenesis [3]. Previous research in RCC epigenetics has focused on DNA methylation and it has been shown that cancer cell DNA is generally hypomethylated [4]. Hypermethylation of the CpG island of a tumour suppressor gene has been identified as an important step in renal cell carcinogenesis [5] but, so far, histone modifications have been less comprehensively studied despite the fact that changes in DNA methylation are closely related to histone alterations.  A variety of post-translational modifications occur on the N-terminal tail of histones. These modifications include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, ADP-ribosylation and deimination [6]. The modifications function either by disrupting chromatin contacts or by affecting the recruitment of various proteins to the chromatin and thereby regulating transcription. For example, histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) monomethyl (H3K27me1), histone H3- (H3Ac) and histone H4 lysine acetylation (H4Ac) have been linked with transcriptional activity, whereas histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9), H3K2727 dimethyl (H3K27me2), H3K27 trimethyl (H3K27me3) and histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) have been linked with transcriptional repression. In addition, histone lysine methylation can be found in the form of mono- (me1), di- (me2), and trimethylation (me3), and an increasing number of methylation marks may intensify its activating or repressive character [6,7]. These modifications are dynamic and multiple enzymes that add or remove methylation marks have been identified [8].  Histone modifications can also be assessed using immunohistochemistry at the whole nuclei level of cancer cells; it was first shown by Seligson et al. [9] that global levels of both H3K4me2 and histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation (H3K18Ac) are predictors of biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer. Accumulation of H3K4me1 also predicts PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy [10]. Later, prognostic relevance of global histone modification levels was also reported for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, who have a better survival with high H3K4me2 or low H3K9Ac levels [11]. Global H3K9Ac levels were used to identify patients with low grade bladder cancer with disease recurrence after transurethral resection of the bladder [12]. Some histone modifications have also been analysed in RCC: H3K4me2 and H3K18Ac were independent predictors of RCC mortality [13]. Lower global levels of total H3Ac [14] and H3K9Ac [15], respectively, were reported in RCC patients with a high Fuhrman grade. Progression-free survival and cancer-specific survival periods were shorter in patients with low levels of H3K4 [16].  So far, global H3K27 methylation levels have not been systematically investigated in RCC. To clarify whether these modifications have a potential diagnostic and prognostic role, we performed immunohistochemistry to assess H3K27 mono, di- and tri-methylation levels in a tissue microarray (TMA) with 193 RCC specimens. We then correlated global H3K27 modification levels with clinical-pathological variables and patient outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS  PATIENTS AND TMAS  The present study comprised 193 patients with RCC who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy. Surgery was performed at the Departments of Urology at the Universitätsklinikum Bonn, Germany and the Waldkrankenhaus Bonn, Germany between 1994 and 2008. All samples were randomly chosen from our tissue bank. Follow-up information was available for 117 patients. Disease progression was present in 36 patients and 16 died from RCC. We created a TMA with 30 cores from benign renal tissue. This tissue was sampled from the healthy part of tumour nephrectomy kidneys. The mean follow-up time was 66 months (median 51 months).  All patients were re-evaluated by a panel of uropathologists to determine the histological subtype, histopathological stage and Fuhrman grade. The RCC tissue comprised clear-cell RCC (ccRCC; n= 142), papillary RCC (pRCC; n= 31), chromophobe RCC (chRCC, n= 10) and sarcomatoid RCC (sRCC, n= 10). The pRCC samples were also classified into the subgroups pRCC type 1 (n= 18) and pRCC type 2 (n= 13). In addition, 10 oncocytoma samples were used. The TMA was prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens using a manual device (Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). Three tissue cores were arrayed to obtain a representative image of the tumour. The study was approved by the local ethics board. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY  Paraffin sections (5 µm) were cut from the TMA block and used within 1 week. Deparaffinization was done using xylene and the sections were rehydrated with graded ethanol. Slides were placed in target retrieval solution (citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and heated for 10 min at boiling temperature (microwave, 600 W). After cooling for 15 min, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by treatment with 3% H2O2 for 10 min. The sections were washed with tris-buffered saline. After a 15-min protein block with normal swine serum, the primary antibodies H3K27me1 (dilution: 1:1000; Lot ♯ JBC1395546, Catalogue ♯ 07-448, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), H3K27me2 (dilution: 1:200; Lot ♯ 32530, Catalogue ♯ 07-452, Millipore) and H3K27me3 (dilution: 1:200; Lot ♯ DAM1421462, Catalogue ♯ 07-449, Millipore) were applied overnight at 4 °C. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the labelled-streptavidine-biotin-peroxidase complex technique (LSAB, DAKO Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The biotin-conjugated secondary antibody was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, as was the avidin biotin enzyme reagent. The peroxidase was developed with the AEC system (DAKO Cytomation). The sections were counterstained with haematoxylin and mounted (Fig. 1).  Figure 1.  Figure 1.  Open in figure viewer Immunohistochemical staining of A, H3K27me1; B, H3K27me2; C, H3K27me3 in ccRCC. Original magnification ×400. Immunostaining results were evaluated using the Remmele scoring system [17]. The number of positive epithelial cells was estimated per core and scaled (0, no positive cells; 1, 1–25% positive cells; 2, 26–50% positive cells; 3, 51–75% positive cells; and 4, 76–100% positive cells). These scores were multiplied with an intensity scale (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, intensive staining). Three cores were evaluated in each patient. Evaluation of immunohistochemical staining was performed without knowledge of the clinical-pathological variables. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  Clinical-pathological variables were correlated with the global H3K27 methylation levels using the Spearman–Rho test, the Mann–Whitney U-test and the Kruskal–Wallis test, as appropriate. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to correlate the period of progression-free survival and cancer-specific survival after surgery with H3K27 methylation levels/clinical-pathological variables. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences program (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA); a P value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS  DISTRIBUTION OF H3K27 METHYLATION LEVELS IN HISTOLOGICAL RCC SUBTYPES AND NORMAL RENAL TISSUE  First, we analysed the distribution of H3K27 methylation levels among the histological subtypes (Table 1): H3K27me1 levels were mostly low throughout all histological subtypes; only the pRCC samples had slightly higher staining scores and this difference was significant (ccRCC vs pRCC: P= 0.011, Mann–Whitney U-test). H3K27me2 levels were unevenly distributed in the histological subtypes: pRCC samples frequently displayed higher H3K27me2 levels, whereas the other subtypes predominantly showed weak or moderate staining. These differences were significant (ccRCC vs pRCC: P < 0.001; pRCC vs chRCC: P= 0.003; pRCC vs sRCC: P < 0.001). H3K27me3 levels were generally high in all subtypes, but ccRCC samples showed somewhat lower levels (ccRCC vs pRCC: P= 0.018; ccRCC vs chRCC: P= 0.012). For the pRCC subtypes, no differences could be found for H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3. Global H3K27me1/-me2 methylation levels were mostly similar in oncocytoma and RCC, but H3K27me3 levels were significantly higher in oncocytoma than in RCC (P= 0.027). Global H3K27me1/-me2/-me3 methylation levels were always higher in benign renal tissue than in RCC with tumour relapse (H3K27me1: P < 0.001; H3K27me2: P= 0.032; H3K27me3: P= 0.004). No significant association could be seen when comparing benign renal tissue with RCC without tumour relapse (H3K27me1: P= 0.135; H3K27me2: P= 0.337; H3K27me3: P= 0.577; Fig. 2). We also compared H3K27methylation with H3K4me and histone acetylation, which was reported in an earlier study [16,18]. All H3K27 methylation marks were significantly associated with H3K4me1, H4K4me2, H3K4me3, H4Ac, H3Ac, H3K9Ac, H3K18Ac (all P < 0.001, Spearman–Rho test; Table 2[16,18])  Table 1.

We observed that adverse clinical-pathological parameters were associated with lower levels of H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3. Patients with higher pathological T-stage had decreasing levels of H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 (pT1a > pT1b > pT2 > pT3/4; all P < 0.001). An increasing Fuhrman grade (grade 1 > grade 2 > grade 3/4; all P≤ 0.005) was associated with lower levels of H3K27me1, H2k27me2 and H3K27me3. The decreasing levels of global H3K27 methylation were associated with vasculary invasion (all P≤ 0.001) or with the presence of distant metastasis (H3K27me3; P= 0.007). Lymph node metastasis was not associated with H3K27 methylation (P= 0.15–0.53). H3K27 methylation was not associated with gender (P= 0.057–0.788) or age (P= 0.405–589; Spearman–Rho test; Table 3).

The analyses showed that low levels of H3K27me1 (P= 0.021) and H3K27me3 (P= 0.012) were significant predictors of progression-free survival in the univariate model; however, H3K27 methylation levels failed to reach significance (P < 0.05) in the multivariate model, which also included TNM staging and the Fuhrman grade. H3K27me1 also significantly predicted cancer-specific survival in the univariate (P= 0.047, Fig. 3) but not in the multivariate model (P= 0.142).  Figure 3.  Figure 3.  Open in figure viewer Kaplan–Meier estimates for global H3K27 methylation: low global levels on H3K27me1 and H2K27me3 are significant predictors of progression-free survival as shown in Kaplan Meier estimates. Low global levels on H3K27me1 is a significant predictor for cancer specific survival. To evaluate the impact of all three methylation marks, we determined the H3K27me score: since Remmele scores [17] were unevenly distributed in H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3, a simple addition of the scores would not be useful. We therefore decided to calculate a threshold that distinguished patients with and without RCC progression most accurately using receiver–operator characteristic analysis (H3K27me1 ≤ 1; H3K27me2 ≤ 11; H3K27me3 ≤ 5). A Remmele score below the threshold was scored with 1, and the sum of all three modifications was termed the H3K27me score. This score was significantly associated with progression-free survival (P= 0.001) and cancer-specific mortality (P= 0.004) in the univariate model (Fig. 3). In the multivariate model, which included TNM staging and the Fuhrman grade, significance was also reached for the prediction of progression-free survival (P= 0.032). As expected, the established parameters of TNM-staging and Fuhrman grading significantly predicted progression-free survival and cancer-specific mortality (P < 0.001, Cox regression analysis). DISCUSSION  Epigenetic alterations play an important role in carcinogenesis. Knowledge of histone modifications as established regulators in the transcriptional regulation has emerged in the last few years: in general, histone lysine acetylation is associated with transcriptional activity. By contrast, the effect of histone lysine methylation is more complex. Current thinking is that transcriptional activation or repression depends on the specific position of histone methylation. The degree of activation or repression is further influenced by the number of methylation residues [6]. Previous studies focused mostly on histone acetylation, and did not systematically explore the role of H3K27 methylation. We therefore examined the global level of H3K27 mono-, di- and trimethylation in patients with RCC.  We showed that differential histone methylation (H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H2K27me3) was associated with clinical-pathological variables. Advanced pT-stage, increased Fuhrman-grade and vascular invasion were associated with decreasing levels of H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 methylation. Patients with distant metastases had significantly lower H3K27me3 levels. Global H3K27me1/-me2/-me3 methylation levels were always higher in benign renal tissue than in RCC with tumour relapse, which supports our hypothesis that H3K27 indicates transcriptional activation and therefore predicts cancer activation.  Low levels of H3K27 methylation were also predictive of a shorter period of progression-free survival (H3K27me1 and H3K27me3) and cancer-specific survival (H3K27me1) in the univariate model. However, the H3K27 methylation levels failed to reach significance in the multivariate model which included TNM staging and the Fuhrman grade. In contrast, the H3K27me score, which combined the different degrees of methylation at lysine 27, was an independent and significant predictor of recurrence-free survival. The higher predictive value of the ‘global’ H3K27me score in RCC could be attributable to a better representation of cumulating epigenetic alterations during cancer progression. It should be noted that the statistical power for a multivariate analysis with up to six variables in a cohort of 117 patients is limited, and future validation of our findings in a larger data set is necessary.  The concept that histone modifications are a prognostic marker is supported by several other studies: low levels of H3K4me2 and H3K18Ac have been shown to be predictive of cancer-specific survival in patients with localized RCC [13]. It should be noted that, in this latter study, in a multivariate Cox-model that included grade, Ki-67 and p53 expression, the histone modifications remained a significant predictor of cancer-specific survival, which was no longer the case when ECOG performance status was included [13]. The smaller series published by Minardi et al. [15] and Kanao et al. [14] showed lower levels of H3Ac and H3K9Ac in poorly differentiated RCC specimens.  We have previously also studied histone H3K4 methylation and H3/H4/H3K9/H3K18-acetylation in patients with RCC [16,18]. The staining scores for histone methylation and acetylation were significantly associated with each other. The association of histone modification with acetylation suggests possible epigenetic confusion in RCC cells, resulting from aberrant activity and/or expression of histone-modifying enzymes.  Our results indicate an excess of H3K27 demethylases compared with methylases resulting in lower H3K27 methylation levels in RCC and an unfavourable clinical course. So far, only one H3K27 methylase (EZH2) and two H3K27 demethylases (JMJD3 and UTX) have been identified in the human. EZH2 was shown to be overexpressed in RCC [19], whereas the expression of JMJD3 and UTX remains unstudied. However, recent studies indicate a role for the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway in the regulation of histone modifications. Accumulation of HIF1α is common in RCC, and associated with poor prognosis [20]. Many jumonji-domain histone demethylases harbour a HIF1α -binding site, and JMJD3 and UTX are both activated by HIF1α in a hypoxic environment [21]. It was shown for the HIF1α-regulated H3K9 demethylase JMJD1A that it acts as a signal amplifier to facilitate hypoxic gene expression and finally enhances tumour growth [22]. It should also be considered that the list of human H3K27 methylases/demethylases is likely to be lengthened in the future. For example, novel H3K27me1-demethylases (ATXR5, ATXR6) have been recently discovered in Arabidopsis thaliana[23]. Histone modifications are dynamic and could be targets for future medical therapy. Our data showed that methylation levels of H3K27me3 are higher than H3K27me2. We also found, that the methylation levels of H3K27me1 are lower than H3K27me2. These data support the hypothesis that more histone lysine methylases than demethylases are to be found in RCC. Earlier studies have shown that reduced global levels of histone modifications (H4K20me3 in leukaemia cells [24]) were mainly attributable to loss at repetitive DNA sequences (e.g. subtelomeric repetitive element D4Z4; acromcentric chromosomal region NBL2, juxtacentromeric satellite element Sat2), and not to loss in specific tumour suppressor genes or oncogenes; DNA hypomethylation in repetitive regions contributes to chromosomal instability [25]. We assume that loss of histone methylation may also cause genomic instability.  We also investigated the distribution of H3K27 methylation levels in tumours with different histological subtypes. As expected, there were few papillary, chromophobe or sarcomatoid differentiation patterns as a consequence of their low incidence. For these low numbers (pRCC n= 31, chRCC n= 10, sRCC n= 10) it is difficult to perform powerful statistical analyses. Nevertheless we found significant lower levels of H3K27methylation levels in ccRCC than in pRCC. Also, global H3K27me3 methylation levels in oncocytoma were significantly higher than in RCC. Previously Kanao et al. [14] reported in a small study that H3K9Ac levels were lower in RCC than in non-malignant adjacent tissue. He also suggested that ccRCC patients have lower levels of H3K9Ac than do pRCC patients, but a very low number of cases made significant conclusions impossible.  To investigate whether alterations in histone modifications occur in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we measured histone H3/ H4 acetylation and H3K4/H3K27 methylation levels, as well as the expression of chromatin modifier genes in tumor and healthy esophageal tissue from ESCC patients. We found evidence of global H3 and H4 hypoacetylation, H3K4 and H3K27 hypermethylation in ESCC tissue. Both H3 hypoacetylation and H3K27 hypermethylation correlated with the severity and histological differentiation of the tumor, and H3K4 hypermethylation also correlated with tumor differentiation. Our results suggest that aberrant histone modifications may play an important role in the development and progression of ESCC.  Keywords: : Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, Histone, Acetylation, Methylation, Post-translational modification INTRODUCTION  Esophageal carcinoma is the eighth most common cancer in the world, and survival rates are low (1 Kamangar F, Dores GM, Anderson WF. Patterns of cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence across five continents: defining priorities to reduce cancer disparities in different geographic regions of the world. J Clin Oncol 2006;24(14):2137–2150. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). On the basis of etiological and pathological characteristics, esophageal carcinomas can be separated into two main types, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) (2 Enzinger PC, Mayer RJ. Esophageal cancer. N Engl J Med 2003;349(23):2241–2252. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). While the incidence of EAC is on the rise in Western countries, ESCC remains the predominant form of esophageal cancer in Asia (3 Pohl H, Welch HG. The role of overdiagnosis and reclassification in the marked increase of esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence. J Natl Cancer Inst 2005;97(2):142–146. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Approximately three quarters of all EACs are found in the distal esophagus, whereas ESCCs are more evenly distributed throughout the middle and lower third of the esophagus (2 Enzinger PC, Mayer RJ. Esophageal cancer. N Engl J Med 2003;349(23):2241–2252. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] , 4 Siewert JR, Stein HJ, Feith M, Bruecher BL, Bartels H, Fink U. Histologic tumor type is an independent prognostic parameter in esophageal cancer: lessons from more than 1,000 consecutive resections at a single center in the Western world. Ann Surg 2001;234(3):360–367; discussion 368–369. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). The development of these tumors is strongly associated with a number of dietary and environmental factors, such as alcohol consumption, smoking, and high level of nitrates in the soil and drinking water (5 Morita M, Kuwano H, Ohno S, Sugimachi K, Seo Y, Tomoda H, Furusawa M, Nakashima T. Multiple occurrence of carcinoma in the upper aerodigestive tract associated with esophageal cancer: reference to smoking, drinking and family history. Int J Cancer 1994;58(2):207–210. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Although surgical removal of the tumor is currently the most commonly employed treatment option for patients with esophageal carcinoma, the success of surgery depends strongly on early diagnosis and current screening methods. The principal screen for these types of cancers is the TNM staging system that scores tumors on the basis of radiological and clinical features. The utility of this screen is limited, however, by high cost and poor detection sensitivity for early stage esophageal carcinomas (6 Tomizawa Y, Wang KK. Screening, surveillance, and prevention for esophageal cancer. Gastroenterol Clin North Am 2009;38(1):59–73, viii. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Thus, the development of alternative screening methods, including those that test for genetic and epigenetic markers of the disease, would improve the clinical management of esophageal carcinomas and improve patient outcomes.  Multiple studies have demonstrated that specific epigenetic alterations are important features of cancer development. For example, a growing body of evidence indicates that aberrant DNA methylation is involved in the tumorigenesis of lung (7, 8 Paliwal A, Vaissiere T, Krais A, Cuenin C, Cros MP, Zaridze D, Moukeria A, Boffetta P, Hainaut P, Brennan P, Herceg Z. Aberrant DNA methylation links cancer susceptibility locus 15q25.1 to apoptotic regulation and lung cancer. Cancer Res 2010;70(7):2779–2788.

Oncogene 2010;29(43):5828–5838.   ), esophagus (9, 10 Vasavi M, Ponnala S, Gujjari K, Boddu P, Bharatula RS, Prasad R, Ahuja YR, Hasan Q. DNA methylation in esophageal diseases including cancer: special reference to hMLH1 gene promoter status. Tumori 2006;92(2):155–162. Long C, Yin B, Lu Q, Zhou X, Hu J, Yang Y, Yu F, Yuan Y. Promoter hypermethylation of the RUNX3 gene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer Invest 2007;25(8):685–690.   ), thymic epithelium (11 Chen C, Yin B, Wei Q, Li D, Hu J, Yu F, Lu Q. Aberrant DNA methylation in thymic epithelial tumors. Cancer Invest 2009;27(5):582–591. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ) and other tissues (12 Kulis M, Esteller M. DNA methylation and cancer. Adv Genet 2010;70:27–56. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). In addition, modifications to histones at N-terminal histone tails that protrude from the nucleosomes are recognized as genomic markers of genes undergoing epigenetic deregulation in disease. At least eight histone modifications have been identified, among which acetylation and methylation are the most commonly studied. Histone acetylation and methylation are both reversible events that can either disrupt chromosomal contacts or affect nonhistone protein interactions with chromatin, thus altering chromatin structure and rates of transcription (13 Vialou V. Histone acetylation, gene regulation and depression. Med Sci (Paris) 2010;26(5):465–467. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylase (HDACs) acetylate and deacetylate lysine residues of histone proteins, and thereby regulate the access of many transcriptional factors to DNA and consequently enhance or inhibit gene expression. Evidence suggests that the overall acetylation state of histone proteins correlates with transcriptional activity, with hypoacetylation states suppressing transcription and hyperacetylation states conferring increased transcriptional activity (14 Schubeler D, Lorincz MC, Cimbora DM, Telling A, Feng YQ, Bouhassira EE, Groudine M. Genomic targeting of methylated DNA: influence of methylation on transcription, replication, chromatin structure, and histone acetylation. Mol Cell Biol 2000;20(24):9103–9112. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ).  Table 1  Characteristics of 30 Patients with ESCC   CSVDisplay Table Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and demethylases are enzymes that catalyze the addition and removal of histones methyl groups (15 Peterson CL, Laniel MA. Histones and histone modifications. Curr Biol 2004;14(14):R546–R551. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Lysine residues in histone H3 can be mono, di, or trimethylated. Previous studies demonstrate that methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) and H3K27 is associated with transcriptional repression, whereas methylation at H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79 is associated with transcriptional activation (15 Peterson CL, Laniel MA. Histones and histone modifications. Curr Biol 2004;14(14):R546–R551. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Furthermore, H3K4 methylation is associated with euchromatin function, and H3K27 methylation is involved in X-chromosome inactivation (16 Plath K, Fang J, Mlynarczyk-Evans SK, Cao R, Worringer KA, Wang H, de la Cruz CC, Otte AP, Panning B, Zhang Y. Role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in X inactivation. Science 2003;300(5616):131–135. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ).  In esophageal carcinoma, hypermethylation of histone H4 has been observed in the early stage of tumor development and this change correlates with aberrant expression of HDAC1, indicating that abnormal histone modifications play important roles in the development of the disease (17 Toh Y, Yamamoto M, Endo K, Ikeda Y, Baba H, Kohnoe S, Yonemasu H, Hachitanda Y, Okamura T, Sugimachi K. Histone H4 acetylation and histone deacetylase 1 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Oncol Rep 2003;10(2):333–338. [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). However, the regulation of histone modifications and chromatin modifier genes in ESCC has not been thoroughly studied. In this study, we investigated global methylation and acetylation patterns on histone H3 and H4, as well as the expression of 16 members of three classes of chromatin modifier genes in ESCC and healthy esophageal tissue. Among these parameters, we found a number significant alterations and uncovered corelationships between specific changes in epigenetic factors and chromatin modifier gene expression.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Tissue samples  Fresh frozen ESCC samples and paired control esophageal tissue samples (healthy surrounding esophageal tissue more than 5 cm away from tumor) were obtained from 30 ESCC patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China. The 18 male and 12 female patients ranged between 50 and 71 years of age (mean 58.8 ± 5.59 years) and all had undergone ESCC surgery between May and November 2009. None of the patients had received preoperative treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Control samples were histologically confirmed as healthy esophageal tissues, while all tumor samples were histologically and pathologically confirmed as ESCC, and staged according to the TNM system (18 Thompson SK, Ruszkiewicz AR, Jamieson GG, Esterman A, Watson DI, Wijnhoven BP, Lamb PJ, Devitt PG. Improving the accuracy of TNM staging in esophageal cancer: a pathological review of resected specimens. Ann Surg Oncol 2008;15(12):3447–3458. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Only samples with a tumor cell content of more than 80% were included in this study. A summary of clinical and pathological characteristics of patients included in this study is presented in Table 1. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the second Xiangya Hospital.  RNA isolation and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR)  Total RNA was isolated from primary ESCC tissue using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) and stored at −80°C. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the One Step SYBR® PrimeScriptTM RT-PCR Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Dalian, China) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer.

PowerPoint slideOriginal jpg (109.00KB)Display full size Detection of histone acetylation and methylation levels  Histone extraction and measurement of global histone H3/H4 acetylation, as well as global H3K4 and H3K27 methylation levels were performed using the EpiQuikTM global histone H3/H4 acetylation, and H3K4/H3K27 methylation assay kits, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Epigentek Group Inc., NY, USA). Briefly, histone proteins were stably spotted on strip wells. Acetylated histone H3/H4 and methylated histone H3K4/H3K27 levels were detected with highaffinity antibodies. Signals were developed using a horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies and quantified by measuring absorbance at 450 nm. Histone protein concentrations were measured with the BCATM Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).  Statistical analysis  Data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) and are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Student's t-test was used to compare continuous variables and Pearson's correlation test was used for correlation analyses. p values of less than .05 were considered significant.  RESULTS  Histone acetylation and methylation levels were measured in 30-paired samples of tumor and healthy esophageal tissue from patients with ESCC. We found that global histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels were reduced in tumor tissue compared with healthy control tissue [H3: p = .031; H4: p = .042; Figure 1(a)], whereas levels of methylated H3K4 and H3K27 were increased in tumor tissue compared with control tissue [H3K4: p = .001; H3K27: p = .002; Figure 1(b)]. The degree of both H3 hypoacetylation and H3K27 hypermethylation correlated with the severity of the tumor, as measured by TNM staging [H3 acetylation: p < .001; H3K27 methylation: p = .019; Figure 1(c)]. Furthermore, the degree of H3 hypoacetylation as well as H3K4 and H3K27 hypermethylation correlated with the histological differentiation of the tumor [H3 acetylation: p < .01; H3K4 methylation: p < .05; H3K27 methylation: p < .05; Figure 1(d)]. Correlations between global histone acetylation/methylation levels and clinicopathological characteristics were also evaluated [Table 3(a)]. H4 hypoacetylation was found to correlate with a history of alcohol consumption (p = .015), whereas H3 hypoacetylation was found to correlate with lymphatic permeation (p = .005).  Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the expression of sixteen members of chromatin modifier genes. Using β-actin as an internal control to normalize for differences in the amount of total RNA present in each sample, the levels of HDAC1 (p = .004), HDAC2 (p = .001), HDAC5 (p = .001), SIRT1 (p = .015), SUV39H1 (p < .001), and EZH2 (p = .005) mRNA transcripts were found to be significantly increased in ESCC tumor tissue compared with control tissue. In contrast, LSD1 mRNA was significantly decreased in tumor tissue (p = .007; Figure 2).  Table 3(a)  (a).

In addition, we found that the level of HDAC2 and H3 acetylation were inversely related(r = −0.539; p = .002), as were HDAC5 and H4 acetylation levels were detected [r = −0.383, p = .036; Figures 3(a) and (b)]. EZH2 mRNA levels positively correlated with H3K27 methylation level [r = 0.844, p < .001; Figure 3(c)]. We also found a positive correlation between HDAC2 expression and lymphatic permeation (p = .023). The expression levels of the chromatin modifier genes assayed did not appear to correlate with gender, tumor size, history of alcohol consumption, family history of esophageal carcinoma or lymphatic involvement [Table 3(b)].  Table 3(b)  (b). Correlation of Histone Modification and Chromatin Modifier Genes Expression Patterns with Clinicopathological Characteristics of Patients with ESCC.   CSVDisplay Table DISCUSSION  Posttranslational histone modifications to histones have received much attention for their ability to alter the physical state of chromatin and regulate gene expression (13 Vialou V. Histone acetylation, gene regulation and depression. Med Sci (Paris) 2010;26(5):465–467. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Furthermore, many of and the chromatin modifier genes that mediate these modifications have been associated with the development of cancer (19 Esteller M. Cancer epigenomics: DNA methylomes and histone-modification maps. Nat Rev Genet 2007;8(4):286–298. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). For example, recent reports analyzing global patterns of histone modifications suggest that H3K27 methylation is involved in the progression of prostate, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and nonsmall cell lung cancers, and could potentially serve as a prognostic factor for some or all of these diseases (20–22 Seligson DB, Horvath S, Shi T, Yu H, Tze S, Grunstein M, Kurdistani SK. Global histone modification patterns predict risk of prostate cancer recurrence. Nature 2005;435(7046):1262–1266. Barlesi F, Giaccone G, Gallegos-Ruiz MI, Loundou A, Span SW, Lefesvre P, Kruyt FA, Rodriguez JA. Global histone modifications predict prognosis of resected non small-cell lung cancer. J Clin Oncol 2007;25(28):4358–4364. Martinez-Garcia E, Licht JD. Deregulation of H3K27 methylation in cancer. Nat Genet 2010;42(2):100–101.   ). H3K27 hypermethylation is also a determinant of the aggressiveness of cancer cells because it is associated with the repression of several tumor suppressor genes (22 Martinez-Garcia E, Licht JD. Deregulation of H3K27 methylation in cancer. Nat Genet 2010;42(2):100–101. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). It is generally recognized that the methylation of H3K27 leads to the recruitment of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes to nucleosomes of the nascent DNA strand, resulting in gene silencing (23–25 Hansen KH, Bracken AP, Pasini D, Dietrich N, Gehani SS, Monrad A, Rappsilber J, Lerdrup M, Helin K. A model for transmission of the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark. Nat Cell Biol 2008;10(11):1291–1300. Cao R, Wang H, He J, Erdjument-Bromage H, Tempst P, Zhang Y. Role of hPHF1 in H3K27 methylation and Hox gene silencing. Mol Cell Biol 2008;28(5):1862–1872. He LR, Liu MZ, Li BK, Rao HL, Liao YJ, Guan XY, Zeng YX, Xie D. Prognostic impact of H3K27me3 expression on locoregional progression after chemoradiotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. BMC Cancer 2009;9:461.   ). In this study, we observed elevated levels of H3K27 methylation in ESCC tissue compared with healthy esophageal tissue from the same individual. Further analysis revealed that H3K27 hypermethylation was closely associated with the histological differentiation and the tumor stage.  H3K27 methylation is catalyzed by the polycomb proteins, a group of genes that have been characterized as oncogenes and are frequently overexpressed in cancers. Their oncogenic potential is mainly mediated through H3K27 methylation and the resulting epigenetic inactivation of the INK4A-ARF pathway, which mainly encodes tumor suppressor genes such as p16/INK4A and p14/ARF, which are key regulators of cellular senescence (26 Chen H, Gu X, Su IH, Bottino R, Contreras JL, Tarakhovsky A, Kim SK. Polycomb protein Ezh2 regulates pancreatic beta-cell Ink4a/Arf expression and regeneration in diabetes mellitus. Genes Dev 2009;23(8):975–985. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). EZH2 (enhancer of Zeste homolog 2) is a polycomb group protein overexpressed in many cancer types, including breast, prostate and esophagus (27 Simon JA, Lange CA. Roles of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase in cancer epigenetics. Mutat Res 2008;647(1–2):21–29. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). In ESCCs, EZH2 expression and global hypermethylation of histone H3K27 are correlated with tumor stage and locoregional progression (25 He LR, Liu MZ, Li BK, Rao HL, Liao YJ, Guan XY, Zeng YX, Xie D. Prognostic impact of H3K27me3 expression on locoregional progression after chemoradiotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. BMC Cancer 2009;9:461. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Google Scholar] ). Our results confirm the relationship between EZH2 overexpression and H3K27 methylation levels in ESCC tissue, in a manner consistent with the observations published by Tzao and colleagues. (28 Tzao C, Tung HJ, Jin JS, Sun GH, Hsu HS, Chen BH, Yu CP, Lee SC. Prognostic significance of global histone modifications in resected squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Mod Pathol 2009;22(2):252–260. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). These findings indicate that the hypermethylation of H3K27 may promote the development and progression of ESCC.  Histones with trimethylated H3K4 are often clustered around transcriptional start sites, whereas histones with dimethylated H3K4 tend to be present throughout the coding region of transcribed genes (29, 30 Lee MG, Norman J, Shilatifard A, Shiekhattar R. Physical and functional association of a trimethyl H3K4 demethylase and Ring6a/MBLR, a polycomb-like protein. Cell 2007;128(5):877–887. Yamane K, Tateishi K, Klose RJ, Fang J, Fabrizio LA, Erdjument-Bromage H, Taylor-Papadimitriou J, Tempst P, Zhang Y. PLU-1 is an H3K4 demethylase involved in transcriptional repression and breast cancer cell proliferation. Mol Cell 2007;25(6):801–812.   ). Recent research showed that methylated H3K4 is expressed at varying frequencies in different carcinomas. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and stomach and neuroendocrine carcinomas, methylated H3K4 was frequently and highly expressed, whereas in hepatocellular carcinomas, it is less abundant. One reason for these distinct different levels of H3K4 methylation in different carcinomas could be the differential expression of opposing histone modification enzyme pairs, such as histone methylases and demethylases (31 Magerl C, Ellinger J, Braunschweig T, Kremmer E, Koch LK, Holler T, Buttner R, Luscher B, Gutgemann I. H3K4 dimethylation in hepatocellular carcinoma is rare compared with other hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal carcinomas and correlates with expression of the methylase Ash2 and the demethylase LSD1. Hum Pathol 2010;41(2):181–189. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). LSD1, one of the histone demethylases, is highly specic for mono and dimethylated H3K4 and functions as a transcriptional corepressor by removing methyl groups from the transcriptional activity-related H3K4 residue (32 Shi Y, Lan F, Matson C, Mulligan P, Whetstine JR, Cole PA, Casero RA. Histone demethylation mediated by the nuclear amine oxidase homolog LSD1. Cell 2004;119(7):941–953. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Transcriptional target analysis revealed that LSD1 regulates several cellular signaling pathways including TGFbeta1 signaling pathway that are critically involved in cell proliferation and survival, including TGF-β1 signaling. Wang and colleagues observed downregulation of LSD1 in breast carcinomas, and they also observed that the expression of LSD1 could inhibit the invasion of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo (33 Wang Y, Zhang H, Chen Y, Sun Y, Yang F, Yu W, Liang J, Sun L, Yang X, Shi L, Li R, Li Y, Zhang Y, Li Q, Yi X, Shang Y. LSD1 is a subunit of the NuRD complex and targets the metastasis programs in breast cancer. Cell 2009;138(4):660–672. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). In the current study, we observed a global increase in H3K4 methylation levels in ESCC tissue samples, as well as a positive relationship between levels of H3K4 methylation and tumor severity. Downregulation of LSD1 was also observed in ESCC tissues, indicating that H3K4 methylation may play an important role in the development of ESCC.  In this study, we report that histone H3 and H4 were hypoacetylated in ESCC tissue samples compared with healthy esophageal tissue from the same patient. In addition, we found that H3 hypoacetylation correlated with tumor stage and differentiation, suggesting that this epigenetic phenomenon is related to ESCC aggressiveness. ESCC has been linked to a number of environmental factors, including alcoholism. Interestingly, we found that hypoacetylation of histone H4 was more prevalent in patients with a history of alcohol consumption.  It has previously been demonstrated that levels of H4 acetylation and the aberrant expression of HDAC1 are frequently associated with ESCC (17 Toh Y, Yamamoto M, Endo K, Ikeda Y, Baba H, Kohnoe S, Yonemasu H, Hachitanda Y, Okamura T, Sugimachi K. Histone H4 acetylation and histone deacetylase 1 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Oncol Rep 2003;10(2):333–338. [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] , 34 Tzao C, Sun GH, Tung HJ, Hsu HS, Hsu WH, Wang YC, Cheng YL, Lee SC. Reduced acetylated histone H4 is associated with promoter methylation of the fragile histidine triad gene in resected esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Ann Thorac Surg 2006;82(2):396–401; discussion 401. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Interestingly, HDAC1 expression is decreased in esophageal carcinoma cells relative to healthy mucosa tissue, but is significantly increased in carcinoma cells that have invaded into the deeper layers of the esophagus wall. Furthermore, H4 histones are highly hyperacetylated in esophageal carcinoma cells during the early stages of cancer invasion. These results suggest that epigenetic changes to H4 acetylation levels are dynamic and are determinant of esophageal cancer development and progression. Furthermore, hyperacetylation of histone H4 and overexpression of HDAC1 have been detected together in single tumors, implying that a functional interaction may exist between these two processes (17 Toh Y, Yamamoto M, Endo K, Ikeda Y, Baba H, Kohnoe S, Yonemasu H, Hachitanda Y, Okamura T, Sugimachi K. Histone H4 acetylation and histone deacetylase 1 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Oncol Rep 2003;10(2):333–338. [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ).  It is recognized that HDAC activity is critical for the deacetylation of histone and nonhistone proteins, and HDACs are important regulators of gene expression patterns and cell proliferation associated with malignant transformation (35, 36 Minucci S, Pelicci PG. Histone deacetylase inhibitors and the promise of epigenetic (and more) treatments for cancer. Nat Rev Cancer 2006;6(1):38–51. Park JH, Jung Y, Kim TY, Kim SG, Jong HS, Lee JW, Kim DK, Lee JS, Kim NK, Bang YJ. Class I histone deacetylase-selective novel synthetic inhibitors potently inhibit human tumor proliferation. Clin Cancer Res 2004;10(15):5271–5281.   ). Specifically, HDAC2 is overexpressed in 76% of advanced gastric cancers (37 Song J, Noh JH, Lee JH, Eun JW, Ahn YM, Kim SY, Lee SH, Park WS, Yoo NJ, Lee JY, Nam SW. Increased expression of histone deacetylase 2 is found in human gastric cancer. APMIS 2005;113(4):264–268. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ) and HDAC1 is upregulated in 62% of lung cancers (38 Sasaki H, Moriyama S, Nakashima Y, Kobayashi Y, Kiriyama M, Fukai I, Yamakawa Y, Fujii Y. Histone deacetylase 1 mRNA expression in lung cancer. Lung Cancer 2004;46(2):171–178. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). Similar results have been observed in prostate cancer (39 Wang L, Zou X, Berger AD, Twiss C, Peng Y, Li Y, Chiu J, Guo H, Satagopan J, Wilton A, Gerald W, Basch R, Wang Z, Osman I, Lee P. Increased expression of histone deacetylaces (HDACs) and inhibition of prostate cancer growth and invasion by HDAC inhibitor SAHA. Am J Transl Res 2009;1(1):62–71. [PubMed], [Google Scholar] ), colon cancer (40 Mariadason JM. HDACs and HDAC inhibitors in colon cancer. Epigenetics 2008;3(1):28–37. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ) and breast cancer (41 Fan J, Yin WJ, Lu JS, Wang L, Wu J, Wu FY, Di GH, Shen ZZ, Shao ZM. ER alpha negative breast cancer cells restore response to endocrine therapy by combination treatment with both HDAC inhibitor and DNMT inhibitor. J Cancer Res Clin Oncol 2008; 134(8):883–890. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ). The deacetylase SIRT1 is also upregulated in a variety of cancer cell lines and tumors (42 Firestein R, Blander G, Michan S, Oberdoerffer P, Ogino S, Campbell J, Bhimavarapu A, Luikenhuis S, de Cabo R, Fuchs C, Hahn WC, Guarente LP, Sinclair DA. The SIRT1 deacetylase suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis and colon cancer growth. PLoS One 2008;3(4):e2020. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Google Scholar] ). SIRT1 deacetylates lysine residues in histones as well as in nonhistone proteins, including cancer-related factors; such as FoxO, p53, and NF-kB. This activity of SIRT1 is thought to play a key role in promoting cell survival under genotoxic and oxidative stresses (43, 44 Vinciguerra M, Santini MP, Claycomb WC, Ladurner AG, Rosenthal N. Local IGF-1 isoform protects cardiomyocytes from hypertrophic and oxidative stresses via SirT1 activity. Aging (Albany NY) 2010;2(1):43–62. Yi J, Luo J. SIRT1 and p53, effect on cancer, senescence and beyond. Biochim Biophys Acta 2010;1804(8):1684–1689.   ). In the current study, we observed that HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC5 and SIRT1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in ESCC samples compared with donor-matched healthy control tissue. Furthermore, the expression of HDAC1, HDAC2, and SIRT1 was significantly higher in stage III/IV tumors than that in stage I/II tumors, suggesting that the overexpression of these HDACs is involved in the progression of ESCC.  In our study, we found that abnormal histone acetylation and methylation levels in ESCC were closely correlated with tumor stage and histological differentiation. This finding indicates that analyzing changes in histone modification pattern may have potential applications in the diagnosis and prognosis estimation of ESCC. Studies using epigenetic drugs such as TSA, a HDAC inhibitor that can increase histone acetylation levels and re-establish the normal expression of regulatory genes silenced in cancers (40, 41 Mariadason JM. HDACs and HDAC inhibitors in colon cancer. Epigenetics 2008;3(1):28–37. Fan J, Yin WJ, Lu JS, Wang L, Wu J, Wu FY, Di GH, Shen ZZ, Shao ZM. ER alpha negative breast cancer cells restore response to endocrine therapy by combination treatment with both HDAC inhibitor and DNMT inhibitor. J Cancer Res Clin Oncol 2008; 134(8):883–890.   , 45 Stimson L, La Thangue NB. Biomarkers for predicting clinical responses to HDAC inhibitors. Cancer Lett 2009;280(2):177–183. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ), may provide new clues for the treatment of ESCC. In another example, Zhang and colleagues (46 Zhang B, Wang Y, Pang X. Enhanced radiosensitivity of EC109 cells by inhibition of HDAC1 expression. Med Oncol 2010; Epub ahead of print. ] [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ) showed that RNAi efficiently inhibits HDAC1 expression in ECa109 cells, effectively normalizing H3 acetylation levels and increasing the sensitivity to irradiation-dependent apoptosis. Additionally, Murakami and colleagues (47 Murakami K, Matsubara H, Hoshino I, Akutsu Y, Miyazawa Y, Matsushita K, Sakata H, Nishimori T, Usui A, Kano M, Nishino N, Yoshida M. CHAP31 induces apoptosis only via the intrinsic pathway in human esophageal cancer cells. Oncology 2010;78(1):62–74. [CrossRef], [PubMed], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar] ) documented an anti-proliferative effect of CHAP31, a novel HDAC inhibitor, on ESCC cells.  In summary, our results demonstrated abnormal histone acetylation and methylation levels and expressions of chromatin modifier genes in ESCC, suggesting that aberrant histone modification may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ESCC. These findings provide new insight into the epigenetic pathogenesis of ESCC and the potential reversibility of these epigenetic abnormalities.  
1083||EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, catalyzes the mono- through trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27). Histone H3K27 trimethylation is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification. Point mutations of the EZH2 gene (Tyr641) have been reported to be linked to subsets of human B-cell lymphoma. The mutant allele is always found associated with a wild-type allele (heterozygous) in disease cells, and the mutations were reported to ablate the enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex for methylating an unmodified peptide substrate. Here we demonstrate that the WT enzyme displays greatest catalytic efficiency (kcat/K) for the zero to monomethylation reaction of H3K27 and diminished efficiency for subsequent (mono- to di- and di- to trimethylation) reactions. In stark contrast, the disease-associated Y641 mutations display very limited ability to perform the first methylation reaction, but have enhanced catalytic efficiency for the subsequent reactions, relative to the WT enzyme. These results imply that the malignant phenotype of disease requires the combined activities of a H3K27 monomethylating enzyme (PRC2 containing WT EZH2 or EZH1) together with the mutant PRC2s for augmented conversion of H3K27 to the trimethylated form. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a human disease that is dependent on the coordinated activities of normal and disease-associated mutant enzymatic function.  Keywords: cancer, enzymology, epigenetics Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a 4 or 5 protein complex that functionally represses gene transcription via posttranslational modification of the chromatin core protein, histone H3. More specifically, PRC2 functions as a histone methyltransferase, catalyzing the selective methylation of lysine residue 27 on histone H3 (H3K27). EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, catalyzing the mono- through trimethylation of H3K27. Trimethylation of H3K27 is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification.  Recently, somatic mutations of Tyr641 (Y641F, Y641N, Y641S, and Y641H) of EZH2 were reported to be associated with follicular lymphoma (FL) and the germinal-center B-cell like (GCB) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (1). In all cases, occurrence of the mutant EZH2 gene was heterozygous, and expression of both WT and mutant alleles was detected in the mutant samples profiled by transcriptome sequencing. It was also demonstrated that all of the mutant forms of EZH2 could be incorporated into the multiprotein PRC2 complex, but that the resulting complexes lacked the ability to catalyze methylation of the H3K27 equivalent residue of a peptidic substrate. Hence, it was concluded that the disease-associated changes at Tyr641 resulted in loss of function with respect to EZH2-catalyzed H3K27 methylation.  A presumptive reduction in the rate of H3K27 methylation due to enzyme heterozygosity seemed to us to be difficult to rationalize as the basis for a malignant phenotype (1, 2), especially in light of previous data indicating that overexpression of EZH2 (3–6), loss-of-function mutations in the corresponding H3K27 demethylase UTX (7), or overexpression of components of the PRC2, such as PHF19/PCL3 involved in increased H3K27 trimethylation (8–10), all result in malignant phenotypes in specific human cancers. Several recent reports indicate that an important component of early lymphomagenesis is the acquisition of stem cell-like characteristics (11, 12). Among these characteristics is enriched DNA methylation of PRC2 target genes, resulting in diminished transcription of these genes (13). Trimethylation of H3K27, catalyzed by the enzymatic activity of EZH2, similarly leads to diminished transcription of these same genes and has thus been reported as an additional, potential progenitor of lymphomagenesis (11–14). EZH2 levels have also directly been implicated in lymphogenesis. For example, Velichutina et al. (14) found that EZH2 mRNA level was directly correlated with cellular proliferation in primary germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tumors, whereas levels of many EZH2 target genes were negatively correlated with proliferation in these same tumors. Likewise, expression levels of EZH2 and the PRC1 component BMI1 have both been linked to lymphogenesis and the degree of malignancy of B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas (15). We were thus motivated to explore the enzymology of the EZH2 mutants in greater detail.  Go to: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Recombinant PRC2 complexes (16) were prepared with WT and Tyr641 mutant versions of human EZH2 (see Materials and Methods). Equal concentrations (nominally 8 nM, based on protein determinations) of each complex were initially tested for the ability to catalyze 3H-methyl transfer from labeled SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) to an unmodified peptide representing the amino acid sequence surrounding H3K27 (H3:21-44) or to native avian erythrocyte oligonucleosomes. As previously reported (1), we found that the WT enzyme displayed robust activity for methyl transfer to this peptidic substrate, but that none of the mutant enzymes displayed significant methyltransferase activity (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the previously reported data and that in Fig. 1A, we found that all of the mutant EZH2 constructs were active methyltransferases against the avian nucleosome substrate (Fig. 1B).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. B-cell lymphoma-associated mutants of EZH2 are active histone methyltransferases. In vitro methyltransferase activity of PRC2 complexes containing wild-type and various Y641 mutants of EZH2 was measured as (A) methyl transfer reactions using a peptide ... There are several potential explanations for the discordant activity of the mutant PRC2 complexes on peptide and nucleosome substrates. One possibility is that substrate recognition sites distal to the enzyme active site (i.e., exosites) are important determinants of substrate binding and turnover; these sites would engage complementary recognition elements on the nucelosome that are not available on small peptidic substrates. However, when Escherichia coli-expressed, recombinant human histone H3 was tested as a substrate for the WT and mutant PRC2 complexes, the resulting pattern of activity was identical to that seen for the peptide substrate (see Supporting Information); that is, the WT enzyme demonstrated robust methyltransferase activity against the H3 substrate, the Y641F mutant showed 7% the activity of WT complex, and all other mutants displayed ≤ 1% the activity of WT complex. Hence, exosite engagement seems an unlikely explanation for the current results. The nucleosome presents many lysine residues beyond H3K27 as potential sites of methylation that would not be present in the small peptidic substrate. Thus, another possibility is that mutation of Y641 alters the substrate specificity of EZH2 to result in methylation of lysine residues other than H3K27. This possibility is unlikely given the excellent agreement between mutant activity on small peptide and recombinant H3 protein substrates. To evaluate this possibility further, we tested the enzymatic activity of the WT and mutant PRC2 complexes against a panel of peptidic substrates that represent all possible lysine residues of histone H3 and histone H4 (see Materials and Methods). All of the enzyme forms showed significant activity only against peptides containing the equivalent of residue H3K27. The specific activity of the mutants, however, was greatly reduced relative to WT in the order WT≫Y641F > Y641S ∼ Y641H > Y641N, again consistent with previous reported findings. The nucleosomes isolated from the avian natural source represent an admixture of states of histone modification, including various states of H3K27 methylations as judged by Western blotting with H3K27 methylation specific antibodies. Hence, another possibility is that the Y641 mutants of EZH2 display differential activity against different methylation states of H3K27.  To understand further the enzymatic activity of these mutants, and to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between activity against peptidic and nucleosome substrates, we studied the ability of the enzyme forms to catalyze further methylation of various H3K27 methylation states in the context of the H3:21-44 peptide. As stated above, we found that all of the mutant enzymes were deficient catalysts of unmodified H3K27 peptide methylation, relative to the WT enzyme. To our surprise, however, all of the mutant enzymes were superior to the WT enzyme in catalyzing further methylation of the mono- and especially the dimethylated H3K27 peptides (Fig. 2). Thus, the data suggest that the WT enzyme is most efficient in catalyzing the zero to monomethylation reaction. The mutant enzymes are defective in catalyzing this initial step, but are more efficient than the WT enzyme in catalyzing the subsequent steps leading from monomethyl to di- and trimethyl H3K27.  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. PRC2 complexes containing mutant EZH2 preferentially catalyze di- and trimethylation of histone H3K27. (A) Methyltransferase activity of mutant and WT complexes on unmethylated peptide (open bars), monomethylated peptide (hatched bars), and dimethylated ... The origins of the differential substrate specificities of WT and mutant EZH2 were explored through steady-state enzyme kinetics. As summarized in Table 1, the mutations have minimal effects on ground-state substrate recognition, as demonstrated by the similar values of Km for nucleosome and of K1/2 for peptide substrates. In all cases the peptidic substrates displayed sigmoidal binding behavior; hence, the concentration of peptide resulting in half-maximal velocity is reported here as K1/2 instead of the more common Michaelis constant, Km (17). This sigmoidal behavior was seen only with peptidic substrates (i.e., nucleosome and recombinant histone substrates displayed classical Michaelis–Menten kinetics), and the origin of this effect is unclear at present. The SAM Km likewise displayed minimal variation among the enzyme forms, ranging from 208 ± 50 to 304 ± 64 nM. Instead, the differences in substrate utilization appear to have their origin in transition state recognition, as demonstrated by differences in kcat values among the enzymes for various substrates (Table 1); as a result, the catalytic efficiency, quantified as the ratio kcat/K (where K is either Km or K1/2, depending on substrate identity; see above), varies between the WT and mutant enzymes for different states of H3K27 methylation (Table 1).  Table 1. Table 1. Steady-state kinetic parameters for methylation reactions catalyzed by PRC2 containing wild-type or Y641 mutants of EZH2 The mutation of Y641 to F, N, H, or S in EZH2 may facilitate multiple rounds of H3K27 methylation by impacting the H-bonding pattern and/or steric crowding in the active site of the enzyme–bisubstrate ternary complex, affecting the formation of a proper water channel for deprotonation of the reacting lysine (18). This inference is drawn by analogy to the crystallographic and molecular dynamic simulation results seen for tyrosine mutation in the related protein lysine methyltransferases LSMT, Dim-5, and SET7/9. For example, when tyrosine 245 of recombinant SET7/9 was mutated to alanine, a change in substrate specificity, similar to what is reported here for EZH2 Y641 mutations, was observed (19). The ability of the Y245A mutant SET7/9 to methylate an unmodified 20-residue peptide, representing the sequence surrounding H3K4, was reduced to ca. 20% of the WT enzyme (20). At the same time, the ability of the Y245A mutant to further methylate H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 peptides was greatly augmented (ca. 7-fold and 5-fold, respectively) relative to the WT enzyme. In contrast to the present results, however, mutation of SET7/9 Y245 to phenylalanine did not enhance mono- to dimethylation nor di- to trimethylation of the peptide; rather, the Y245F mutant displayed minimal catalytic activity for all peptidic substrates. Similarly, the wild-type enzyme G9a can dimethylate H3K9 but is unable to perform the di- to trimethylation reaction. Yet, when tyrosine 1067 of G9a (analogous to Y641 of EZH2) is mutated to phenylalanine, the enzyme now gains the ability to trimethylate H3K9 (21). The tolerance for multiple Y641 mutations in EZH2 suggests that a release of steric crowding may allow greater access for proper alignment of the larger dimethyl lysine as the substrate for the di- to trimethylation reaction. Crystallographic analysis of the protein methyltransferases SET7/9 and G9a reveals that the side chain hydroxyls of the active site tyrosine residues are involved in H-bonding interactions directly with the amine of the methyl-accepting lysine, or indirectly through an intervening water molecule. Although the larger active site of the Y641 mutants is favorable for di- and trimethylation, the loss of the tyrosine hydroxyl hydrogen bond acceptor may result in an unfavorable orientation of the active site for initial methyl transfer to the lysine amine. A complete understanding of the molecular basis for the dramatic reduction in the ability of these mutant enzymes to perform the initial methylation reaction will require additional study.  The implications of the present results for human disease are made clear by the data summarized in Table 1. Cells heterozygous for EZH2 would be expected to display a malignant phenotype, due to the efficient formation of H3K27me1 by the WT enzyme and the efficient, subsequent transition of this progenitor species to abnormally high levels of H3K27me3 by the mutant enzyme form(s). We note that H3K27me1 formation is not exclusively dependent on WT-EZH2 catalysis. Knockout studies of EZH2 and of another PRC2 subunit, EED, have demonstrated H3K27me1 formation can be catalyzed by PRC2 complexes containing either EZH2 or the related protein EZH1, as the catalytic subunit (22). Hence, catalytic coupling between the mutant EZH2 species and PRC2 complexes containing either WT-EZH2 or WT-EZH1 would suffice to augment H3K27me3 formation and thus produce the attendant malignant phenotype. Our data therefore suggest that the malignant phenotype of FL and DLBCL of the GCB subtype, associated with expression of mutant forms of EZH2 (1), is the result of an overall gain of function with respect to formation of the trimethylated form of H3K27.  The steady-state kinetic parameters listed in Table 1 allow us to calculate the expected levels of different H3K27 methylation states for cells heterozygous for the various mutant EZH2 forms, relative to cells homozygous for the WT enzyme. To perform these simulations we made a number of simplifying assumptions: (i) that steady-state enzyme kinetics are relevant to PRC2-catalyzed H3K27 methylation in the cellular context and that all measurements are made at the same time point in cell growth; (ii) that the mutant and the WT enzyme are expressed at equal levels in heterozygous cells and that the total EZH2 level is equal in all cells; (iii) that the cellular concentration of SAM, relative to its Km, is saturating and does not change among the cells; (iv) that the cellular concentration of nucleosome is similar to its Km and likewise does not change among cells; (v) that EZH1 catalyzed methylation of H3K27 was insignificant and constant among the cells; and (vi) that any H3K27 demethylase activity was also constant among the cells. With these assumptions in place, we obtained the predictions illustrated in Fig. 3A for relative levels of H3K27me3 (Top), H3K27me2 (Middle), and H3K27me1 (Bottom). A clear pattern emerges from these simulations. The level of H3K27me3 increases relative to WT cells for all mutant-harboring cells, ranging from a 30% increase for the Y641H mutant to > 400% for the Y641N mutant. At the same time, the levels of H3K27me2 decrease to < 50% of WT for all of the mutants, and the levels of H3K27me1 are reduced by approximately half for all mutants, relative to WT. We then measured the relative levels of the H3K27 methylation states in B-cell lymphoma cell lines that are known to be homozygous for WT EZH2 (OCI-LY19) or heterozygous for EZH2 Y641N (DB, KARPAS 422, and SU-DHL-6) or EZH2 Y641F (WSU-DLCL2) by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). The pattern of relative H3K27 methylation states seen in Fig. 3B is in excellent agreement with the results of the simulations based on in vitro steady-state kinetic parameters, despite the crude assumptions used in the simulations and the use of a nonphysiological peptide surrogate as substrate. Thus, we observe increased H3K27me3 for all mutant-harboring cells relative to WT, decreased H3K27me2 for all mutant-harboring cells relative to WT, and decreased H3K27me1 for at least two of the four mutant cell lines. The near-comparable levels of H3K27me1 in WT and KARPAS 422 and SU-DHL-6 cells may reflect different expression levels of WT and mutant EZH2, different contributions of EZH1, or other factors not accounted for in our simulations. Nevertheless, the concordance between the predicted and experimental patterns of H3K27 methylation status is remarkable and supports our view that enzymatic coupling between WT and mutant EZH2 leads to increased H3K27me3, thus resulting in the malignant phenotype of cells that are heterozygous for these mutants.  Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Steady-state enzyme kinetics predicts the relative patterns of H3K27 methylation status in EZH2 WT and heterozygous mutant lymphoma cell lines. (A) Predicted relative levels of H3K27me3 (Top), H3K27me2 (Middle), and H3K27me1 (Bottom) for cells containing ... The foregoing interpretation of our data also helps to reconcile the existence of cancer-associated overexpression of EZH2 (3–6) or PRC2-associated proteins (e.g., PHF19/PCL3) (8–10) and also loss-of-function genotypes for the histone H3K27 demethylase UTX (7). Loss of UTX activity would be enzymatically equivalent to a gain of function for EZH2, in either situation resulting in greater steady-state levels of trimethylated H3K27 in cancer cells (Fig. 4). The mono-, di-, and trimethylation states of histone H3K27 are associated with different functions in transcriptional control. Histone H3K27 monomethylation is associated with active transcription of genes that are poised for transcription (23, 24). In contrast, trimethylation of histone H3K27 is associated with either transcriptionally repressed genes (23, 25) or genes that are poised for transcription when histone H3K4 trimethylation is in cis (26). Taken together, alterations in the PRC2 complex activity reported in cancer, including the Y641 mutation of EZH2, are predicted to result in an increase in the trimethylated state of histone H3K27 and to thus result in transcriptional repression.  Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Proposed mechanisms leading to aberrantly high levels of trimethylation on histone H3K27 in cancer include (A) mutation of Y641 in EZH2 resulting in a change in substrate preference from the nonmethylated to the mono- and dimethylated histone H3K27, ( ... EZH2 and other protein methyltransferases have been suggested to be attractive targets for drug discovery (27–29). The present data also suggest an experimental strategy for development of FL and GCB lymphoma-specific drugs. As the differences in substrate recognition between the WT and disease-associated mutants derive from transition state interactions, small molecule inhibitors that selectively mimic the transition state of the mutant EZH2 over that of the WT enzyme should prove to be effective in blocking H3K27 methylation in mutation-bearing cells. Inhibitors of this type would be expected to display a large therapeutic index, as target-mediated toxicity would be minimal for any cells bearing only the WT enzyme. Transition state mimicry has proved to be an effective strategy for drug design in many disease areas (17, 30). Whether or not sufficient differentiation between the transition states of the WT and mutant EZH2 enzymes can be designed into a small molecule drug remains to be determined.  In summary, the present results point to a critical dependency on enzymatic coupling between enzymes that perform H3K27 monomethylation and the mutant forms of EZH2, for pathogenesis in FL and the GCB subtype of DLBCL. This is an example of a human disease that is dependent on such coupling of catalytic activity between normal (H3K27me1) and disease-associated mutant (H3K27me2/3) enzymes. We are unaware of other examples of this mechanism of pathogenesis in human disease.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Recombinant 5-Component PRC2. Wild-type EZH2 (NM_004456) or Tyr641 mutants were coexpressed with wild-type AEBP2 (NM_153207), EED (NM_003797), SUZ12 (NM_015355), and RbAp48 (NM_005610) in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using a baculovirus expression system. An N-terminal FLAG tag on the EED was used to purify active PRC2 complex from cell lysates (BPS Bioscience, catalog number 51004). The purity of the final PRC2 preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining.  Recombinant Human Histone H3. Recombinant human histone H3.1, expressed in and purified from E. coli (catalog number M250S) was purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc.  H3, H4 Peptide Panel. A library consisting of 44 peptides of 15 amino acids each was synthesized by 21st Century Biochemicals. This peptide panel encompassed all of the amino acids of human histones H3 and H4 with 10 residue overlaps between consecutive peptide sequences. The N terminus of each peptide was appended with biotin, and the C termini were represented as the amide. Purity (> 95%) and identity were confirmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectral analysis.  For study of the H3K27 methylation status dependence of enzyme activity, peptides were synthesized representing the amino acid sequence of human H3 from residues 21–44 (H3:21–44) with lysine 27 represented as the unmodified, monomethylated, dimethylated, or trimethylated side chain amine. These peptides were purchased from New England Peptide with biotin appended to the C terminus of each peptide.  In Vitro Assays of PRC2 Methyltransferase Activity. Flashplate assay with peptide substrate. For initial comparison of WT and Y641 mutants of EZH2, biotinylated histone H3:21-44 peptide containing unmethylated K27 (New England Peptide), monomethylated K27 (Millipore), or dimethylated K27 (Millipore) at a concentration of 800 nM was combined with a mixture of SAM at 1,700 nM, and 300 nM tritiated SAM (PerkinElmer, Inc.). This substrate combination was then added to the PRC2 in assay buffer [20 mM N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine (Bicine), 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween20, 0.005% bovine skin gelatin (BSG), pH 7.6]. Reactions were allowed to proceed for the indicated time interval and then quenched by addition of excess cold SAM (600-μM final concentration). Quenched reaction mixtures were transferred to a streptavidin-coated Flashplate (PerkinElmer, catalog number SMP410), allowed to bind for 1 h, and then detected on a TopCount NXT HTS (PerkinElmer). Each time point represents the average of six individual reactions. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined under identical reaction conditions except that the concentration of peptide or SAM was varied, while at saturating conditions of the other substrate. Velocity was plotted as a function of varied substrate concentration and the data were fitted to the untransformed version of the Michaelis–Menten equation or the untransformed version of a sigmoidal kinetic equation (30) to calculate values of K and kcat (30). Standard errors of fitted parameters are listed in Table 1 and were used to construct the error bars illustrated in Fig. 2 B and C. Errors associated with kcat/K (Table 1) were calculated according to standard methods of error propogation; the fractional error of kcat/K was determined as  equation image	[1] where μkcat is the standard error of kcat and μK is the standard error of K.  Filterplate assay with histone and oligonucleosome. Chicken erythrocyte oligonucleosomes were purified as previously described (31). Nucleosomes or histones were combined with a mixture of SAM and tritiated SAM and added to PRC2 in assay buffer (20 mM Bicine, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween20, 0.005% BSG, pH 7.6). Reactions were run and quenched as above. Quenched reaction mixture was transferred to a glass fiber filterplate (Millipore, catalog number MSFBN6B) and washed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid and allowed to dry. Microscint Zero (30 μL) was added and tritium incorporation was detected on a TopCount. Steady-state parameters for reactions with nucelosomes were determined under identical reaction conditions except that the concentration of nucleosome or SAM was varied while at saturating conditions of the other substrate. Velocity was plotted as a function of varied substrate concentration and fitted to the untransformed version of the Michaelis–Menten equation to derive the values of Km and kcat as described above.  Evaluation of H3K27 methylation status in cells. The cell lines OCI-LY19 (ACC 528), KARPAS-422 (ACC 32), and WSU-DLCL2 (ACC 575) were obtained from DSMZ. The cell lines DB (CRL-2289) and SU-DHL2 (CRL-2959) were obtained from ATCC. OCI-LY19, WSU-DLCL2, and DB cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, and KARPAS-422 and SU-DHL2 cell lines were grown in RPMI medium 1640 plus 20% FBS. Cells were grown to a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/mL and 1 × 107 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 264  × g, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed by resuspension in a 10× pellet volume of RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, and 1mM EDTA (Millipore #20-188), plus 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche # 1836153). Lysates were sonicated by two rounds of ten 1-s bursts at setting 3 with a Misonix XL-2000 to ensure efficient histone extraction, and cleared by centrifugation at 4° using a bench top centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Four micrograms of each lysate was fractionated on 4–20% Tris-Glycine gel (Invitrogen), transferred to PVDF, and probed with the following antibodies in Odyssey blocking buffer: mouse anti-EZH2 (CST 3147; 1∶2,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (CST 9733; 1∶10,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me2 (CST 9755; 1∶5,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me1 (Active Motif 39377; 1∶5,000 dilution), and mouse antiTotal H3 (CST 3638; 1∶20,000 dilution). Following primary Ab incubation, membranes were probed with IRDye 800CW donkey-anti-mouse IgG (LiCOR #926-32212) or Alexa Fluor 680 goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen #A-21076) secondary Ab and imaged using the LiCOR Odyssey system.  Next-generation sequencing of follicular lymphoma and diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma has revealed frequent somatic, heterozygous Y641 mutations in the histone methyltransferase EZH2. Heterozygosity and the presence of equal quantities of both mutant and wild-type mRNA and expressed protein suggest a dominant mode of action. Surprisingly, B-cell lymphoma cell lines and lymphoma samples harboring heterozygous EZH2Y641 mutations have increased levels of histone H3 Lys-27–specific trimethylation (H3K27me3). Expression of EZH2Y641F/N mutants in cells with EZH2WT resulted in an increase of H3K27me3 levels in vivo. Structural modeling of EZH2Y641 mutants suggests a “Tyr/Phe switch” model whereby structurally neutral, nontyrosine residues at position 641 would decrease affinity for unmethylated and monomethylated H3K27 substrates and potentially favor trimethylation. We demonstrate, using in vitro enzyme assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, that Y641 mutations result in a decrease in monomethylation and an increase in trimethylation activity of the enzyme relative to the wild-type enzyme. This represents the first example of a disease-associated gain-of-function mutation in a histone methyltransferase, whereby somatic EZH2 Y641 mutations in lymphoma act dominantly to increase, rather than decrease, histone methylation. The dominant mode of action suggests that allele-specific EZH2 inhibitors should be a future therapeutic strategy for this disease.  Go to: Introduction Non-Hodgkin lymphomas represent a diverse spectrum of distinct entities with the 2 most common types represented by follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). There are 2 molecular subtypes of DLBCL based on cell-of-origin distinctions: the activated B-cell type and the germinal center B-cell (GCB) type. Both follicular lymphoma and the GCB subtype of DLBCL derive from germinal center B cells. We have shown that, in 7% of follicular lymphomas and 22% of GCB-type DLBCL, a single point mutation in EZH2, which results in a single amino-acid change at position 641, is selected for; EZH2 (Tyr641 or WT) was mutated to phenylalanine (Y641F), asparagine (Y641N), histidine (Y641H), or serine (Y641S).1 EZH2 has been implicated as an oncoprotein often overexpressed in many solid tumors.2–4 Initial analysis of the activity of Y641 variants in cell-free reconstituted Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) complexes using unmethylated peptides suggested that the mutations behaved as a loss of function.1  EZH2 is the catalytic member of the PRC2; however, EZH2 alone has very weak histone-methylating activity. Other members of the PRC2 complex include EED, SUZ12, AEBP2, and RbAp48 and are required for full activity. The PRC2 complex has been shown to exhibit in vitro enzyme activity on histone peptide substrates and nucleosomes. EZH2 is a member of the Su(var)3,9, enhancer of zest, Trithorax (SET) domain containing family of histone methyltransferases (HMTases); all contain a conserved SET domain. Genetic and biochemical analysis of EZH2 SET domain has revealed their histone methyltransferase function associated with histone H3 Lys-27–specific trimethylation (H3K27me3) in vivo. Recently, a structural basis for the allosteric modulation of EZH2 activity by EED has been elucidated.5  Structural and biochemical data from other SET domain HMTases have shed light not only on the molecular mechanism of histone methylation but also the specific residues of the conserved SET domain responsible for these reactions. For example, all active HMTases contain a catalytic triad—the asparagine-histidine-serine (NHS) motif,6 and mutation of any one of these residues in the active site abolishes the activity of the enzyme. Studies have also implicated residues important for the binding of the S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)7 and for recognition of the amino-acid sequence of the histone peptide tail.8 However, these studies have not shed light on the role of the highly evolutionarily conserved Tyr 641 of EZH2.  Through the use of molecular modeling and recently published molecular and biochemical data from an allelic series of G9a9 and by analogy to the “Tyr/Phe” switch alleles in other methyltransferases,10,11 we show that Tyr 641 of EZH2 is implicated in substrate and product specificity. Taken together with the finding that DLBCL cell lines heterozygous for EZH2 mutants exhibit higher steady-state levels of H3K27me3 and in vitro enzyme studies, a possible mechanism may be proposed. This report provides evidence that EZH2 Y641 mutant protein-containing PRC2 complexes exhibit increased activity on dimethylated peptides compared with wild-type containing PRC2 complexes, thereby shifting the steady state of H3K27 to favor trimethylation in vivo. As previously described, the EZH2 mutant-containing PRC2 complexes are inactive on unmethylated histone peptides,1 implying that the Y641F/N mutations can only act in the presence of a wild-type EZH2.

The purity for each peptide was assessed using mass spectrometry to be more than 95% (data not shown) and identity confirmed by dot blotting (supplemental Figure 3).  Clinical samples. Snap-frozen initial diagnostic lymph node biopsies with a confirmed diagnosis of DLBCL were studied. In total, 10 cases were analyzed by Western blotting, including 5 cases with confirmed wild-type EZH2 and 5 mutant cases. All cases were identified by whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing, and the DNA status then confirmed by Sanger sequencing.9 Informed consent for these studies was obtained for all patients together with research ethics approval in accordance with the British Columbia Cancer Agency policy and the Declaration of Helsinki.  Cell lines and transfection  DLBCL cell lines harboring EZH2WT or heterozygous for EZH2Y641F or EZH2Y641N (imported from the DSMZ; www.dsmz.de) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells (150 000 cells per well of a 6-well plate) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or TransIT−LT1 (Mirus) with 1 to 5 μg of plasmids. Stable cell lines were made by transfection of HEK293T cells with the respective plasmids and then selection with blasticidine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 week. Pools of stable lines expressing GFP-alone or GFP-tagged proteins were used for the experiments.  Western blotting and immunoprecipitation  Standard methods of Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were used; details are in the supplemental data. Densitometry measurements of bands were used to calculate H3K27me3/totalH3 by integrating each peak in ImageJ (1.44n, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij) software.  Large-scale immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry  A total of 3 × 108 cells from the WSU-DLCL2 and DOHH2 cell lines were harvested, and nuclear lysates were prepared as described in the supplemental data. For large-scale immunoprecipitations, 160 mg of nuclear lysates was diluted with binding buffer and precleared with Sepharose 4B for 1 hour at 4°C. EZH2 complexes were immunoprecipitated with 30 μg of anti-EZH2 antibody (#612667, BD Biosciences) by rotating overnight at 4°C. Antibody-bound protein complexes were then incubated with 120 μL of Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 4°C. Bound EZH2 complexes were washed 5 times with 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 30 μL of sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading dye. Samples were resolved using a 4% to 12% gradient gel (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and stained with colloidal Coomassie stain. After destaining, the gel was cut into 16 slices per lane corresponding to a specific molecular weight range. In-gel trypsin digestion was performed, and peptides were extracted from the gel using standard protocols.16  High-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry (MS) was performed on a 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/Sciex) coupled to an Agilent 1100 Nano-HPLC (Agilent Technologies) using a nano-electrospray interface, as described in supplemental data.  Histone methyltransferase assay  Similar batches of recombinant reconstituted active PRC2 complexes as used previously1 containing EZH2WT(51 004), EZH2Y641N, or EZH2Y641F were purchased from BPS Biosciences. Methyltransferase assays were performed using a kit (#17-330, Millipore) as per the manufacturer's instructions, except that biotinylated peptides were used as substrates; 250 ng of active PRC2 complex was incubated with 0.67μM 3H-SAM (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences), 1μM biotinylated peptide in 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 0.5mM dithiothreitol for 30 minutes at 30°C in a 10-μL volume. A total of 5 μL was spotted on a P81 square paper (Millipore), washed (twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid and once with 100% ethanol) to remove unincorporated SAM, air-dried, and placed in a glass scintillation vial with 5 mL of scintillation fluid (ScintiSafe Econo1, Fisher Chemical) and counted on a 1900TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).  Modeling  A model of the EZH2 core catalytic domain lining the substrate lysine binding channel was built by homology to the G9a/EHMT2 structure (PDB code 2o8j), based on the alignment shown in supplemental Figure 6 and supplemental Figure 8. The EZH2 sequence was threaded onto the G9a backbone, and when homologous, G9a side chains were used as a template to position EZH2 residues, according to the “minimize tethers” command using ICM, Version 3.6-1g (Molsoft LLC17).  Retroviral infection and B-cell in vitro differentiation assay  Parental strain mice were bred and maintained as approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. Primary mouse bone marrow cells were transduced as previously described with minor modifications.18 Details are in the supplemental data.  Go to: Results EZH2Y641F/N proteins are expressed approximately 1:1 with wild-type EZH2 in DLBCL cell lines  Conspicuously, the EZH2 mutations identified in GCB lymphomas are all located in exon 15 of EZH2, and all are missense mutations that change a single highly evolutionarily conserved tyrosine residue in the catalytic SET domain (Tyr641 or WT) to phenylalanine (Y641F), asparagine (Y641N), histidine (Y641H), or serine (Y641S).1 This recurrent pattern of a heterozygous somatic mutation in a functionally conserved region, affecting a single residue, is highly suggestive of a gain of dominant mode of action, either dominant negative or a gain-of-function/neomorph. Both wild-type (EZH2WT) and EZH2Y641 variant transcripts could be observed in lymphoma-derived cell lines (Y641N: DB, Karpas 422, SU-DHL-6, and Y641F: WSU-DLCL-2) bearing the mutations (supplemental Figure 1). Potentially, the mutations at EZH2Y641 could alter the stability of the protein. To investigate this possibility, we developed a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode MS signature for tryptic peptides covering the mutated region of EZH2 (wild-type, MutF) and a common region from tandem MS spectra of recombinant EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F (Figure 1A; supplemental Figure 2A-B) and used this to estimate the abundance of mutant EZH2 in malignant cells. To determine the amount of mutant EZH2 in a DLCBL cell line, we immunoprecipitated total endogenous EZH2 from nuclear lysates of the WSU-DLCL2 cell line (EZH2Y641F) and the DOHH2 cell line (EZH2WT) from 2 independent experiments. Gel electrophoresis fractions of the immunoprecipitates encompassing the size of EZH2 were analyzed for the peptides by MRM-MS. Signals for the wild-type, MutF, and common peptides were observed in the WSU-DLCL2 cell line, whereas only wild-type and common signals were observed in the DOHH2 cell line (Figure 1B; supplemental Figure 2C; and data not shown), demonstrating that both EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F proteins were present in the WSU-DLCL2 cell line. The wild-type/MutF peak area ratios were compared with the wild-type/MutF peak area ratios of an external standard curve of mixtures of recombinant EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F (Figure 1C). The percentage EZH2WT was calculated from an equation fit to the standard curve. The comparison indicated that there was a 40:60 EZH2WT/EZH2Y641F protein ratio in the WSU-DLCL2 sample (Figure 1C; supplemental Figure 2C); thus, approximately equal quantities of mutant EZH2 protein are present, showing that the mutations do not adversely affect the stability of the protein in vivo and therefore that any differences in activity should not be explained by a highly skewed ratio of wild-type and mutant proteins alone.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Quantitation of EZH2 wild-type and EZH2 Y641F (MutF) protein expression by mass spectrometry.

EZH2Y641 mutation bearing B-cell lymphoma cell lines and GCB lymphoma containing tissues exhibit higher levels of H3K27me3 than wild-type  Initial studies1 of EZH2Y641F/N cell-free, reconstituted PRC2 complexes showed that the mutant EZH2-containing PRC2 complexes had 7-fold less activity in converting unmethylated H3K27 target peptides, compared with wild-type. This would suggest that mutation-bearing cell lines and tumors should have globally reduced H3K27me3 levels. A direct comparison is complicated by the nonisogenic status of the cell lines and, in the case of primary tumor material, by variable tumor cellularity. Nevertheless, we measured H3K27me3 (with 2 different H3K27me3 antibodies, verified for monospecificity; see “Western blotting and immunoprecipitation”; supplemental Figure 3) with respect to total H3, in a series of GCB-derived lymphoma cell lines, sequenced to determine the presence or absence of Y641 mutations. Unexpectedly, we found that EZH2Y641F/N bearing cell lines (Figure 2A,G) and tumors (Figure 2B,H) generally exhibited greater levels of H3K27me3 than wild-type cases, suggesting hyperactivity of the PRC2 complexes.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Y641 mutations in B-cell lines and tumors increase steady state of H3K27me3. (A) Steady-state H3K27me3 levels in DLBCL. Nuclear lysates from DLCBCLs with either wild-type EZH2 (Pfeiffer, MD903, NU-DHL-1, NU-DUL-1, DOHH2, and Toledo) or heterozygous for ... EZH2Y641F/N mutants act dominantly in HEK293T and in vitro differentiated B cells to increase H3K27me3 levels  The first 2 sets of observations strongly suggested that EZH2Y641F/N mutants could act dominantly in cells to increase H3K27me3. To test this idea, we expressed wild-type and EZH2Y641F/N proteins in HEK293T cells (wild-type for EZH2) and measured the effect on total H3K27me3 levels. Both stable and transient expression of EZH2Y641F/N mutant proteins in a wild-type context (HEK293T cells) results in a significant increase in H3K27me3 (Figure 2C; supplemental Figure 4), whereas wild-type EZH2 or the methyltransferase dead EZH2H689A,19 expressed in the same cell types results in a barely detectable increase in H3K27me3 (Figure 2D). Notably, the increase in the steady-state levels of H3K27me3 occurred, even though stable expression of GFP-EZH2Y641 protein was lower compared with endogenous EZH2 (Figure 2C upper band). To show that GFP-EZH2 was expressed as part of the PRC2,13 we immunoprecipitated GFP-tagged EZH2 and probed with EZH2, EED, or SUZ12. As shown in Figure 2E, mutant EZH2 was able to coprecipitate with other members of the PRC2 complex. EZH2Y641 mutants thus shifted the in vivo equilibrium levels of H3K27 methylation from monomethylation and dimethylation to predominantly trimethylation (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the cell lines bearing EZH2Y641F/N mutations are also uniformly and markedly more resistant (supplemental Figure 5) to 3-deazaneplanocin A, a global small-molecule inhibitor of single-carbon transfer methyltransferases, which has been reported as a nonspecific inhibitor of EZH2 activity20,21 (specific inhibitors have yet to be described). Finally, we asked whether Y641 variants were capable of conferring a gain of H3K27me3 on B-cell lineages in the mouse. Primary murine primary bone marrow cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing GFP and either wild-type EZH2 or EZH2Y641F and differentiated into the B-cell lineage in the presence of IL7 and FLT3-L. Measurement of total H3K27me3 again showed increased H3K27me3 (Figure 2F) in cells bearing EZH2Y641F, whereas EZH2WT constructs did not confer this phenotype (Figure 2F).  Structural modeling suggests that Tyr 641 residue may be involved in product equilibrium  We sought to understand why EZH2Y641F/N variants act dominantly through a structural analysis of this region in EZH2. Scanning mutagenesis and solved structures have provided insights into regions governing substrate preferences and specificity of several methytransferases; however, a fully solved structure of the EZH2 protein is not currently available. We therefore undertook structural homology modeling of the catalytic core region of EZH2 on the high resolution crystal structures of the lysine dimethyltransferase, G9a, and the lysine monomethyltransferase, SETD7 for which there are also detailed enzymatic data9,10 (Figure 3; supplemental Figures 6-8). Y641 of EZH2 aligns with Y1067 in G9a, which when mutated to Phe was recently shown to convert G9a into a trimethyltransferase with a concomitant decrease in monomethylation and dimethylation activity.9 Similarly, the analogous residue in SETD7 (Y245) can also confer trimethyltransferase activity on SETD7 when mutated to Ala.10 The structures reveal that Tyr in this position forms a hydrogen bond with the substrate lysine amino nitrogen moiety and keeps one of its lone pair electrons oriented away from the SAM methyl donor (Figure 3 black arrow). Thus, this Tyr residue “ties up” the face of the recipient lysyl nitrogen to which the third methyl would otherwise be transferred. This Tyr-substrate hydrogen bond also contributes to the preferred binding affinity of the enzyme for monomethylated and unmethylated substrates as evidenced by the weaker Km values of the Y1067F G9a mutants for unmethylated and monomethylated substrates.9 Furthermore, the Km of G9a Y1067F for dimethylated substrate reflects a stronger affinity for H3K27me2 than for monomethylated or unmethylated substrates.9 In the trimethyltransferases, such as EZH2, this tyrosine residue is also conserved, probably facilitating the first 2 methyl transfer reactions. Because the active sites of EZH2WT can also accommodate a third methyl group, it has probably evolved a compromise between monomethylation, dimethylation, and trimethylation (relative to G9a, for example), perhaps via small structural adjustments that allow it to carry out trimethylation, even in the presence of the Y641 residue. Thus, mutation of Y641 in EZH2 to residues, such as Phe (F) or Asn (N), which do not disturb the structure, can be predicted to abrogate the affinity for unmethylated or monomethylated lysine substrates while at the same time reducing steric crowding in the active site, thereby potentially facilitating the catalytic efficiency for trimethylation.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Homology model of the active site of EZH2. The model is based on sequence and structure alignment with histone dimethyltransferase G9a/EHMT2 (PDBID 2O8J).9 This was also structurally aligned with GLP/EHMT1 bound to an H3K9me2 peptide substrate (PDBID ... Mutations of these tyrosine residues (analogous to Y641 in EZH2) result in a shift of product equilibrium to favor the trimethylated state. The structural and functional basis of the substitution of Tyr to smaller residues, particularly Phe, is known as the Tyr/Phe switch.11,22 Although the Tyr/Phe switch has been described at other residues from scanning mutagenesis in vitro, this is the first example of a disease-associated Tyr/Phe switch.  EZH2Y641-containing PRC2 complexes show increased substrate preference for dimethylated peptide in vitro  To test the structural hypothesis that EZH2Y641 mutations have a reduced ability to methylate H3K27me0/1 substrates but increased ability to methylate H3K27me2 substrates, we next studied the function of the enzyme in vitro. Because the relative catalytic efficiency of the EZH2/PRC2 complex for each methyl addition step is poorly understood, we carried out a 3H methyl incorporation assay using recombinant PRC2 complexes,23 containing EED, SUZ12, AEBP2, RbAp48, and wild-type or EZH2Y641 mutants, as previously described.1 We assayed the activity of the variant proteins by measuring 3H-methyl incorporation, using unmodified, chemically synthesized monomethylated and dimethylated K27 substrate peptides, in preference to nucleosomes because the latter contain endogenous histone modifications (supplemental Figure 3) that make nucleosome assays difficult to interpret (supplemental Figure 9). Strikingly, EZH2Y641 mutants showed (Figure 4) strongly reduced activity on unmethylated or monomethylated peptides but markedly enhanced activity on dimethylated peptides compared with EZH2 wild-type containing PRC2 complexes. We estimated the specific activity of the protein complexes (Table 1) and observed that the EZH2Y641F/N containing PRC2 complexes are approximately twice as active on dimethylated peptides compared with wild-type. These data indicate that EZH2Y641F/N mutations alter the substrate specificity, as suggested by the structural model, in favor of dimethylated peptides compared with PRC2 containing complexes with only wild-type EZH2.  Figure 4 Figure 4 In vitro PRC2 activity of EZH2. Histone methyltransferase reaction was performed using 1.2μM biotinylated peptide substrate (ie, peptide mimicking the H3 tail, H3(21-44)), which has been unmethylated (H3K27me0, open bar or me0), monomethylated ... Table 1 Table 1 Specific activity of PRC2 complexes Go to: Discussion The relevance of somatic mutations in chromatin-modifying enzymes in cancer has recently been emphasized by discoveries of high-frequency somatic mutations in UTX, JMJD demethylases, ARID1A, and in EZH2.1,24–27 However, the mechanisms by which these mutations promote or enable carcinogenesis are largely unknown, as are the relevant modes of allelism (dominance, recessive). We show here, for the first time, a dominant (neomorphic) allele of a histone methyltransferase associated with a specific cancer.  Taken together, our data strongly suggest that EZH2Y641F/N variants in lymphoma act dominantly, through a mechanism that involves altered substrate catalytic specificity of the mutant EZH2 enzyme for its substrates. Our data show that, despite equimolar quantities of mutant and wild-type proteins in malignant cells, there is greater total H3K27me3 in mutant-bearing cell lines and primary tumors. Moreover, the EZH2Y641F/N variants have a strong dominant effect on H3K27me3 levels in cell lines that are wild-type for EZH2. They act in trans to provide a strong gain of function.  The probable mechanism is suggested by structural and enzymatic analysis of the EZH2Y641F/N variants. As shown in the cell-free assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, EZH2Y641F/N cannot carry out trimethylation of unmodified or monomethylated substrates (Figure 4)1 but still are able to form PRC2 complexes (Figure 2E) and increase the steady state of H3K27 trimethylation in vivo (Figure 2C-D). This means that it is probable that the gain of function of EZH2Y641 mutants would be to shift the monomethylated and/or dimethylated state of H3K27 to that of trimethylation (Figure 2D) on some bona fide EZH2 targets. It is clear that in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-histone H3K27me1 and anti-histone H3K27me3,28 that expression of EZH2Y641 mutants could shift the steady-state levels from H3K27me1 (which is correlated with gene activation) and H3K27me2 to H3K27me3, which is correlated with gene repression.29 Whether or not these EZH2Y641 mutants are able to catalyze higher order methylation on non-EZH2 (such as EZH130) targets remains an area of active investigation. The mechanism and the in vitro assays show that EZH2Y641F/N cannot catalyze monomethylation and dimethylation efficiently; therefore, the mutant protein is completely dependent on the presence of wild-type proteins for the gain-of-function effect. This requirement for a wild-type copy of EZH2 is highly analogous to the behavior of the Drosophila E(z)1 allele31,32; E(z)1 (homologous to EZH2Y641N) leads to a phenotypic gain of function and has been shown to act as a dominant repressor of E(z) target genes. However, the unique phenotype of the E(z)1 allele depends on the presence of the wild-type allele, and the E(z)1 enzyme appears to be inactive when assayed in vitro.32  It has been shown that overexpression of EZH2 is a feature of some cancers,2–4 whereas histone H3K27 demethylase UTX was found to be inactivated in other tumors.24,25 This would suggest that the increase in H3K27me3 levels may be achieved in cancer cells by redundant pathways induced by overexpression of EZH2 or inactivation of UTX. Our findings are consistent with this idea, as dominant EZH2Y641 mutations also increase the levels of H3K27me3 (Figure 5). It is currently unknown whether the gain of H3K27me3 in germinal center-derived B-cell lymphomas reflects an increase of methylation at normal PRC2 targets, or possibly a gain of methylation at noncanonical PRC2 targets. The significance of H3K27me3 may well be lineage/cell type dependent, and this will require future conditional alleles and lineage studies to dissect as well as improved efficiency of ChIP-seq methods in small cell populations. However, recent studies have emphasized that GCB lymphomas are dependent on EZH2 and that knockdown of EZH2 in GCB cell lines bearing Y641 mutations results in cell cycle arrest in germinal center B cells.33 Knockdown of EZH2 in this context results in increased expression of PRC2-regulated tumor suppressors. This is consistent with the physiologic roles of EZH2 in B-cell development and differentiation,34–36 although it should be noted that a full understanding of the PRC2 targets in B cells remains to be elucidated. Taken together with the present study, these support the notion that EZH2 is causally implicated.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Model depicting pathways to increase H3K27me3 levels that result in cancer. In this schematic diagram: solid arrow represents a direct effect; dotted arrow, multiple steps that lead to an effect. The observation of a dominant, gain-of-function mutation through altered catalytic preference in histone methyltransferases is unprecedented in cancer and carries important implications for drug development against EZH2. It is interesting to note that the substrate pockets of the mutant enzymes probably have a new, larger shape (smaller side chains of His, Asn, or Phe relative to wild-type Tyr), which potentially could be selectively targeted therapeutically in a strategy similar to that used to develop selective inhibitors of glycine gatekeeper mutants of protein kinases.37  
1084||EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, catalyzes the mono- through trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27). Histone H3K27 trimethylation is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification. Point mutations of the EZH2 gene (Tyr641) have been reported to be linked to subsets of human B-cell lymphoma. The mutant allele is always found associated with a wild-type allele (heterozygous) in disease cells, and the mutations were reported to ablate the enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex for methylating an unmodified peptide substrate. Here we demonstrate that the WT enzyme displays greatest catalytic efficiency (kcat/K) for the zero to monomethylation reaction of H3K27 and diminished efficiency for subsequent (mono- to di- and di- to trimethylation) reactions. In stark contrast, the disease-associated Y641 mutations display very limited ability to perform the first methylation reaction, but have enhanced catalytic efficiency for the subsequent reactions, relative to the WT enzyme. These results imply that the malignant phenotype of disease requires the combined activities of a H3K27 monomethylating enzyme (PRC2 containing WT EZH2 or EZH1) together with the mutant PRC2s for augmented conversion of H3K27 to the trimethylated form. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a human disease that is dependent on the coordinated activities of normal and disease-associated mutant enzymatic function.  Keywords: cancer, enzymology, epigenetics Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a 4 or 5 protein complex that functionally represses gene transcription via posttranslational modification of the chromatin core protein, histone H3. More specifically, PRC2 functions as a histone methyltransferase, catalyzing the selective methylation of lysine residue 27 on histone H3 (H3K27). EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, catalyzing the mono- through trimethylation of H3K27. Trimethylation of H3K27 is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification.  Recently, somatic mutations of Tyr641 (Y641F, Y641N, Y641S, and Y641H) of EZH2 were reported to be associated with follicular lymphoma (FL) and the germinal-center B-cell like (GCB) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (1). In all cases, occurrence of the mutant EZH2 gene was heterozygous, and expression of both WT and mutant alleles was detected in the mutant samples profiled by transcriptome sequencing. It was also demonstrated that all of the mutant forms of EZH2 could be incorporated into the multiprotein PRC2 complex, but that the resulting complexes lacked the ability to catalyze methylation of the H3K27 equivalent residue of a peptidic substrate. Hence, it was concluded that the disease-associated changes at Tyr641 resulted in loss of function with respect to EZH2-catalyzed H3K27 methylation.  A presumptive reduction in the rate of H3K27 methylation due to enzyme heterozygosity seemed to us to be difficult to rationalize as the basis for a malignant phenotype (1, 2), especially in light of previous data indicating that overexpression of EZH2 (3–6), loss-of-function mutations in the corresponding H3K27 demethylase UTX (7), or overexpression of components of the PRC2, such as PHF19/PCL3 involved in increased H3K27 trimethylation (8–10), all result in malignant phenotypes in specific human cancers. Several recent reports indicate that an important component of early lymphomagenesis is the acquisition of stem cell-like characteristics (11, 12). Among these characteristics is enriched DNA methylation of PRC2 target genes, resulting in diminished transcription of these genes (13). Trimethylation of H3K27, catalyzed by the enzymatic activity of EZH2, similarly leads to diminished transcription of these same genes and has thus been reported as an additional, potential progenitor of lymphomagenesis (11–14). EZH2 levels have also directly been implicated in lymphogenesis. For example, Velichutina et al. (14) found that EZH2 mRNA level was directly correlated with cellular proliferation in primary germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tumors, whereas levels of many EZH2 target genes were negatively correlated with proliferation in these same tumors. Likewise, expression levels of EZH2 and the PRC1 component BMI1 have both been linked to lymphogenesis and the degree of malignancy of B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas (15). We were thus motivated to explore the enzymology of the EZH2 mutants in greater detail.  Go to: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Recombinant PRC2 complexes (16) were prepared with WT and Tyr641 mutant versions of human EZH2 (see Materials and Methods). Equal concentrations (nominally 8 nM, based on protein determinations) of each complex were initially tested for the ability to catalyze 3H-methyl transfer from labeled SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) to an unmodified peptide representing the amino acid sequence surrounding H3K27 (H3:21-44) or to native avian erythrocyte oligonucleosomes. As previously reported (1), we found that the WT enzyme displayed robust activity for methyl transfer to this peptidic substrate, but that none of the mutant enzymes displayed significant methyltransferase activity (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the previously reported data and that in Fig. 1A, we found that all of the mutant EZH2 constructs were active methyltransferases against the avian nucleosome substrate (Fig. 1B).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. B-cell lymphoma-associated mutants of EZH2 are active histone methyltransferases. In vitro methyltransferase activity of PRC2 complexes containing wild-type and various Y641 mutants of EZH2 was measured as (A) methyl transfer reactions using a peptide ... There are several potential explanations for the discordant activity of the mutant PRC2 complexes on peptide and nucleosome substrates. One possibility is that substrate recognition sites distal to the enzyme active site (i.e., exosites) are important determinants of substrate binding and turnover; these sites would engage complementary recognition elements on the nucelosome that are not available on small peptidic substrates. However, when Escherichia coli-expressed, recombinant human histone H3 was tested as a substrate for the WT and mutant PRC2 complexes, the resulting pattern of activity was identical to that seen for the peptide substrate (see Supporting Information); that is, the WT enzyme demonstrated robust methyltransferase activity against the H3 substrate, the Y641F mutant showed 7% the activity of WT complex, and all other mutants displayed ≤ 1% the activity of WT complex. Hence, exosite engagement seems an unlikely explanation for the current results. The nucleosome presents many lysine residues beyond H3K27 as potential sites of methylation that would not be present in the small peptidic substrate. Thus, another possibility is that mutation of Y641 alters the substrate specificity of EZH2 to result in methylation of lysine residues other than H3K27. This possibility is unlikely given the excellent agreement between mutant activity on small peptide and recombinant H3 protein substrates. To evaluate this possibility further, we tested the enzymatic activity of the WT and mutant PRC2 complexes against a panel of peptidic substrates that represent all possible lysine residues of histone H3 and histone H4 (see Materials and Methods). All of the enzyme forms showed significant activity only against peptides containing the equivalent of residue H3K27. The specific activity of the mutants, however, was greatly reduced relative to WT in the order WT≫Y641F > Y641S ∼ Y641H > Y641N, again consistent with previous reported findings. The nucleosomes isolated from the avian natural source represent an admixture of states of histone modification, including various states of H3K27 methylations as judged by Western blotting with H3K27 methylation specific antibodies. Hence, another possibility is that the Y641 mutants of EZH2 display differential activity against different methylation states of H3K27.  To understand further the enzymatic activity of these mutants, and to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between activity against peptidic and nucleosome substrates, we studied the ability of the enzyme forms to catalyze further methylation of various H3K27 methylation states in the context of the H3:21-44 peptide. As stated above, we found that all of the mutant enzymes were deficient catalysts of unmodified H3K27 peptide methylation, relative to the WT enzyme. To our surprise, however, all of the mutant enzymes were superior to the WT enzyme in catalyzing further methylation of the mono- and especially the dimethylated H3K27 peptides (Fig. 2). Thus, the data suggest that the WT enzyme is most efficient in catalyzing the zero to monomethylation reaction. The mutant enzymes are defective in catalyzing this initial step, but are more efficient than the WT enzyme in catalyzing the subsequent steps leading from monomethyl to di- and trimethyl H3K27.  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. PRC2 complexes containing mutant EZH2 preferentially catalyze di- and trimethylation of histone H3K27. (A) Methyltransferase activity of mutant and WT complexes on unmethylated peptide (open bars), monomethylated peptide (hatched bars), and dimethylated ... The origins of the differential substrate specificities of WT and mutant EZH2 were explored through steady-state enzyme kinetics. As summarized in Table 1, the mutations have minimal effects on ground-state substrate recognition, as demonstrated by the similar values of Km for nucleosome and of K1/2 for peptide substrates. In all cases the peptidic substrates displayed sigmoidal binding behavior; hence, the concentration of peptide resulting in half-maximal velocity is reported here as K1/2 instead of the more common Michaelis constant, Km (17). This sigmoidal behavior was seen only with peptidic substrates (i.e., nucleosome and recombinant histone substrates displayed classical Michaelis–Menten kinetics), and the origin of this effect is unclear at present. The SAM Km likewise displayed minimal variation among the enzyme forms, ranging from 208 ± 50 to 304 ± 64 nM. Instead, the differences in substrate utilization appear to have their origin in transition state recognition, as demonstrated by differences in kcat values among the enzymes for various substrates (Table 1); as a result, the catalytic efficiency, quantified as the ratio kcat/K (where K is either Km or K1/2, depending on substrate identity; see above), varies between the WT and mutant enzymes for different states of H3K27 methylation (Table 1).  Table 1. Table 1. Steady-state kinetic parameters for methylation reactions catalyzed by PRC2 containing wild-type or Y641 mutants of EZH2 The mutation of Y641 to F, N, H, or S in EZH2 may facilitate multiple rounds of H3K27 methylation by impacting the H-bonding pattern and/or steric crowding in the active site of the enzyme–bisubstrate ternary complex, affecting the formation of a proper water channel for deprotonation of the reacting lysine (18). This inference is drawn by analogy to the crystallographic and molecular dynamic simulation results seen for tyrosine mutation in the related protein lysine methyltransferases LSMT, Dim-5, and SET7/9. For example, when tyrosine 245 of recombinant SET7/9 was mutated to alanine, a change in substrate specificity, similar to what is reported here for EZH2 Y641 mutations, was observed (19). The ability of the Y245A mutant SET7/9 to methylate an unmodified 20-residue peptide, representing the sequence surrounding H3K4, was reduced to ca. 20% of the WT enzyme (20). At the same time, the ability of the Y245A mutant to further methylate H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 peptides was greatly augmented (ca. 7-fold and 5-fold, respectively) relative to the WT enzyme. In contrast to the present results, however, mutation of SET7/9 Y245 to phenylalanine did not enhance mono- to dimethylation nor di- to trimethylation of the peptide; rather, the Y245F mutant displayed minimal catalytic activity for all peptidic substrates. Similarly, the wild-type enzyme G9a can dimethylate H3K9 but is unable to perform the di- to trimethylation reaction. Yet, when tyrosine 1067 of G9a (analogous to Y641 of EZH2) is mutated to phenylalanine, the enzyme now gains the ability to trimethylate H3K9 (21). The tolerance for multiple Y641 mutations in EZH2 suggests that a release of steric crowding may allow greater access for proper alignment of the larger dimethyl lysine as the substrate for the di- to trimethylation reaction. Crystallographic analysis of the protein methyltransferases SET7/9 and G9a reveals that the side chain hydroxyls of the active site tyrosine residues are involved in H-bonding interactions directly with the amine of the methyl-accepting lysine, or indirectly through an intervening water molecule. Although the larger active site of the Y641 mutants is favorable for di- and trimethylation, the loss of the tyrosine hydroxyl hydrogen bond acceptor may result in an unfavorable orientation of the active site for initial methyl transfer to the lysine amine. A complete understanding of the molecular basis for the dramatic reduction in the ability of these mutant enzymes to perform the initial methylation reaction will require additional study.  The implications of the present results for human disease are made clear by the data summarized in Table 1. Cells heterozygous for EZH2 would be expected to display a malignant phenotype, due to the efficient formation of H3K27me1 by the WT enzyme and the efficient, subsequent transition of this progenitor species to abnormally high levels of H3K27me3 by the mutant enzyme form(s). We note that H3K27me1 formation is not exclusively dependent on WT-EZH2 catalysis. Knockout studies of EZH2 and of another PRC2 subunit, EED, have demonstrated H3K27me1 formation can be catalyzed by PRC2 complexes containing either EZH2 or the related protein EZH1, as the catalytic subunit (22). Hence, catalytic coupling between the mutant EZH2 species and PRC2 complexes containing either WT-EZH2 or WT-EZH1 would suffice to augment H3K27me3 formation and thus produce the attendant malignant phenotype. Our data therefore suggest that the malignant phenotype of FL and DLBCL of the GCB subtype, associated with expression of mutant forms of EZH2 (1), is the result of an overall gain of function with respect to formation of the trimethylated form of H3K27.  The steady-state kinetic parameters listed in Table 1 allow us to calculate the expected levels of different H3K27 methylation states for cells heterozygous for the various mutant EZH2 forms, relative to cells homozygous for the WT enzyme. To perform these simulations we made a number of simplifying assumptions: (i) that steady-state enzyme kinetics are relevant to PRC2-catalyzed H3K27 methylation in the cellular context and that all measurements are made at the same time point in cell growth; (ii) that the mutant and the WT enzyme are expressed at equal levels in heterozygous cells and that the total EZH2 level is equal in all cells; (iii) that the cellular concentration of SAM, relative to its Km, is saturating and does not change among the cells; (iv) that the cellular concentration of nucleosome is similar to its Km and likewise does not change among cells; (v) that EZH1 catalyzed methylation of H3K27 was insignificant and constant among the cells; and (vi) that any H3K27 demethylase activity was also constant among the cells. With these assumptions in place, we obtained the predictions illustrated in Fig. 3A for relative levels of H3K27me3 (Top), H3K27me2 (Middle), and H3K27me1 (Bottom). A clear pattern emerges from these simulations. The level of H3K27me3 increases relative to WT cells for all mutant-harboring cells, ranging from a 30% increase for the Y641H mutant to > 400% for the Y641N mutant. At the same time, the levels of H3K27me2 decrease to < 50% of WT for all of the mutants, and the levels of H3K27me1 are reduced by approximately half for all mutants, relative to WT. We then measured the relative levels of the H3K27 methylation states in B-cell lymphoma cell lines that are known to be homozygous for WT EZH2 (OCI-LY19) or heterozygous for EZH2 Y641N (DB, KARPAS 422, and SU-DHL-6) or EZH2 Y641F (WSU-DLCL2) by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). The pattern of relative H3K27 methylation states seen in Fig. 3B is in excellent agreement with the results of the simulations based on in vitro steady-state kinetic parameters, despite the crude assumptions used in the simulations and the use of a nonphysiological peptide surrogate as substrate. Thus, we observe increased H3K27me3 for all mutant-harboring cells relative to WT, decreased H3K27me2 for all mutant-harboring cells relative to WT, and decreased H3K27me1 for at least two of the four mutant cell lines. The near-comparable levels of H3K27me1 in WT and KARPAS 422 and SU-DHL-6 cells may reflect different expression levels of WT and mutant EZH2, different contributions of EZH1, or other factors not accounted for in our simulations. Nevertheless, the concordance between the predicted and experimental patterns of H3K27 methylation status is remarkable and supports our view that enzymatic coupling between WT and mutant EZH2 leads to increased H3K27me3, thus resulting in the malignant phenotype of cells that are heterozygous for these mutants.  Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Steady-state enzyme kinetics predicts the relative patterns of H3K27 methylation status in EZH2 WT and heterozygous mutant lymphoma cell lines. (A) Predicted relative levels of H3K27me3 (Top), H3K27me2 (Middle), and H3K27me1 (Bottom) for cells containing ... The foregoing interpretation of our data also helps to reconcile the existence of cancer-associated overexpression of EZH2 (3–6) or PRC2-associated proteins (e.g., PHF19/PCL3) (8–10) and also loss-of-function genotypes for the histone H3K27 demethylase UTX (7). Loss of UTX activity would be enzymatically equivalent to a gain of function for EZH2, in either situation resulting in greater steady-state levels of trimethylated H3K27 in cancer cells (Fig. 4). The mono-, di-, and trimethylation states of histone H3K27 are associated with different functions in transcriptional control. Histone H3K27 monomethylation is associated with active transcription of genes that are poised for transcription (23, 24). In contrast, trimethylation of histone H3K27 is associated with either transcriptionally repressed genes (23, 25) or genes that are poised for transcription when histone H3K4 trimethylation is in cis (26). Taken together, alterations in the PRC2 complex activity reported in cancer, including the Y641 mutation of EZH2, are predicted to result in an increase in the trimethylated state of histone H3K27 and to thus result in transcriptional repression.  Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Proposed mechanisms leading to aberrantly high levels of trimethylation on histone H3K27 in cancer include (A) mutation of Y641 in EZH2 resulting in a change in substrate preference from the nonmethylated to the mono- and dimethylated histone H3K27, ( ... EZH2 and other protein methyltransferases have been suggested to be attractive targets for drug discovery (27–29). The present data also suggest an experimental strategy for development of FL and GCB lymphoma-specific drugs. As the differences in substrate recognition between the WT and disease-associated mutants derive from transition state interactions, small molecule inhibitors that selectively mimic the transition state of the mutant EZH2 over that of the WT enzyme should prove to be effective in blocking H3K27 methylation in mutation-bearing cells. Inhibitors of this type would be expected to display a large therapeutic index, as target-mediated toxicity would be minimal for any cells bearing only the WT enzyme. Transition state mimicry has proved to be an effective strategy for drug design in many disease areas (17, 30). Whether or not sufficient differentiation between the transition states of the WT and mutant EZH2 enzymes can be designed into a small molecule drug remains to be determined.  In summary, the present results point to a critical dependency on enzymatic coupling between enzymes that perform H3K27 monomethylation and the mutant forms of EZH2, for pathogenesis in FL and the GCB subtype of DLBCL. This is an example of a human disease that is dependent on such coupling of catalytic activity between normal (H3K27me1) and disease-associated mutant (H3K27me2/3) enzymes. We are unaware of other examples of this mechanism of pathogenesis in human disease.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Recombinant 5-Component PRC2. Wild-type EZH2 (NM_004456) or Tyr641 mutants were coexpressed with wild-type AEBP2 (NM_153207), EED (NM_003797), SUZ12 (NM_015355), and RbAp48 (NM_005610) in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using a baculovirus expression system. An N-terminal FLAG tag on the EED was used to purify active PRC2 complex from cell lysates (BPS Bioscience, catalog number 51004). The purity of the final PRC2 preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining.  Recombinant Human Histone H3. Recombinant human histone H3.1, expressed in and purified from E. coli (catalog number M250S) was purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc.  H3, H4 Peptide Panel. A library consisting of 44 peptides of 15 amino acids each was synthesized by 21st Century Biochemicals. This peptide panel encompassed all of the amino acids of human histones H3 and H4 with 10 residue overlaps between consecutive peptide sequences. The N terminus of each peptide was appended with biotin, and the C termini were represented as the amide. Purity (> 95%) and identity were confirmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectral analysis.  For study of the H3K27 methylation status dependence of enzyme activity, peptides were synthesized representing the amino acid sequence of human H3 from residues 21–44 (H3:21–44) with lysine 27 represented as the unmodified, monomethylated, dimethylated, or trimethylated side chain amine. These peptides were purchased from New England Peptide with biotin appended to the C terminus of each peptide.  In Vitro Assays of PRC2 Methyltransferase Activity. Flashplate assay with peptide substrate. For initial comparison of WT and Y641 mutants of EZH2, biotinylated histone H3:21-44 peptide containing unmethylated K27 (New England Peptide), monomethylated K27 (Millipore), or dimethylated K27 (Millipore) at a concentration of 800 nM was combined with a mixture of SAM at 1,700 nM, and 300 nM tritiated SAM (PerkinElmer, Inc.). This substrate combination was then added to the PRC2 in assay buffer [20 mM N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine (Bicine), 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween20, 0.005% bovine skin gelatin (BSG), pH 7.6]. Reactions were allowed to proceed for the indicated time interval and then quenched by addition of excess cold SAM (600-μM final concentration). Quenched reaction mixtures were transferred to a streptavidin-coated Flashplate (PerkinElmer, catalog number SMP410), allowed to bind for 1 h, and then detected on a TopCount NXT HTS (PerkinElmer). Each time point represents the average of six individual reactions. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined under identical reaction conditions except that the concentration of peptide or SAM was varied, while at saturating conditions of the other substrate. Velocity was plotted as a function of varied substrate concentration and the data were fitted to the untransformed version of the Michaelis–Menten equation or the untransformed version of a sigmoidal kinetic equation (30) to calculate values of K and kcat (30). Standard errors of fitted parameters are listed in Table 1 and were used to construct the error bars illustrated in Fig. 2 B and C. Errors associated with kcat/K (Table 1) were calculated according to standard methods of error propogation; the fractional error of kcat/K was determined as  equation image	[1] where μkcat is the standard error of kcat and μK is the standard error of K.  Filterplate assay with histone and oligonucleosome. Chicken erythrocyte oligonucleosomes were purified as previously described (31). Nucleosomes or histones were combined with a mixture of SAM and tritiated SAM and added to PRC2 in assay buffer (20 mM Bicine, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween20, 0.005% BSG, pH 7.6). Reactions were run and quenched as above. Quenched reaction mixture was transferred to a glass fiber filterplate (Millipore, catalog number MSFBN6B) and washed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid and allowed to dry. Microscint Zero (30 μL) was added and tritium incorporation was detected on a TopCount. Steady-state parameters for reactions with nucelosomes were determined under identical reaction conditions except that the concentration of nucleosome or SAM was varied while at saturating conditions of the other substrate. Velocity was plotted as a function of varied substrate concentration and fitted to the untransformed version of the Michaelis–Menten equation to derive the values of Km and kcat as described above.  Evaluation of H3K27 methylation status in cells. The cell lines OCI-LY19 (ACC 528), KARPAS-422 (ACC 32), and WSU-DLCL2 (ACC 575) were obtained from DSMZ. The cell lines DB (CRL-2289) and SU-DHL2 (CRL-2959) were obtained from ATCC. OCI-LY19, WSU-DLCL2, and DB cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, and KARPAS-422 and SU-DHL2 cell lines were grown in RPMI medium 1640 plus 20% FBS. Cells were grown to a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/mL and 1 × 107 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 264  × g, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed by resuspension in a 10× pellet volume of RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, and 1mM EDTA (Millipore #20-188), plus 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche # 1836153). Lysates were sonicated by two rounds of ten 1-s bursts at setting 3 with a Misonix XL-2000 to ensure efficient histone extraction, and cleared by centrifugation at 4° using a bench top centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Four micrograms of each lysate was fractionated on 4–20% Tris-Glycine gel (Invitrogen), transferred to PVDF, and probed with the following antibodies in Odyssey blocking buffer: mouse anti-EZH2 (CST 3147; 1∶2,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (CST 9733; 1∶10,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me2 (CST 9755; 1∶5,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me1 (Active Motif 39377; 1∶5,000 dilution), and mouse antiTotal H3 (CST 3638; 1∶20,000 dilution). Following primary Ab incubation, membranes were probed with IRDye 800CW donkey-anti-mouse IgG (LiCOR #926-32212) or Alexa Fluor 680 goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen #A-21076) secondary Ab and imaged using the LiCOR Odyssey system.  Next-generation sequencing of follicular lymphoma and diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma has revealed frequent somatic, heterozygous Y641 mutations in the histone methyltransferase EZH2. Heterozygosity and the presence of equal quantities of both mutant and wild-type mRNA and expressed protein suggest a dominant mode of action. Surprisingly, B-cell lymphoma cell lines and lymphoma samples harboring heterozygous EZH2Y641 mutations have increased levels of histone H3 Lys-27–specific trimethylation (H3K27me3). Expression of EZH2Y641F/N mutants in cells with EZH2WT resulted in an increase of H3K27me3 levels in vivo. Structural modeling of EZH2Y641 mutants suggests a “Tyr/Phe switch” model whereby structurally neutral, nontyrosine residues at position 641 would decrease affinity for unmethylated and monomethylated H3K27 substrates and potentially favor trimethylation. We demonstrate, using in vitro enzyme assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, that Y641 mutations result in a decrease in monomethylation and an increase in trimethylation activity of the enzyme relative to the wild-type enzyme. This represents the first example of a disease-associated gain-of-function mutation in a histone methyltransferase, whereby somatic EZH2 Y641 mutations in lymphoma act dominantly to increase, rather than decrease, histone methylation. The dominant mode of action suggests that allele-specific EZH2 inhibitors should be a future therapeutic strategy for this disease.  Go to: Introduction Non-Hodgkin lymphomas represent a diverse spectrum of distinct entities with the 2 most common types represented by follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). There are 2 molecular subtypes of DLBCL based on cell-of-origin distinctions: the activated B-cell type and the germinal center B-cell (GCB) type. Both follicular lymphoma and the GCB subtype of DLBCL derive from germinal center B cells. We have shown that, in 7% of follicular lymphomas and 22% of GCB-type DLBCL, a single point mutation in EZH2, which results in a single amino-acid change at position 641, is selected for; EZH2 (Tyr641 or WT) was mutated to phenylalanine (Y641F), asparagine (Y641N), histidine (Y641H), or serine (Y641S).1 EZH2 has been implicated as an oncoprotein often overexpressed in many solid tumors.2–4 Initial analysis of the activity of Y641 variants in cell-free reconstituted Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) complexes using unmethylated peptides suggested that the mutations behaved as a loss of function.1  EZH2 is the catalytic member of the PRC2; however, EZH2 alone has very weak histone-methylating activity. Other members of the PRC2 complex include EED, SUZ12, AEBP2, and RbAp48 and are required for full activity. The PRC2 complex has been shown to exhibit in vitro enzyme activity on histone peptide substrates and nucleosomes. EZH2 is a member of the Su(var)3,9, enhancer of zest, Trithorax (SET) domain containing family of histone methyltransferases (HMTases); all contain a conserved SET domain. Genetic and biochemical analysis of EZH2 SET domain has revealed their histone methyltransferase function associated with histone H3 Lys-27–specific trimethylation (H3K27me3) in vivo. Recently, a structural basis for the allosteric modulation of EZH2 activity by EED has been elucidated.5  Structural and biochemical data from other SET domain HMTases have shed light not only on the molecular mechanism of histone methylation but also the specific residues of the conserved SET domain responsible for these reactions. For example, all active HMTases contain a catalytic triad—the asparagine-histidine-serine (NHS) motif,6 and mutation of any one of these residues in the active site abolishes the activity of the enzyme. Studies have also implicated residues important for the binding of the S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)7 and for recognition of the amino-acid sequence of the histone peptide tail.8 However, these studies have not shed light on the role of the highly evolutionarily conserved Tyr 641 of EZH2.  Through the use of molecular modeling and recently published molecular and biochemical data from an allelic series of G9a9 and by analogy to the “Tyr/Phe” switch alleles in other methyltransferases,10,11 we show that Tyr 641 of EZH2 is implicated in substrate and product specificity. Taken together with the finding that DLBCL cell lines heterozygous for EZH2 mutants exhibit higher steady-state levels of H3K27me3 and in vitro enzyme studies, a possible mechanism may be proposed. This report provides evidence that EZH2 Y641 mutant protein-containing PRC2 complexes exhibit increased activity on dimethylated peptides compared with wild-type containing PRC2 complexes, thereby shifting the steady state of H3K27 to favor trimethylation in vivo. As previously described, the EZH2 mutant-containing PRC2 complexes are inactive on unmethylated histone peptides,1 implying that the Y641F/N mutations can only act in the presence of a wild-type EZH2.  Go to: Methods Reagents  Antibodies. Rabbit polyclonal anti-histone H3 (ab1791), anti-histone H3K9me3 (ab8898), anti-histone H4K20me3 (ab9053), anti-EED (ab4469), and mouse monoclonal anti-histone H3K27me3 (ab6002) were purchased from Abcam. Rabbit polyclonal anti-histone H3K27me1 (07-448) and anti-histone H3K27me2 (05-821), anti-SUZ12 (ab12073), and mouse monoclonal anti-histone H3K27me3 (07-449) and anti-SUZ12 (04-046) were purchased from Millipore; the specificity of methyl-specific anti-histone H3K27 antibodies was tested using H3K27 methylated peptides (supplemental Figure 3, available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). Mouse monoclonal anti-EZH2 (612667) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Mouse monoclonal anti-Flag M2 (F1804) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and mouse monoclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP; MMS-118P) was from Covance Research Products. Antibiotin was from Cell Signaling Technology, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was from RDI Division of Fitzgerald Industries International.  Plasmids. pDONR223 human EZH2 was from the human ORFeome collection.12 Point mutations were made to generate EZH2Y641F and EZH2Y641N. These ORFs were then transferred into pcDNA6.2 GFP-V5 (Invitrogen) using the LR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmids containing mouse Ezh2, pCMV FLAG-Ezh2WT, and FLAG-Ezh2H689A were gifts from D. Reinberg (New York University, New York, NY).13 Plasmid inserts were fully sequenced to confirm their identity. For viral vectors, mutant constructs were generated using site-directed mutagenesis of the RefSeq EZH2 (NM_004456) as previously described.14 For transfer into a retroviral vector system, EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified, A-tailed using Taq polymerase, and cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen) from where it was transferred into a Gateway-adapted version of pSF9114 upstream of the internal ribosomal entry site and the enhanced GFP gene. As a control, the pSF91 vector carrying only the internal ribosomal entry site-enhanced GFP cassette was used. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Generation of recombinant ecotropic retrovirus-producing GP + E86 cells was performed as previously described.15  Primers  Primers include the following: EZH2-HA fw N-terminal MluI, gagagaacgcgtaaccatgtacccatacgacgtcccagactacgctatgggccagactgggaag; EZH2-HA fw N-terminal MfeI, gagagacaattgaaccatgtacccatacgacgtcccagactacgctatgggccagactgggaag; and EZH2-HA rev, gagagagtcgactcaagggatttccatttctcttt.  Peptides. Biotinylated peptides, H3 (1-21) (#12-403), H3 (21-44) (#12-404), H3(21-44)K27(me1) (#12-567), H3(21-44)K27(me2) (#12-566), and H3(21-44)K27(me3) (#12-565), were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The purity for each peptide was assessed using mass spectrometry to be more than 95% (data not shown) and identity confirmed by dot blotting (supplemental Figure 3).  Clinical samples. Snap-frozen initial diagnostic lymph node biopsies with a confirmed diagnosis of DLBCL were studied. In total, 10 cases were analyzed by Western blotting, including 5 cases with confirmed wild-type EZH2 and 5 mutant cases. All cases were identified by whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing, and the DNA status then confirmed by Sanger sequencing.9 Informed consent for these studies was obtained for all patients together with research ethics approval in accordance with the British Columbia Cancer Agency policy and the Declaration of Helsinki.  Cell lines and transfection  DLBCL cell lines harboring EZH2WT or heterozygous for EZH2Y641F or EZH2Y641N (imported from the DSMZ; www.dsmz.de) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells (150 000 cells per well of a 6-well plate) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or TransIT−LT1 (Mirus) with 1 to 5 μg of plasmids. Stable cell lines were made by transfection of HEK293T cells with the respective plasmids and then selection with blasticidine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 week. Pools of stable lines expressing GFP-alone or GFP-tagged proteins were used for the experiments.  Western blotting and immunoprecipitation  Standard methods of Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were used; details are in the supplemental data. Densitometry measurements of bands were used to calculate H3K27me3/totalH3 by integrating each peak in ImageJ (1.44n, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij) software.  Large-scale immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry  A total of 3 × 108 cells from the WSU-DLCL2 and DOHH2 cell lines were harvested, and nuclear lysates were prepared as described in the supplemental data. For large-scale immunoprecipitations, 160 mg of nuclear lysates was diluted with binding buffer and precleared with Sepharose 4B for 1 hour at 4°C. EZH2 complexes were immunoprecipitated with 30 μg of anti-EZH2 antibody (#612667, BD Biosciences) by rotating overnight at 4°C. Antibody-bound protein complexes were then incubated with 120 μL of Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 4°C. Bound EZH2 complexes were washed 5 times with 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 30 μL of sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading dye. Samples were resolved using a 4% to 12% gradient gel (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and stained with colloidal Coomassie stain. After destaining, the gel was cut into 16 slices per lane corresponding to a specific molecular weight range. In-gel trypsin digestion was performed, and peptides were extracted from the gel using standard protocols.16  High-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry (MS) was performed on a 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/Sciex) coupled to an Agilent 1100 Nano-HPLC (Agilent Technologies) using a nano-electrospray interface, as described in supplemental data.  Histone methyltransferase assay  Similar batches of recombinant reconstituted active PRC2 complexes as used previously1 containing EZH2WT(51 004), EZH2Y641N, or EZH2Y641F were purchased from BPS Biosciences. Methyltransferase assays were performed using a kit (#17-330, Millipore) as per the manufacturer's instructions, except that biotinylated peptides were used as substrates; 250 ng of active PRC2 complex was incubated with 0.67μM 3H-SAM (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences), 1μM biotinylated peptide in 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 0.5mM dithiothreitol for 30 minutes at 30°C in a 10-μL volume. A total of 5 μL was spotted on a P81 square paper (Millipore), washed (twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid and once with 100% ethanol) to remove unincorporated SAM, air-dried, and placed in a glass scintillation vial with 5 mL of scintillation fluid (ScintiSafe Econo1, Fisher Chemical) and counted on a 1900TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).  Modeling  A model of the EZH2 core catalytic domain lining the substrate lysine binding channel was built by homology to the G9a/EHMT2 structure (PDB code 2o8j), based on the alignment shown in supplemental Figure 6 and supplemental Figure 8. The EZH2 sequence was threaded onto the G9a backbone, and when homologous, G9a side chains were used as a template to position EZH2 residues, according to the “minimize tethers” command using ICM, Version 3.6-1g (Molsoft LLC17).  Retroviral infection and B-cell in vitro differentiation assay  Parental strain mice were bred and maintained as approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. Primary mouse bone marrow cells were transduced as previously described with minor modifications.18 Details are in the supplemental data.  Go to: Results EZH2Y641F/N proteins are expressed approximately 1:1 with wild-type EZH2 in DLBCL cell lines  Conspicuously, the EZH2 mutations identified in GCB lymphomas are all located in exon 15 of EZH2, and all are missense mutations that change a single highly evolutionarily conserved tyrosine residue in the catalytic SET domain (Tyr641 or WT) to phenylalanine (Y641F), asparagine (Y641N), histidine (Y641H), or serine (Y641S).1 This recurrent pattern of a heterozygous somatic mutation in a functionally conserved region, affecting a single residue, is highly suggestive of a gain of dominant mode of action, either dominant negative or a gain-of-function/neomorph. Both wild-type (EZH2WT) and EZH2Y641 variant transcripts could be observed in lymphoma-derived cell lines (Y641N: DB, Karpas 422, SU-DHL-6, and Y641F: WSU-DLCL-2) bearing the mutations (supplemental Figure 1). Potentially, the mutations at EZH2Y641 could alter the stability of the protein. To investigate this possibility, we developed a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode MS signature for tryptic peptides covering the mutated region of EZH2 (wild-type, MutF) and a common region from tandem MS spectra of recombinant EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F (Figure 1A; supplemental Figure 2A-B) and used this to estimate the abundance of mutant EZH2 in malignant cells. To determine the amount of mutant EZH2 in a DLCBL cell line, we immunoprecipitated total endogenous EZH2 from nuclear lysates of the WSU-DLCL2 cell line (EZH2Y641F) and the DOHH2 cell line (EZH2WT) from 2 independent experiments. Gel electrophoresis fractions of the immunoprecipitates encompassing the size of EZH2 were analyzed for the peptides by MRM-MS. Signals for the wild-type, MutF, and common peptides were observed in the WSU-DLCL2 cell line, whereas only wild-type and common signals were observed in the DOHH2 cell line (Figure 1B; supplemental Figure 2C; and data not shown), demonstrating that both EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F proteins were present in the WSU-DLCL2 cell line. The wild-type/MutF peak area ratios were compared with the wild-type/MutF peak area ratios of an external standard curve of mixtures of recombinant EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F (Figure 1C). The percentage EZH2WT was calculated from an equation fit to the standard curve. The comparison indicated that there was a 40:60 EZH2WT/EZH2Y641F protein ratio in the WSU-DLCL2 sample (Figure 1C; supplemental Figure 2C); thus, approximately equal quantities of mutant EZH2 protein are present, showing that the mutations do not adversely affect the stability of the protein in vivo and therefore that any differences in activity should not be explained by a highly skewed ratio of wild-type and mutant proteins alone.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Quantitation of EZH2 wild-type and EZH2 Y641F (MutF) protein expression by mass spectrometry. (A) Tandem MS spectra of recombinant EZH2 wild-type and MutF peptides (residues 635-654) used in the MRM assay. Peptide fragments (y and b ions) identified are ... EZH2Y641 mutation bearing B-cell lymphoma cell lines and GCB lymphoma containing tissues exhibit higher levels of H3K27me3 than wild-type  Initial studies1 of EZH2Y641F/N cell-free, reconstituted PRC2 complexes showed that the mutant EZH2-containing PRC2 complexes had 7-fold less activity in converting unmethylated H3K27 target peptides, compared with wild-type. This would suggest that mutation-bearing cell lines and tumors should have globally reduced H3K27me3 levels. A direct comparison is complicated by the nonisogenic status of the cell lines and, in the case of primary tumor material, by variable tumor cellularity. Nevertheless, we measured H3K27me3 (with 2 different H3K27me3 antibodies, verified for monospecificity; see “Western blotting and immunoprecipitation”; supplemental Figure 3) with respect to total H3, in a series of GCB-derived lymphoma cell lines, sequenced to determine the presence or absence of Y641 mutations. Unexpectedly, we found that EZH2Y641F/N bearing cell lines (Figure 2A,G) and tumors (Figure 2B,H) generally exhibited greater levels of H3K27me3 than wild-type cases, suggesting hyperactivity of the PRC2 complexes.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Y641 mutations in B-cell lines and tumors increase steady state of H3K27me3. (A) Steady-state H3K27me3 levels in DLBCL. Nuclear lysates from DLCBCLs with either wild-type EZH2 (Pfeiffer, MD903, NU-DHL-1, NU-DUL-1, DOHH2, and Toledo) or heterozygous for ... EZH2Y641F/N mutants act dominantly in HEK293T and in vitro differentiated B cells to increase H3K27me3 levels  The first 2 sets of observations strongly suggested that EZH2Y641F/N mutants could act dominantly in cells to increase H3K27me3. To test this idea, we expressed wild-type and EZH2Y641F/N proteins in HEK293T cells (wild-type for EZH2) and measured the effect on total H3K27me3 levels. Both stable and transient expression of EZH2Y641F/N mutant proteins in a wild-type context (HEK293T cells) results in a significant increase in H3K27me3 (Figure 2C; supplemental Figure 4), whereas wild-type EZH2 or the methyltransferase dead EZH2H689A,19 expressed in the same cell types results in a barely detectable increase in H3K27me3 (Figure 2D). Notably, the increase in the steady-state levels of H3K27me3 occurred, even though stable expression of GFP-EZH2Y641 protein was lower compared with endogenous EZH2 (Figure 2C upper band). To show that GFP-EZH2 was expressed as part of the PRC2,13 we immunoprecipitated GFP-tagged EZH2 and probed with EZH2, EED, or SUZ12. As shown in Figure 2E, mutant EZH2 was able to coprecipitate with other members of the PRC2 complex. EZH2Y641 mutants thus shifted the in vivo equilibrium levels of H3K27 methylation from monomethylation and dimethylation to predominantly trimethylation (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the cell lines bearing EZH2Y641F/N mutations are also uniformly and markedly more resistant (supplemental Figure 5) to 3-deazaneplanocin A, a global small-molecule inhibitor of single-carbon transfer methyltransferases, which has been reported as a nonspecific inhibitor of EZH2 activity20,21 (specific inhibitors have yet to be described). Finally, we asked whether Y641 variants were capable of conferring a gain of H3K27me3 on B-cell lineages in the mouse. Primary murine primary bone marrow cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing GFP and either wild-type EZH2 or EZH2Y641F and differentiated into the B-cell lineage in the presence of IL7 and FLT3-L. Measurement of total H3K27me3 again showed increased H3K27me3 (Figure 2F) in cells bearing EZH2Y641F, whereas EZH2WT constructs did not confer this phenotype (Figure 2F).  Structural modeling suggests that Tyr 641 residue may be involved in product equilibrium  We sought to understand why EZH2Y641F/N variants act dominantly through a structural analysis of this region in EZH2. Scanning mutagenesis and solved structures have provided insights into regions governing substrate preferences and specificity of several methytransferases; however, a fully solved structure of the EZH2 protein is not currently available. We therefore undertook structural homology modeling of the catalytic core region of EZH2 on the high resolution crystal structures of the lysine dimethyltransferase, G9a, and the lysine monomethyltransferase, SETD7 for which there are also detailed enzymatic data9,10 (Figure 3; supplemental Figures 6-8). Y641 of EZH2 aligns with Y1067 in G9a, which when mutated to Phe was recently shown to convert G9a into a trimethyltransferase with a concomitant decrease in monomethylation and dimethylation activity.9 Similarly, the analogous residue in SETD7 (Y245) can also confer trimethyltransferase activity on SETD7 when mutated to Ala.10 The structures reveal that Tyr in this position forms a hydrogen bond with the substrate lysine amino nitrogen moiety and keeps one of its lone pair electrons oriented away from the SAM methyl donor (Figure 3 black arrow). Thus, this Tyr residue “ties up” the face of the recipient lysyl nitrogen to which the third methyl would otherwise be transferred. This Tyr-substrate hydrogen bond also contributes to the preferred binding affinity of the enzyme for monomethylated and unmethylated substrates as evidenced by the weaker Km values of the Y1067F G9a mutants for unmethylated and monomethylated substrates.9 Furthermore, the Km of G9a Y1067F for dimethylated substrate reflects a stronger affinity for H3K27me2 than for monomethylated or unmethylated substrates.9 In the trimethyltransferases, such as EZH2, this tyrosine residue is also conserved, probably facilitating the first 2 methyl transfer reactions. Because the active sites of EZH2WT can also accommodate a third methyl group, it has probably evolved a compromise between monomethylation, dimethylation, and trimethylation (relative to G9a, for example), perhaps via small structural adjustments that allow it to carry out trimethylation, even in the presence of the Y641 residue. Thus, mutation of Y641 in EZH2 to residues, such as Phe (F) or Asn (N), which do not disturb the structure, can be predicted to abrogate the affinity for unmethylated or monomethylated lysine substrates while at the same time reducing steric crowding in the active site, thereby potentially facilitating the catalytic efficiency for trimethylation.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Homology model of the active site of EZH2. The model is based on sequence and structure alignment with histone dimethyltransferase G9a/EHMT2 (PDBID 2O8J).9 This was also structurally aligned with GLP/EHMT1 bound to an H3K9me2 peptide substrate (PDBID ... Mutations of these tyrosine residues (analogous to Y641 in EZH2) result in a shift of product equilibrium to favor the trimethylated state. The structural and functional basis of the substitution of Tyr to smaller residues, particularly Phe, is known as the Tyr/Phe switch.11,22 Although the Tyr/Phe switch has been described at other residues from scanning mutagenesis in vitro, this is the first example of a disease-associated Tyr/Phe switch.  EZH2Y641-containing PRC2 complexes show increased substrate preference for dimethylated peptide in vitro  To test the structural hypothesis that EZH2Y641 mutations have a reduced ability to methylate H3K27me0/1 substrates but increased ability to methylate H3K27me2 substrates, we next studied the function of the enzyme in vitro. Because the relative catalytic efficiency of the EZH2/PRC2 complex for each methyl addition step is poorly understood, we carried out a 3H methyl incorporation assay using recombinant PRC2 complexes,23 containing EED, SUZ12, AEBP2, RbAp48, and wild-type or EZH2Y641 mutants, as previously described.1 We assayed the activity of the variant proteins by measuring 3H-methyl incorporation, using unmodified, chemically synthesized monomethylated and dimethylated K27 substrate peptides, in preference to nucleosomes because the latter contain endogenous histone modifications (supplemental Figure 3) that make nucleosome assays difficult to interpret (supplemental Figure 9). Strikingly, EZH2Y641 mutants showed (Figure 4) strongly reduced activity on unmethylated or monomethylated peptides but markedly enhanced activity on dimethylated peptides compared with EZH2 wild-type containing PRC2 complexes. We estimated the specific activity of the protein complexes (Table 1) and observed that the EZH2Y641F/N containing PRC2 complexes are approximately twice as active on dimethylated peptides compared with wild-type. These data indicate that EZH2Y641F/N mutations alter the substrate specificity, as suggested by the structural model, in favor of dimethylated peptides compared with PRC2 containing complexes with only wild-type EZH2.  Figure 4 Figure 4 In vitro PRC2 activity of EZH2. Histone methyltransferase reaction was performed using 1.2μM biotinylated peptide substrate (ie, peptide mimicking the H3 tail, H3(21-44)), which has been unmethylated (H3K27me0, open bar or me0), monomethylated ... Table 1 Table 1 Specific activity of PRC2 complexes Go to: Discussion The relevance of somatic mutations in chromatin-modifying enzymes in cancer has recently been emphasized by discoveries of high-frequency somatic mutations in UTX, JMJD demethylases, ARID1A, and in EZH2.1,24–27 However, the mechanisms by which these mutations promote or enable carcinogenesis are largely unknown, as are the relevant modes of allelism (dominance, recessive). We show here, for the first time, a dominant (neomorphic) allele of a histone methyltransferase associated with a specific cancer.  Taken together, our data strongly suggest that EZH2Y641F/N variants in lymphoma act dominantly, through a mechanism that involves altered substrate catalytic specificity of the mutant EZH2 enzyme for its substrates. Our data show that, despite equimolar quantities of mutant and wild-type proteins in malignant cells, there is greater total H3K27me3 in mutant-bearing cell lines and primary tumors. Moreover, the EZH2Y641F/N variants have a strong dominant effect on H3K27me3 levels in cell lines that are wild-type for EZH2. They act in trans to provide a strong gain of function.  The probable mechanism is suggested by structural and enzymatic analysis of the EZH2Y641F/N variants. As shown in the cell-free assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, EZH2Y641F/N cannot carry out trimethylation of unmodified or monomethylated substrates (Figure 4)1 but still are able to form PRC2 complexes (Figure 2E) and increase the steady state of H3K27 trimethylation in vivo (Figure 2C-D). This means that it is probable that the gain of function of EZH2Y641 mutants would be to shift the monomethylated and/or dimethylated state of H3K27 to that of trimethylation (Figure 2D) on some bona fide EZH2 targets. It is clear that in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-histone H3K27me1 and anti-histone H3K27me3,28 that expression of EZH2Y641 mutants could shift the steady-state levels from H3K27me1 (which is correlated with gene activation) and H3K27me2 to H3K27me3, which is correlated with gene repression.29 Whether or not these EZH2Y641 mutants are able to catalyze higher order methylation on non-EZH2 (such as EZH130) targets remains an area of active investigation. The mechanism and the in vitro assays show that EZH2Y641F/N cannot catalyze monomethylation and dimethylation efficiently; therefore, the mutant protein is completely dependent on the presence of wild-type proteins for the gain-of-function effect. This requirement for a wild-type copy of EZH2 is highly analogous to the behavior of the Drosophila E(z)1 allele31,32; E(z)1 (homologous to EZH2Y641N) leads to a phenotypic gain of function and has been shown to act as a dominant repressor of E(z) target genes. However, the unique phenotype of the E(z)1 allele depends on the presence of the wild-type allele, and the E(z)1 enzyme appears to be inactive when assayed in vitro.32  It has been shown that overexpression of EZH2 is a feature of some cancers,2–4 whereas histone H3K27 demethylase UTX was found to be inactivated in other tumors.24,25 This would suggest that the increase in H3K27me3 levels may be achieved in cancer cells by redundant pathways induced by overexpression of EZH2 or inactivation of UTX. Our findings are consistent with this idea, as dominant EZH2Y641 mutations also increase the levels of H3K27me3 (Figure 5). It is currently unknown whether the gain of H3K27me3 in germinal center-derived B-cell lymphomas reflects an increase of methylation at normal PRC2 targets, or possibly a gain of methylation at noncanonical PRC2 targets. The significance of H3K27me3 may well be lineage/cell type dependent, and this will require future conditional alleles and lineage studies to dissect as well as improved efficiency of ChIP-seq methods in small cell populations. However, recent studies have emphasized that GCB lymphomas are dependent on EZH2 and that knockdown of EZH2 in GCB cell lines bearing Y641 mutations results in cell cycle arrest in germinal center B cells.33 Knockdown of EZH2 in this context results in increased expression of PRC2-regulated tumor suppressors. This is consistent with the physiologic roles of EZH2 in B-cell development and differentiation,34–36 although it should be noted that a full understanding of the PRC2 targets in B cells remains to be elucidated. Taken together with the present study, these support the notion that EZH2 is causally implicated.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Model depicting pathways to increase H3K27me3 levels that result in cancer. In this schematic diagram: solid arrow represents a direct effect; dotted arrow, multiple steps that lead to an effect. The observation of a dominant, gain-of-function mutation through altered catalytic preference in histone methyltransferases is unprecedented in cancer and carries important implications for drug development against EZH2. It is interesting to note that the substrate pockets of the mutant enzymes probably have a new, larger shape (smaller side chains of His, Asn, or Phe relative to wild-type Tyr), which potentially could be selectively targeted therapeutically in a strategy similar to that used to develop selective inhibitors of glycine gatekeeper mutants of protein kinases.37  
1085||EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, catalyzes the mono- through trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27). Histone H3K27 trimethylation is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification. Point mutations of the EZH2 gene (Tyr641) have been reported to be linked to subsets of human B-cell lymphoma. The mutant allele is always found associated with a wild-type allele (heterozygous) in disease cells, and the mutations were reported to ablate the enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex for methylating an unmodified peptide substrate. Here we demonstrate that the WT enzyme displays greatest catalytic efficiency (kcat/K) for the zero to monomethylation reaction of H3K27 and diminished efficiency for subsequent (mono- to di- and di- to trimethylation) reactions. In stark contrast, the disease-associated Y641 mutations display very limited ability to perform the first methylation reaction, but have enhanced catalytic efficiency for the subsequent reactions, relative to the WT enzyme. These results imply that the malignant phenotype of disease requires the combined activities of a H3K27 monomethylating enzyme (PRC2 containing WT EZH2 or EZH1) together with the mutant PRC2s for augmented conversion of H3K27 to the trimethylated form. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a human disease that is dependent on the coordinated activities of normal and disease-associated mutant enzymatic function.  Keywords: cancer, enzymology, epigenetics Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a 4 or 5 protein complex that functionally represses gene transcription via posttranslational modification of the chromatin core protein, histone H3. More specifically, PRC2 functions as a histone methyltransferase, catalyzing the selective methylation of lysine residue 27 on histone H3 (H3K27). EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, catalyzing the mono- through trimethylation of H3K27. Trimethylation of H3K27 is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification.  Recently, somatic mutations of Tyr641 (Y641F, Y641N, Y641S, and Y641H) of EZH2 were reported to be associated with follicular lymphoma (FL) and the germinal-center B-cell like (GCB) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (1). In all cases, occurrence of the mutant EZH2 gene was heterozygous, and expression of both WT and mutant alleles was detected in the mutant samples profiled by transcriptome sequencing. It was also demonstrated that all of the mutant forms of EZH2 could be incorporated into the multiprotein PRC2 complex, but that the resulting complexes lacked the ability to catalyze methylation of the H3K27 equivalent residue of a peptidic substrate. Hence, it was concluded that the disease-associated changes at Tyr641 resulted in loss of function with respect to EZH2-catalyzed H3K27 methylation.  A presumptive reduction in the rate of H3K27 methylation due to enzyme heterozygosity seemed to us to be difficult to rationalize as the basis for a malignant phenotype (1, 2), especially in light of previous data indicating that overexpression of EZH2 (3–6), loss-of-function mutations in the corresponding H3K27 demethylase UTX (7), or overexpression of components of the PRC2, such as PHF19/PCL3 involved in increased H3K27 trimethylation (8–10), all result in malignant phenotypes in specific human cancers. Several recent reports indicate that an important component of early lymphomagenesis is the acquisition of stem cell-like characteristics (11, 12). Among these characteristics is enriched DNA methylation of PRC2 target genes, resulting in diminished transcription of these genes (13). Trimethylation of H3K27, catalyzed by the enzymatic activity of EZH2, similarly leads to diminished transcription of these same genes and has thus been reported as an additional, potential progenitor of lymphomagenesis (11–14). EZH2 levels have also directly been implicated in lymphogenesis. For example, Velichutina et al. (14) found that EZH2 mRNA level was directly correlated with cellular proliferation in primary germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tumors, whereas levels of many EZH2 target genes were negatively correlated with proliferation in these same tumors. Likewise, expression levels of EZH2 and the PRC1 component BMI1 have both been linked to lymphogenesis and the degree of malignancy of B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas (15). We were thus motivated to explore the enzymology of the EZH2 mutants in greater detail.  Go to: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Recombinant PRC2 complexes (16) were prepared with WT and Tyr641 mutant versions of human EZH2 (see Materials and Methods). Equal concentrations (nominally 8 nM, based on protein determinations) of each complex were initially tested for the ability to catalyze 3H-methyl transfer from labeled SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) to an unmodified peptide representing the amino acid sequence surrounding H3K27 (H3:21-44) or to native avian erythrocyte oligonucleosomes. As previously reported (1), we found that the WT enzyme displayed robust activity for methyl transfer to this peptidic substrate, but that none of the mutant enzymes displayed significant methyltransferase activity (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the previously reported data and that in Fig. 1A, we found that all of the mutant EZH2 constructs were active methyltransferases against the avian nucleosome substrate (Fig. 1B).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. B-cell lymphoma-associated mutants of EZH2 are active histone methyltransferases. In vitro methyltransferase activity of PRC2 complexes containing wild-type and various Y641 mutants of EZH2 was measured as (A) methyl transfer reactions using a peptide ... There are several potential explanations for the discordant activity of the mutant PRC2 complexes on peptide and nucleosome substrates. One possibility is that substrate recognition sites distal to the enzyme active site (i.e., exosites) are important determinants of substrate binding and turnover; these sites would engage complementary recognition elements on the nucelosome that are not available on small peptidic substrates. However, when Escherichia coli-expressed, recombinant human histone H3 was tested as a substrate for the WT and mutant PRC2 complexes, the resulting pattern of activity was identical to that seen for the peptide substrate (see Supporting Information); that is, the WT enzyme demonstrated robust methyltransferase activity against the H3 substrate, the Y641F mutant showed 7% the activity of WT complex, and all other mutants displayed ≤ 1% the activity of WT complex. Hence, exosite engagement seems an unlikely explanation for the current results. The nucleosome presents many lysine residues beyond H3K27 as potential sites of methylation that would not be present in the small peptidic substrate. Thus, another possibility is that mutation of Y641 alters the substrate specificity of EZH2 to result in methylation of lysine residues other than H3K27. This possibility is unlikely given the excellent agreement between mutant activity on small peptide and recombinant H3 protein substrates. To evaluate this possibility further, we tested the enzymatic activity of the WT and mutant PRC2 complexes against a panel of peptidic substrates that represent all possible lysine residues of histone H3 and histone H4 (see Materials and Methods). All of the enzyme forms showed significant activity only against peptides containing the equivalent of residue H3K27. The specific activity of the mutants, however, was greatly reduced relative to WT in the order WT≫Y641F > Y641S ∼ Y641H > Y641N, again consistent with previous reported findings. The nucleosomes isolated from the avian natural source represent an admixture of states of histone modification, including various states of H3K27 methylations as judged by Western blotting with H3K27 methylation specific antibodies. Hence, another possibility is that the Y641 mutants of EZH2 display differential activity against different methylation states of H3K27.  To understand further the enzymatic activity of these mutants, and to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between activity against peptidic and nucleosome substrates, we studied the ability of the enzyme forms to catalyze further methylation of various H3K27 methylation states in the context of the H3:21-44 peptide. As stated above, we found that all of the mutant enzymes were deficient catalysts of unmodified H3K27 peptide methylation, relative to the WT enzyme. To our surprise, however, all of the mutant enzymes were superior to the WT enzyme in catalyzing further methylation of the mono- and especially the dimethylated H3K27 peptides (Fig. 2). Thus, the data suggest that the WT enzyme is most efficient in catalyzing the zero to monomethylation reaction. The mutant enzymes are defective in catalyzing this initial step, but are more efficient than the WT enzyme in catalyzing the subsequent steps leading from monomethyl to di- and trimethyl H3K27.  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. PRC2 complexes containing mutant EZH2 preferentially catalyze di- and trimethylation of histone H3K27. (A) Methyltransferase activity of mutant and WT complexes on unmethylated peptide (open bars), monomethylated peptide (hatched bars), and dimethylated ... The origins of the differential substrate specificities of WT and mutant EZH2 were explored through steady-state enzyme kinetics. As summarized in Table 1, the mutations have minimal effects on ground-state substrate recognition, as demonstrated by the similar values of Km for nucleosome and of K1/2 for peptide substrates. In all cases the peptidic substrates displayed sigmoidal binding behavior; hence, the concentration of peptide resulting in half-maximal velocity is reported here as K1/2 instead of the more common Michaelis constant, Km (17). This sigmoidal behavior was seen only with peptidic substrates (i.e., nucleosome and recombinant histone substrates displayed classical Michaelis–Menten kinetics), and the origin of this effect is unclear at present. The SAM Km likewise displayed minimal variation among the enzyme forms, ranging from 208 ± 50 to 304 ± 64 nM. Instead, the differences in substrate utilization appear to have their origin in transition state recognition, as demonstrated by differences in kcat values among the enzymes for various substrates (Table 1); as a result, the catalytic efficiency, quantified as the ratio kcat/K (where K is either Km or K1/2, depending on substrate identity; see above), varies between the WT and mutant enzymes for different states of H3K27 methylation (Table 1).  Table 1. Table 1. Steady-state kinetic parameters for methylation reactions catalyzed by PRC2 containing wild-type or Y641 mutants of EZH2 The mutation of Y641 to F, N, H, or S in EZH2 may facilitate multiple rounds of H3K27 methylation by impacting the H-bonding pattern and/or steric crowding in the active site of the enzyme–bisubstrate ternary complex, affecting the formation of a proper water channel for deprotonation of the reacting lysine (18). This inference is drawn by analogy to the crystallographic and molecular dynamic simulation results seen for tyrosine mutation in the related protein lysine methyltransferases LSMT, Dim-5, and SET7/9. For example, when tyrosine 245 of recombinant SET7/9 was mutated to alanine, a change in substrate specificity, similar to what is reported here for EZH2 Y641 mutations, was observed (19). The ability of the Y245A mutant SET7/9 to methylate an unmodified 20-residue peptide, representing the sequence surrounding H3K4, was reduced to ca. 20% of the WT enzyme (20). At the same time, the ability of the Y245A mutant to further methylate H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 peptides was greatly augmented (ca. 7-fold and 5-fold, respectively) relative to the WT enzyme. In contrast to the present results, however, mutation of SET7/9 Y245 to phenylalanine did not enhance mono- to dimethylation nor di- to trimethylation of the peptide; rather, the Y245F mutant displayed minimal catalytic activity for all peptidic substrates. Similarly, the wild-type enzyme G9a can dimethylate H3K9 but is unable to perform the di- to trimethylation reaction. Yet, when tyrosine 1067 of G9a (analogous to Y641 of EZH2) is mutated to phenylalanine, the enzyme now gains the ability to trimethylate H3K9 (21). The tolerance for multiple Y641 mutations in EZH2 suggests that a release of steric crowding may allow greater access for proper alignment of the larger dimethyl lysine as the substrate for the di- to trimethylation reaction. Crystallographic analysis of the protein methyltransferases SET7/9 and G9a reveals that the side chain hydroxyls of the active site tyrosine residues are involved in H-bonding interactions directly with the amine of the methyl-accepting lysine, or indirectly through an intervening water molecule. Although the larger active site of the Y641 mutants is favorable for di- and trimethylation, the loss of the tyrosine hydroxyl hydrogen bond acceptor may result in an unfavorable orientation of the active site for initial methyl transfer to the lysine amine. A complete understanding of the molecular basis for the dramatic reduction in the ability of these mutant enzymes to perform the initial methylation reaction will require additional study.  The implications of the present results for human disease are made clear by the data summarized in Table 1. Cells heterozygous for EZH2 would be expected to display a malignant phenotype, due to the efficient formation of H3K27me1 by the WT enzyme and the efficient, subsequent transition of this progenitor species to abnormally high levels of H3K27me3 by the mutant enzyme form(s). We note that H3K27me1 formation is not exclusively dependent on WT-EZH2 catalysis. Knockout studies of EZH2 and of another PRC2 subunit, EED, have demonstrated H3K27me1 formation can be catalyzed by PRC2 complexes containing either EZH2 or the related protein EZH1, as the catalytic subunit (22). Hence, catalytic coupling between the mutant EZH2 species and PRC2 complexes containing either WT-EZH2 or WT-EZH1 would suffice to augment H3K27me3 formation and thus produce the attendant malignant phenotype. Our data therefore suggest that the malignant phenotype of FL and DLBCL of the GCB subtype, associated with expression of mutant forms of EZH2 (1), is the result of an overall gain of function with respect to formation of the trimethylated form of H3K27.  The steady-state kinetic parameters listed in Table 1 allow us to calculate the expected levels of different H3K27 methylation states for cells heterozygous for the various mutant EZH2 forms, relative to cells homozygous for the WT enzyme. To perform these simulations we made a number of simplifying assumptions: (i) that steady-state enzyme kinetics are relevant to PRC2-catalyzed H3K27 methylation in the cellular context and that all measurements are made at the same time point in cell growth; (ii) that the mutant and the WT enzyme are expressed at equal levels in heterozygous cells and that the total EZH2 level is equal in all cells; (iii) that the cellular concentration of SAM, relative to its Km, is saturating and does not change among the cells; (iv) that the cellular concentration of nucleosome is similar to its Km and likewise does not change among cells; (v) that EZH1 catalyzed methylation of H3K27 was insignificant and constant among the cells; and (vi) that any H3K27 demethylase activity was also constant among the cells. With these assumptions in place, we obtained the predictions illustrated in Fig. 3A for relative levels of H3K27me3 (Top), H3K27me2 (Middle), and H3K27me1 (Bottom). A clear pattern emerges from these simulations. The level of H3K27me3 increases relative to WT cells for all mutant-harboring cells, ranging from a 30% increase for the Y641H mutant to > 400% for the Y641N mutant. At the same time, the levels of H3K27me2 decrease to < 50% of WT for all of the mutants, and the levels of H3K27me1 are reduced by approximately half for all mutants, relative to WT. We then measured the relative levels of the H3K27 methylation states in B-cell lymphoma cell lines that are known to be homozygous for WT EZH2 (OCI-LY19) or heterozygous for EZH2 Y641N (DB, KARPAS 422, and SU-DHL-6) or EZH2 Y641F (WSU-DLCL2) by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). The pattern of relative H3K27 methylation states seen in Fig. 3B is in excellent agreement with the results of the simulations based on in vitro steady-state kinetic parameters, despite the crude assumptions used in the simulations and the use of a nonphysiological peptide surrogate as substrate. Thus, we observe increased H3K27me3 for all mutant-harboring cells relative to WT, decreased H3K27me2 for all mutant-harboring cells relative to WT, and decreased H3K27me1 for at least two of the four mutant cell lines. The near-comparable levels of H3K27me1 in WT and KARPAS 422 and SU-DHL-6 cells may reflect different expression levels of WT and mutant EZH2, different contributions of EZH1, or other factors not accounted for in our simulations. Nevertheless, the concordance between the predicted and experimental patterns of H3K27 methylation status is remarkable and supports our view that enzymatic coupling between WT and mutant EZH2 leads to increased H3K27me3, thus resulting in the malignant phenotype of cells that are heterozygous for these mutants.  Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Steady-state enzyme kinetics predicts the relative patterns of H3K27 methylation status in EZH2 WT and heterozygous mutant lymphoma cell lines. (A) Predicted relative levels of H3K27me3 (Top), H3K27me2 (Middle), and H3K27me1 (Bottom) for cells containing ... The foregoing interpretation of our data also helps to reconcile the existence of cancer-associated overexpression of EZH2 (3–6) or PRC2-associated proteins (e.g., PHF19/PCL3) (8–10) and also loss-of-function genotypes for the histone H3K27 demethylase UTX (7). Loss of UTX activity would be enzymatically equivalent to a gain of function for EZH2, in either situation resulting in greater steady-state levels of trimethylated H3K27 in cancer cells (Fig. 4). The mono-, di-, and trimethylation states of histone H3K27 are associated with different functions in transcriptional control. Histone H3K27 monomethylation is associated with active transcription of genes that are poised for transcription (23, 24). In contrast, trimethylation of histone H3K27 is associated with either transcriptionally repressed genes (23, 25) or genes that are poised for transcription when histone H3K4 trimethylation is in cis (26). Taken together, alterations in the PRC2 complex activity reported in cancer, including the Y641 mutation of EZH2, are predicted to result in an increase in the trimethylated state of histone H3K27 and to thus result in transcriptional repression.  Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Proposed mechanisms leading to aberrantly high levels of trimethylation on histone H3K27 in cancer include (A) mutation of Y641 in EZH2 resulting in a change in substrate preference from the nonmethylated to the mono- and dimethylated histone H3K27, ( ... EZH2 and other protein methyltransferases have been suggested to be attractive targets for drug discovery (27–29). The present data also suggest an experimental strategy for development of FL and GCB lymphoma-specific drugs. As the differences in substrate recognition between the WT and disease-associated mutants derive from transition state interactions, small molecule inhibitors that selectively mimic the transition state of the mutant EZH2 over that of the WT enzyme should prove to be effective in blocking H3K27 methylation in mutation-bearing cells. Inhibitors of this type would be expected to display a large therapeutic index, as target-mediated toxicity would be minimal for any cells bearing only the WT enzyme. Transition state mimicry has proved to be an effective strategy for drug design in many disease areas (17, 30). Whether or not sufficient differentiation between the transition states of the WT and mutant EZH2 enzymes can be designed into a small molecule drug remains to be determined.  In summary, the present results point to a critical dependency on enzymatic coupling between enzymes that perform H3K27 monomethylation and the mutant forms of EZH2, for pathogenesis in FL and the GCB subtype of DLBCL. This is an example of a human disease that is dependent on such coupling of catalytic activity between normal (H3K27me1) and disease-associated mutant (H3K27me2/3) enzymes. We are unaware of other examples of this mechanism of pathogenesis in human disease.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Recombinant 5-Component PRC2. Wild-type EZH2 (NM_004456) or Tyr641 mutants were coexpressed with wild-type AEBP2 (NM_153207), EED (NM_003797), SUZ12 (NM_015355), and RbAp48 (NM_005610) in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using a baculovirus expression system. An N-terminal FLAG tag on the EED was used to purify active PRC2 complex from cell lysates (BPS Bioscience, catalog number 51004). The purity of the final PRC2 preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining.  Recombinant Human Histone H3. Recombinant human histone H3.1, expressed in and purified from E. coli (catalog number M250S) was purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc.  H3, H4 Peptide Panel. A library consisting of 44 peptides of 15 amino acids each was synthesized by 21st Century Biochemicals. This peptide panel encompassed all of the amino acids of human histones H3 and H4 with 10 residue overlaps between consecutive peptide sequences. The N terminus of each peptide was appended with biotin, and the C termini were represented as the amide. Purity (> 95%) and identity were confirmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectral analysis.  For study of the H3K27 methylation status dependence of enzyme activity, peptides were synthesized representing the amino acid sequence of human H3 from residues 21–44 (H3:21–44) with lysine 27 represented as the unmodified, monomethylated, dimethylated, or trimethylated side chain amine. These peptides were purchased from New England Peptide with biotin appended to the C terminus of each peptide.  In Vitro Assays of PRC2 Methyltransferase Activity. Flashplate assay with peptide substrate. For initial comparison of WT and Y641 mutants of EZH2, biotinylated histone H3:21-44 peptide containing unmethylated K27 (New England Peptide), monomethylated K27 (Millipore), or dimethylated K27 (Millipore) at a concentration of 800 nM was combined with a mixture of SAM at 1,700 nM, and 300 nM tritiated SAM (PerkinElmer, Inc.). This substrate combination was then added to the PRC2 in assay buffer [20 mM N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine (Bicine), 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween20, 0.005% bovine skin gelatin (BSG), pH 7.6]. Reactions were allowed to proceed for the indicated time interval and then quenched by addition of excess cold SAM (600-μM final concentration). Quenched reaction mixtures were transferred to a streptavidin-coated Flashplate (PerkinElmer, catalog number SMP410), allowed to bind for 1 h, and then detected on a TopCount NXT HTS (PerkinElmer). Each time point represents the average of six individual reactions. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined under identical reaction conditions except that the concentration of peptide or SAM was varied, while at saturating conditions of the other substrate. Velocity was plotted as a function of varied substrate concentration and the data were fitted to the untransformed version of the Michaelis–Menten equation or the untransformed version of a sigmoidal kinetic equation (30) to calculate values of K and kcat (30). Standard errors of fitted parameters are listed in Table 1 and were used to construct the error bars illustrated in Fig. 2 B and C. Errors associated with kcat/K (Table 1) were calculated according to standard methods of error propogation; the fractional error of kcat/K was determined as  equation image	[1] where μkcat is the standard error of kcat and μK is the standard error of K.  Filterplate assay with histone and oligonucleosome. Chicken erythrocyte oligonucleosomes were purified as previously described (31). Nucleosomes or histones were combined with a mixture of SAM and tritiated SAM and added to PRC2 in assay buffer (20 mM Bicine, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.002% Tween20, 0.005% BSG, pH 7.6). Reactions were run and quenched as above. Quenched reaction mixture was transferred to a glass fiber filterplate (Millipore, catalog number MSFBN6B) and washed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid and allowed to dry. Microscint Zero (30 μL) was added and tritium incorporation was detected on a TopCount. Steady-state parameters for reactions with nucelosomes were determined under identical reaction conditions except that the concentration of nucleosome or SAM was varied while at saturating conditions of the other substrate. Velocity was plotted as a function of varied substrate concentration and fitted to the untransformed version of the Michaelis–Menten equation to derive the values of Km and kcat as described above.  Evaluation of H3K27 methylation status in cells. The cell lines OCI-LY19 (ACC 528), KARPAS-422 (ACC 32), and WSU-DLCL2 (ACC 575) were obtained from DSMZ. The cell lines DB (CRL-2289) and SU-DHL2 (CRL-2959) were obtained from ATCC. OCI-LY19, WSU-DLCL2, and DB cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, and KARPAS-422 and SU-DHL2 cell lines were grown in RPMI medium 1640 plus 20% FBS. Cells were grown to a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/mL and 1 × 107 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 264  × g, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed by resuspension in a 10× pellet volume of RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, and 1mM EDTA (Millipore #20-188), plus 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche # 1836153). Lysates were sonicated by two rounds of ten 1-s bursts at setting 3 with a Misonix XL-2000 to ensure efficient histone extraction, and cleared by centrifugation at 4° using a bench top centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Four micrograms of each lysate was fractionated on 4–20% Tris-Glycine gel (Invitrogen), transferred to PVDF, and probed with the following antibodies in Odyssey blocking buffer: mouse anti-EZH2 (CST 3147; 1∶2,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (CST 9733; 1∶10,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me2 (CST 9755; 1∶5,000 dilution), rabbit anti-H3K27me1 (Active Motif 39377; 1∶5,000 dilution), and mouse antiTotal H3 (CST 3638; 1∶20,000 dilution). Following primary Ab incubation, membranes were probed with IRDye 800CW donkey-anti-mouse IgG (LiCOR #926-32212) or Alexa Fluor 680 goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen #A-21076) secondary Ab and imaged using the LiCOR Odyssey system.  Next-generation sequencing of follicular lymphoma and diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma has revealed frequent somatic, heterozygous Y641 mutations in the histone methyltransferase EZH2. Heterozygosity and the presence of equal quantities of both mutant and wild-type mRNA and expressed protein suggest a dominant mode of action. Surprisingly, B-cell lymphoma cell lines and lymphoma samples harboring heterozygous EZH2Y641 mutations have increased levels of histone H3 Lys-27–specific trimethylation (H3K27me3). Expression of EZH2Y641F/N mutants in cells with EZH2WT resulted in an increase of H3K27me3 levels in vivo. Structural modeling of EZH2Y641 mutants suggests a “Tyr/Phe switch” model whereby structurally neutral, nontyrosine residues at position 641 would decrease affinity for unmethylated and monomethylated H3K27 substrates and potentially favor trimethylation. We demonstrate, using in vitro enzyme assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, that Y641 mutations result in a decrease in monomethylation and an increase in trimethylation activity of the enzyme relative to the wild-type enzyme. This represents the first example of a disease-associated gain-of-function mutation in a histone methyltransferase, whereby somatic EZH2 Y641 mutations in lymphoma act dominantly to increase, rather than decrease, histone methylation. The dominant mode of action suggests that allele-specific EZH2 inhibitors should be a future therapeutic strategy for this disease.  Go to: Introduction Non-Hodgkin lymphomas represent a diverse spectrum of distinct entities with the 2 most common types represented by follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). There are 2 molecular subtypes of DLBCL based on cell-of-origin distinctions: the activated B-cell type and the germinal center B-cell (GCB) type. Both follicular lymphoma and the GCB subtype of DLBCL derive from germinal center B cells. We have shown that, in 7% of follicular lymphomas and 22% of GCB-type DLBCL, a single point mutation in EZH2, which results in a single amino-acid change at position 641, is selected for; EZH2 (Tyr641 or WT) was mutated to phenylalanine (Y641F), asparagine (Y641N), histidine (Y641H), or serine (Y641S).1 EZH2 has been implicated as an oncoprotein often overexpressed in many solid tumors.2–4 Initial analysis of the activity of Y641 variants in cell-free reconstituted Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) complexes using unmethylated peptides suggested that the mutations behaved as a loss of function.1  EZH2 is the catalytic member of the PRC2; however, EZH2 alone has very weak histone-methylating activity. Other members of the PRC2 complex include EED, SUZ12, AEBP2, and RbAp48 and are required for full activity. The PRC2 complex has been shown to exhibit in vitro enzyme activity on histone peptide substrates and nucleosomes. EZH2 is a member of the Su(var)3,9, enhancer of zest, Trithorax (SET) domain containing family of histone methyltransferases (HMTases); all contain a conserved SET domain. Genetic and biochemical analysis of EZH2 SET domain has revealed their histone methyltransferase function associated with histone H3 Lys-27–specific trimethylation (H3K27me3) in vivo. Recently, a structural basis for the allosteric modulation of EZH2 activity by EED has been elucidated.5  Structural and biochemical data from other SET domain HMTases have shed light not only on the molecular mechanism of histone methylation but also the specific residues of the conserved SET domain responsible for these reactions. For example, all active HMTases contain a catalytic triad—the asparagine-histidine-serine (NHS) motif,6 and mutation of any one of these residues in the active site abolishes the activity of the enzyme. Studies have also implicated residues important for the binding of the S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM)7 and for recognition of the amino-acid sequence of the histone peptide tail.8 However, these studies have not shed light on the role of the highly evolutionarily conserved Tyr 641 of EZH2.  Through the use of molecular modeling and recently published molecular and biochemical data from an allelic series of G9a9 and by analogy to the “Tyr/Phe” switch alleles in other methyltransferases,10,11 we show that Tyr 641 of EZH2 is implicated in substrate and product specificity. Taken together with the finding that DLBCL cell lines heterozygous for EZH2 mutants exhibit higher steady-state levels of H3K27me3 and in vitro enzyme studies, a possible mechanism may be proposed. This report provides evidence that EZH2 Y641 mutant protein-containing PRC2 complexes exhibit increased activity on dimethylated peptides compared with wild-type containing PRC2 complexes, thereby shifting the steady state of H3K27 to favor trimethylation in vivo. As previously described, the EZH2 mutant-containing PRC2 complexes are inactive on unmethylated histone peptides,1 implying that the Y641F/N mutations can only act in the presence of a wild-type EZH2.  Go to: Methods Reagents  Antibodies. Rabbit polyclonal anti-histone H3 (ab1791), anti-histone H3K9me3 (ab8898), anti-histone H4K20me3 (ab9053), anti-EED (ab4469), and mouse monoclonal anti-histone H3K27me3 (ab6002) were purchased from Abcam. Rabbit polyclonal anti-histone H3K27me1 (07-448) and anti-histone H3K27me2 (05-821), anti-SUZ12 (ab12073), and mouse monoclonal anti-histone H3K27me3 (07-449) and anti-SUZ12 (04-046) were purchased from Millipore; the specificity of methyl-specific anti-histone H3K27 antibodies was tested using H3K27 methylated peptides (supplemental Figure 3, available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). Mouse monoclonal anti-EZH2 (612667) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Mouse monoclonal anti-Flag M2 (F1804) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and mouse monoclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP; MMS-118P) was from Covance Research Products. Antibiotin was from Cell Signaling Technology, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was from RDI Division of Fitzgerald Industries International.  Plasmids. pDONR223 human EZH2 was from the human ORFeome collection.12 Point mutations were made to generate EZH2Y641F and EZH2Y641N. These ORFs were then transferred into pcDNA6.2 GFP-V5 (Invitrogen) using the LR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmids containing mouse Ezh2, pCMV FLAG-Ezh2WT, and FLAG-Ezh2H689A were gifts from D. Reinberg (New York University, New York, NY).13 Plasmid inserts were fully sequenced to confirm their identity. For viral vectors, mutant constructs were generated using site-directed mutagenesis of the RefSeq EZH2 (NM_004456) as previously described.14 For transfer into a retroviral vector system, EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified, A-tailed using Taq polymerase, and cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen) from where it was transferred into a Gateway-adapted version of pSF9114 upstream of the internal ribosomal entry site and the enhanced GFP gene. As a control, the pSF91 vector carrying only the internal ribosomal entry site-enhanced GFP cassette was used. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Generation of recombinant ecotropic retrovirus-producing GP + E86 cells was performed as previously described.15  Primers  Primers include the following: EZH2-HA fw N-terminal MluI, gagagaacgcgtaaccatgtacccatacgacgtcccagactacgctatgggccagactgggaag; EZH2-HA fw N-terminal MfeI, gagagacaattgaaccatgtacccatacgacgtcccagactacgctatgggccagactgggaag; and EZH2-HA rev, gagagagtcgactcaagggatttccatttctcttt.  Peptides. Biotinylated peptides, H3 (1-21) (#12-403), H3 (21-44) (#12-404), H3(21-44)K27(me1) (#12-567), H3(21-44)K27(me2) (#12-566), and H3(21-44)K27(me3) (#12-565), were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The purity for each peptide was assessed using mass spectrometry to be more than 95% (data not shown) and identity confirmed by dot blotting (supplemental Figure 3).  Clinical samples. Snap-frozen initial diagnostic lymph node biopsies with a confirmed diagnosis of DLBCL were studied. In total, 10 cases were analyzed by Western blotting, including 5 cases with confirmed wild-type EZH2 and 5 mutant cases. All cases were identified by whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing, and the DNA status then confirmed by Sanger sequencing.9 Informed consent for these studies was obtained for all patients together with research ethics approval in accordance with the British Columbia Cancer Agency policy and the Declaration of Helsinki.  Cell lines and transfection  DLBCL cell lines harboring EZH2WT or heterozygous for EZH2Y641F or EZH2Y641N (imported from the DSMZ; www.dsmz.de) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells (150 000 cells per well of a 6-well plate) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or TransIT−LT1 (Mirus) with 1 to 5 μg of plasmids. Stable cell lines were made by transfection of HEK293T cells with the respective plasmids and then selection with blasticidine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 week. Pools of stable lines expressing GFP-alone or GFP-tagged proteins were used for the experiments.  Western blotting and immunoprecipitation  Standard methods of Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were used; details are in the supplemental data. Densitometry measurements of bands were used to calculate H3K27me3/totalH3 by integrating each peak in ImageJ (1.44n, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij) software.  Large-scale immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry  A total of 3 × 108 cells from the WSU-DLCL2 and DOHH2 cell lines were harvested, and nuclear lysates were prepared as described in the supplemental data. For large-scale immunoprecipitations, 160 mg of nuclear lysates was diluted with binding buffer and precleared with Sepharose 4B for 1 hour at 4°C. EZH2 complexes were immunoprecipitated with 30 μg of anti-EZH2 antibody (#612667, BD Biosciences) by rotating overnight at 4°C. Antibody-bound protein complexes were then incubated with 120 μL of Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 4°C. Bound EZH2 complexes were washed 5 times with 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 30 μL of sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading dye. Samples were resolved using a 4% to 12% gradient gel (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and stained with colloidal Coomassie stain. After destaining, the gel was cut into 16 slices per lane corresponding to a specific molecular weight range. In-gel trypsin digestion was performed, and peptides were extracted from the gel using standard protocols.16  High-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry (MS) was performed on a 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/Sciex) coupled to an Agilent 1100 Nano-HPLC (Agilent Technologies) using a nano-electrospray interface, as described in supplemental data.  Histone methyltransferase assay  Similar batches of recombinant reconstituted active PRC2 complexes as used previously1 containing EZH2WT(51 004), EZH2Y641N, or EZH2Y641F were purchased from BPS Biosciences. Methyltransferase assays were performed using a kit (#17-330, Millipore) as per the manufacturer's instructions, except that biotinylated peptides were used as substrates; 250 ng of active PRC2 complex was incubated with 0.67μM 3H-SAM (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences), 1μM biotinylated peptide in 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 0.5mM dithiothreitol for 30 minutes at 30°C in a 10-μL volume. A total of 5 μL was spotted on a P81 square paper (Millipore), washed (twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid and once with 100% ethanol) to remove unincorporated SAM, air-dried, and placed in a glass scintillation vial with 5 mL of scintillation fluid (ScintiSafe Econo1, Fisher Chemical) and counted on a 1900TR Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).  Modeling  A model of the EZH2 core catalytic domain lining the substrate lysine binding channel was built by homology to the G9a/EHMT2 structure (PDB code 2o8j), based on the alignment shown in supplemental Figure 6 and supplemental Figure 8. The EZH2 sequence was threaded onto the G9a backbone, and when homologous, G9a side chains were used as a template to position EZH2 residues, according to the “minimize tethers” command using ICM, Version 3.6-1g (Molsoft LLC17).  Retroviral infection and B-cell in vitro differentiation assay  Parental strain mice were bred and maintained as approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee. Primary mouse bone marrow cells were transduced as previously described with minor modifications.18 Details are in the supplemental data.  Go to: Results EZH2Y641F/N proteins are expressed approximately 1:1 with wild-type EZH2 in DLBCL cell lines  Conspicuously, the EZH2 mutations identified in GCB lymphomas are all located in exon 15 of EZH2, and all are missense mutations that change a single highly evolutionarily conserved tyrosine residue in the catalytic SET domain (Tyr641 or WT) to phenylalanine (Y641F), asparagine (Y641N), histidine (Y641H), or serine (Y641S).1 This recurrent pattern of a heterozygous somatic mutation in a functionally conserved region, affecting a single residue, is highly suggestive of a gain of dominant mode of action, either dominant negative or a gain-of-function/neomorph. Both wild-type (EZH2WT) and EZH2Y641 variant transcripts could be observed in lymphoma-derived cell lines (Y641N: DB, Karpas 422, SU-DHL-6, and Y641F: WSU-DLCL-2) bearing the mutations (supplemental Figure 1). Potentially, the mutations at EZH2Y641 could alter the stability of the protein. To investigate this possibility, we developed a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode MS signature for tryptic peptides covering the mutated region of EZH2 (wild-type, MutF) and a common region from tandem MS spectra of recombinant EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F (Figure 1A; supplemental Figure 2A-B) and used this to estimate the abundance of mutant EZH2 in malignant cells. To determine the amount of mutant EZH2 in a DLCBL cell line, we immunoprecipitated total endogenous EZH2 from nuclear lysates of the WSU-DLCL2 cell line (EZH2Y641F) and the DOHH2 cell line (EZH2WT) from 2 independent experiments. Gel electrophoresis fractions of the immunoprecipitates encompassing the size of EZH2 were analyzed for the peptides by MRM-MS. Signals for the wild-type, MutF, and common peptides were observed in the WSU-DLCL2 cell line, whereas only wild-type and common signals were observed in the DOHH2 cell line (Figure 1B; supplemental Figure 2C; and data not shown), demonstrating that both EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F proteins were present in the WSU-DLCL2 cell line. The wild-type/MutF peak area ratios were compared with the wild-type/MutF peak area ratios of an external standard curve of mixtures of recombinant EZH2WT and EZH2Y641F (Figure 1C). The percentage EZH2WT was calculated from an equation fit to the standard curve. The comparison indicated that there was a 40:60 EZH2WT/EZH2Y641F protein ratio in the WSU-DLCL2 sample (Figure 1C; supplemental Figure 2C); thus, approximately equal quantities of mutant EZH2 protein are present, showing that the mutations do not adversely affect the stability of the protein in vivo and therefore that any differences in activity should not be explained by a highly skewed ratio of wild-type and mutant proteins alone.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Quantitation of EZH2 wild-type and EZH2 Y641F (MutF) protein expression by mass spectrometry. (A) Tandem MS spectra of recombinant EZH2 wild-type and MutF peptides (residues 635-654) used in the MRM assay. Peptide fragments (y and b ions) identified are ... EZH2Y641 mutation bearing B-cell lymphoma cell lines and GCB lymphoma containing tissues exhibit higher levels of H3K27me3 than wild-type  Initial studies1 of EZH2Y641F/N cell-free, reconstituted PRC2 complexes showed that the mutant EZH2-containing PRC2 complexes had 7-fold less activity in converting unmethylated H3K27 target peptides, compared with wild-type. This would suggest that mutation-bearing cell lines and tumors should have globally reduced H3K27me3 levels. A direct comparison is complicated by the nonisogenic status of the cell lines and, in the case of primary tumor material, by variable tumor cellularity. Nevertheless, we measured H3K27me3 (with 2 different H3K27me3 antibodies, verified for monospecificity; see “Western blotting and immunoprecipitation”; supplemental Figure 3) with respect to total H3, in a series of GCB-derived lymphoma cell lines, sequenced to determine the presence or absence of Y641 mutations. Unexpectedly, we found that EZH2Y641F/N bearing cell lines (Figure 2A,G) and tumors (Figure 2B,H) generally exhibited greater levels of H3K27me3 than wild-type cases, suggesting hyperactivity of the PRC2 complexes.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Y641 mutations in B-cell lines and tumors increase steady state of H3K27me3. (A) Steady-state H3K27me3 levels in DLBCL. Nuclear lysates from DLCBCLs with either wild-type EZH2 (Pfeiffer, MD903, NU-DHL-1, NU-DUL-1, DOHH2, and Toledo) or heterozygous for ... EZH2Y641F/N mutants act dominantly in HEK293T and in vitro differentiated B cells to increase H3K27me3 levels  The first 2 sets of observations strongly suggested that EZH2Y641F/N mutants could act dominantly in cells to increase H3K27me3. To test this idea, we expressed wild-type and EZH2Y641F/N proteins in HEK293T cells (wild-type for EZH2) and measured the effect on total H3K27me3 levels. Both stable and transient expression of EZH2Y641F/N mutant proteins in a wild-type context (HEK293T cells) results in a significant increase in H3K27me3 (Figure 2C; supplemental Figure 4), whereas wild-type EZH2 or the methyltransferase dead EZH2H689A,19 expressed in the same cell types results in a barely detectable increase in H3K27me3 (Figure 2D). Notably, the increase in the steady-state levels of H3K27me3 occurred, even though stable expression of GFP-EZH2Y641 protein was lower compared with endogenous EZH2 (Figure 2C upper band). To show that GFP-EZH2 was expressed as part of the PRC2,13 we immunoprecipitated GFP-tagged EZH2 and probed with EZH2, EED, or SUZ12. As shown in Figure 2E, mutant EZH2 was able to coprecipitate with other members of the PRC2 complex. EZH2Y641 mutants thus shifted the in vivo equilibrium levels of H3K27 methylation from monomethylation and dimethylation to predominantly trimethylation (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the cell lines bearing EZH2Y641F/N mutations are also uniformly and markedly more resistant (supplemental Figure 5) to 3-deazaneplanocin A, a global small-molecule inhibitor of single-carbon transfer methyltransferases, which has been reported as a nonspecific inhibitor of EZH2 activity20,21 (specific inhibitors have yet to be described). Finally, we asked whether Y641 variants were capable of conferring a gain of H3K27me3 on B-cell lineages in the mouse. Primary murine primary bone marrow cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing GFP and either wild-type EZH2 or EZH2Y641F and differentiated into the B-cell lineage in the presence of IL7 and FLT3-L. Measurement of total H3K27me3 again showed increased H3K27me3 (Figure 2F) in cells bearing EZH2Y641F, whereas EZH2WT constructs did not confer this phenotype (Figure 2F).  Structural modeling suggests that Tyr 641 residue may be involved in product equilibrium  We sought to understand why EZH2Y641F/N variants act dominantly through a structural analysis of this region in EZH2. Scanning mutagenesis and solved structures have provided insights into regions governing substrate preferences and specificity of several methytransferases; however, a fully solved structure of the EZH2 protein is not currently available. We therefore undertook structural homology modeling of the catalytic core region of EZH2 on the high resolution crystal structures of the lysine dimethyltransferase, G9a, and the lysine monomethyltransferase, SETD7 for which there are also detailed enzymatic data9,10 (Figure 3; supplemental Figures 6-8). Y641 of EZH2 aligns with Y1067 in G9a, which when mutated to Phe was recently shown to convert G9a into a trimethyltransferase with a concomitant decrease in monomethylation and dimethylation activity.9 Similarly, the analogous residue in SETD7 (Y245) can also confer trimethyltransferase activity on SETD7 when mutated to Ala.10 The structures reveal that Tyr in this position forms a hydrogen bond with the substrate lysine amino nitrogen moiety and keeps one of its lone pair electrons oriented away from the SAM methyl donor (Figure 3 black arrow). Thus, this Tyr residue “ties up” the face of the recipient lysyl nitrogen to which the third methyl would otherwise be transferred. This Tyr-substrate hydrogen bond also contributes to the preferred binding affinity of the enzyme for monomethylated and unmethylated substrates as evidenced by the weaker Km values of the Y1067F G9a mutants for unmethylated and monomethylated substrates.9 Furthermore, the Km of G9a Y1067F for dimethylated substrate reflects a stronger affinity for H3K27me2 than for monomethylated or unmethylated substrates.9 In the trimethyltransferases, such as EZH2, this tyrosine residue is also conserved, probably facilitating the first 2 methyl transfer reactions. Because the active sites of EZH2WT can also accommodate a third methyl group, it has probably evolved a compromise between monomethylation, dimethylation, and trimethylation (relative to G9a, for example), perhaps via small structural adjustments that allow it to carry out trimethylation, even in the presence of the Y641 residue. Thus, mutation of Y641 in EZH2 to residues, such as Phe (F) or Asn (N), which do not disturb the structure, can be predicted to abrogate the affinity for unmethylated or monomethylated lysine substrates while at the same time reducing steric crowding in the active site, thereby potentially facilitating the catalytic efficiency for trimethylation.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Homology model of the active site of EZH2. The model is based on sequence and structure alignment with histone dimethyltransferase G9a/EHMT2 (PDBID 2O8J).9 This was also structurally aligned with GLP/EHMT1 bound to an H3K9me2 peptide substrate (PDBID ... Mutations of these tyrosine residues (analogous to Y641 in EZH2) result in a shift of product equilibrium to favor the trimethylated state. The structural and functional basis of the substitution of Tyr to smaller residues, particularly Phe, is known as the Tyr/Phe switch.11,22 Although the Tyr/Phe switch has been described at other residues from scanning mutagenesis in vitro, this is the first example of a disease-associated Tyr/Phe switch.  EZH2Y641-containing PRC2 complexes show increased substrate preference for dimethylated peptide in vitro  To test the structural hypothesis that EZH2Y641 mutations have a reduced ability to methylate H3K27me0/1 substrates but increased ability to methylate H3K27me2 substrates, we next studied the function of the enzyme in vitro. Because the relative catalytic efficiency of the EZH2/PRC2 complex for each methyl addition step is poorly understood, we carried out a 3H methyl incorporation assay using recombinant PRC2 complexes,23 containing EED, SUZ12, AEBP2, RbAp48, and wild-type or EZH2Y641 mutants, as previously described.1 We assayed the activity of the variant proteins by measuring 3H-methyl incorporation, using unmodified, chemically synthesized monomethylated and dimethylated K27 substrate peptides, in preference to nucleosomes because the latter contain endogenous histone modifications (supplemental Figure 3) that make nucleosome assays difficult to interpret (supplemental Figure 9). Strikingly, EZH2Y641 mutants showed (Figure 4) strongly reduced activity on unmethylated or monomethylated peptides but markedly enhanced activity on dimethylated peptides compared with EZH2 wild-type containing PRC2 complexes. We estimated the specific activity of the protein complexes (Table 1) and observed that the EZH2Y641F/N containing PRC2 complexes are approximately twice as active on dimethylated peptides compared with wild-type. These data indicate that EZH2Y641F/N mutations alter the substrate specificity, as suggested by the structural model, in favor of dimethylated peptides compared with PRC2 containing complexes with only wild-type EZH2.  Figure 4 Figure 4 In vitro PRC2 activity of EZH2. Histone methyltransferase reaction was performed using 1.2μM biotinylated peptide substrate (ie, peptide mimicking the H3 tail, H3(21-44)), which has been unmethylated (H3K27me0, open bar or me0), monomethylated ... Table 1 Table 1 Specific activity of PRC2 complexes Go to: Discussion The relevance of somatic mutations in chromatin-modifying enzymes in cancer has recently been emphasized by discoveries of high-frequency somatic mutations in UTX, JMJD demethylases, ARID1A, and in EZH2.1,24–27 However, the mechanisms by which these mutations promote or enable carcinogenesis are largely unknown, as are the relevant modes of allelism (dominance, recessive). We show here, for the first time, a dominant (neomorphic) allele of a histone methyltransferase associated with a specific cancer.  Taken together, our data strongly suggest that EZH2Y641F/N variants in lymphoma act dominantly, through a mechanism that involves altered substrate catalytic specificity of the mutant EZH2 enzyme for its substrates. Our data show that, despite equimolar quantities of mutant and wild-type proteins in malignant cells, there is greater total H3K27me3 in mutant-bearing cell lines and primary tumors. Moreover, the EZH2Y641F/N variants have a strong dominant effect on H3K27me3 levels in cell lines that are wild-type for EZH2. They act in trans to provide a strong gain of function.  The probable mechanism is suggested by structural and enzymatic analysis of the EZH2Y641F/N variants. As shown in the cell-free assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, EZH2Y641F/N cannot carry out trimethylation of unmodified or monomethylated substrates (Figure 4)1 but still are able to form PRC2 complexes (Figure 2E) and increase the steady state of H3K27 trimethylation in vivo (Figure 2C-D). This means that it is probable that the gain of function of EZH2Y641 mutants would be to shift the monomethylated and/or dimethylated state of H3K27 to that of trimethylation (Figure 2D) on some bona fide EZH2 targets. It is clear that in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-histone H3K27me1 and anti-histone H3K27me3,28 that expression of EZH2Y641 mutants could shift the steady-state levels from H3K27me1 (which is correlated with gene activation) and H3K27me2 to H3K27me3, which is correlated with gene repression.29 Whether or not these EZH2Y641 mutants are able to catalyze higher order methylation on non-EZH2 (such as EZH130) targets remains an area of active investigation. The mechanism and the in vitro assays show that EZH2Y641F/N cannot catalyze monomethylation and dimethylation efficiently; therefore, the mutant protein is completely dependent on the presence of wild-type proteins for the gain-of-function effect. This requirement for a wild-type copy of EZH2 is highly analogous to the behavior of the Drosophila E(z)1 allele31,32; E(z)1 (homologous to EZH2Y641N) leads to a phenotypic gain of function and has been shown to act as a dominant repressor of E(z) target genes. However, the unique phenotype of the E(z)1 allele depends on the presence of the wild-type allele, and the E(z)1 enzyme appears to be inactive when assayed in vitro.32  It has been shown that overexpression of EZH2 is a feature of some cancers,2–4 whereas histone H3K27 demethylase UTX was found to be inactivated in other tumors.24,25 This would suggest that the increase in H3K27me3 levels may be achieved in cancer cells by redundant pathways induced by overexpression of EZH2 or inactivation of UTX. Our findings are consistent with this idea, as dominant EZH2Y641 mutations also increase the levels of H3K27me3 (Figure 5). It is currently unknown whether the gain of H3K27me3 in germinal center-derived B-cell lymphomas reflects an increase of methylation at normal PRC2 targets, or possibly a gain of methylation at noncanonical PRC2 targets. The significance of H3K27me3 may well be lineage/cell type dependent, and this will require future conditional alleles and lineage studies to dissect as well as improved efficiency of ChIP-seq methods in small cell populations. However, recent studies have emphasized that GCB lymphomas are dependent on EZH2 and that knockdown of EZH2 in GCB cell lines bearing Y641 mutations results in cell cycle arrest in germinal center B cells.33 Knockdown of EZH2 in this context results in increased expression of PRC2-regulated tumor suppressors. This is consistent with the physiologic roles of EZH2 in B-cell development and differentiation,34–36 although it should be noted that a full understanding of the PRC2 targets in B cells remains to be elucidated. Taken together with the present study, these support the notion that EZH2 is causally implicated.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Model depicting pathways to increase H3K27me3 levels that result in cancer. In this schematic diagram: solid arrow represents a direct effect; dotted arrow, multiple steps that lead to an effect. The observation of a dominant, gain-of-function mutation through altered catalytic preference in histone methyltransferases is unprecedented in cancer and carries important implications for drug development against EZH2. It is interesting to note that the substrate pockets of the mutant enzymes probably have a new, larger shape (smaller side chains of His, Asn, or Phe relative to wild-type Tyr), which potentially could be selectively targeted therapeutically in a strategy similar to that used to develop selective inhibitors of glycine gatekeeper mutants of protein kinases.37  
1086||Trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is a repressive posttranslational modification mediated by the histone methyltransferase EZH2. EZH2 is a component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 and is overexpressed in many cancers. In B-cell lymphomas, its substrate preference is frequently altered through somatic mutation of the EZH2 Y641 residue. Herein, we identify mutation of EZH2 A677 to a glycine (A677G) among lymphoma cell lines and primary tumor specimens. Similar to Y641 mutant cell lines, an A677G mutant cell line revealed aberrantly elevated H3K27me3 and decreased monomethylated H3K27 (H3K27me1) and dimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me2). A677G EZH2 possessed catalytic activity with a substrate specificity that was distinct from those of both WT EZH2 and Y641 mutants. Whereas WT EZH2 displayed a preference for substrates with less methylation [unmethylated H3K27 (H3K27me0):me1:me2 kcat/Km ratio = 9:6:1] and Y641 mutants preferred substrates with greater methylation (H3K27me0:me1:me2 kcat/Km ratio = 1:2:13), the A677G EZH2 demonstrated nearly equal efficiency for all three substrates (H3K27me0:me1:me2 kcat/Km ratio = 1.1:0.6:1). When transiently expressed in cells, A677G EZH2, but not WT EZH2, increased global H3K27me3 and decreased H3K27me2. Structural modeling of WT and mutant EZH2 suggested that the A677G mutation acquires the ability to methylate H3K27me2 through enlargement of the lysine tunnel while preserving activity with H3K27me0/me1 substrates through retention of the Y641 residue that is crucial for orientation of these smaller substrates. This mutation highlights the interplay between Y641 and A677 residues in the substrate specificity of EZH2 and identifies another lymphoma patient population that harbors an activating mutation of EZH2.  Recent genome-wide sequencing studies have revealed several genes that are frequently altered in non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including EZH2, MLL2, MEF2B, CREBBP, and TP53 among others (1–3). Many of these genes mediate, either directly or indirectly, through the recruitment of cofactors, the array of posttranslational modifications observed on the amino-terminal tails of histones. Similar studies have implicated these and other epigenetic factors in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (e.g., UTX, ARID1A, MLL, MLL3), head and neck squamous cell cancers (e.g., EZH2, MLL2), and myeloid malignancies (e.g., IDH1/2, TET2, DNMT3A, EZH2) (4–7). The prevalence of genetic changes affecting transcription factors and chromatin-modifying genes highlights the central role of transcriptional dysregulation in tumorigenesis.  The EZH2 gene encodes a SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferase that, along with EED, SUZ12, RbAp48, and AEBP2, forms the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (8, 9). EZH2 is responsible for the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27), which is generally associated with transcriptional repression when present in the di- or trimethylated state (8–11). EZH2 is highly expressed in pro-B cells and progressively decreases in expression as cells progress into pre-B cells, immature B cells, and recirculating B cells (12). EZH2 expression is required in the bone marrow for progression of pro-B cells into pre-B cells and immature B cells, because genetic inactivation of EZH2 leads to an accumulation of cells at the pro–B-cell stage (12). However, if EZH2 is inactivated after the pro–B-cell stage, additional maturation steps are not hindered, suggesting that EZH2 functions early in B-cell differentiation (12). In fact, multiple groups have shown that EZH2 plays an important role in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells (13, 14). In particular, EZH2 overexpression in HSCs leads to continued self-renewal capacity in serial transplantation models, suggesting that EZH2 contributes to repopulating potential and helps cells resist replicative stress (13).  EZH2 is frequently amplified and/or overexpressed in most solid tumor types (15); however, this does not appear to be the case in lymphomas, perhaps attributable to the high basal expression of EZH2 in normal proliferating B cells. Instead, EZH2 has been reported to harbor recurrent mutations of the tyrosine 641 (Y641) residue in 22% of germinal center B-cell (GCB) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and 7% of follicular lymphomas (FLs) (3). Although initially reported to be a loss-of-function mutation (3), subsequent biochemical work demonstrated a unique gain-of-function activity for Y641 mutant EZH2 (16, 17). Although WT EZH2 exhibits a strong preference for unmethylated (H3K27me0) and monomethylated H3K27 (H3K27me1) substrates, the Y641 mutants observed in lymphomas (Y641F/N/S/H/C) exhibit profoundly increased activity for dimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me2), decreased activity for H3K27me1, and little to no activity for H3K27me0 (16, 17). Through the coordinated activities of WT and mutant EZH2, there is a global increase in trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) in Y641 mutant lymphomas concomitant with a decrease in H3K27me1 and H3K27me2 (16).  These EZH2 Y641 mutations, along with EZH2 overexpression in many tumors, suggest that dysregulation of H3K27me3 is important in human tumorigenesis. Indeed, H3K27me3 levels correlate with progression-free survival in renal cell carcinoma (18) and with disease severity and poor tumor differentiation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (19). In addition to mutation of EZH2 Y641, alternative mechanisms for dysregulation of H3K27me3 include inactivating mutations of the H3K27 demethylase UTX (4, 20, 21) and overexpression of EZH2 attributable to multiple mechanisms, including decreased miR-101 levels (22, 23), aberrant E2F activity (24), and chromosomal amplification (25).  Through the investigation of global H3K27me3 levels in more than 100 cancer cell lines, we identified a unique EZH2 mutation at the A677 residue that is capable of increasing global H3K27me3 levels when exogenously expressed in cells. Characterization of this mutant protein revealed that exchange of A677 for glycine (A677G) leads to increased activity with H3K27me2 substrates similar to the Y641 EZH2 mutations. However, in contrast to the Y641 mutants, which lose activity with H3K27me0 substrates, this substitution retains critical interactions present in WT EZH2 leading to efficient utilization of all three methylation substrates (H3K27me0, H3K27me1, and H3K27me2). This mutation presents a unique approach for cells to dysregulate H3K27 methylation without requiring cooperation with WT EZH2 as is the case for Y641 EZH2 mutants.  Go to: RESULTS Aberrantly Elevated H3K27me3 Levels in Human Lymphoma Cell Lines. A variety of activating and inactivating mutations of EZH2 have been described in primary tumors derived from GCB DLBCLs, FLs, and myelodysplastic syndrome (1–3, 26–28). The end result of these mutations is increased or decreased methylation of H3K27 (16, 17, 26, 28). To characterize alterations of H3K27me3 in human cancer cell lines, we quantified global H3K27me3 and total histone H3 levels by ELISA in 111 cell lines from seven unique tumor types (Fig. 1A). The methylation-specific antibody was confirmed to be highly specific for H3K27me3 under these assay conditions through titration of full-length recombinant methylated histones and competition of signal from a protein lysate with methylated peptides (Fig. S1 A and B). Each of the tumor types examined exhibited a range of H3K27me3 levels, with several lymphoma cell lines possessing H3K27me3 levels two- to threefold higher than the highest nonlymphoma cell lines. Western blot analysis of protein lysates from several of these cell lines with antibodies specific for H3K27me3, H3K27me2, and H3K27me1 revealed an apparent imbalance between the methylation states of H3K27 (Fig. 1B and Fig. S2). Overall, lymphoma cell lines with elevated H3K27me3 appear to have increased trimethylation at the expense of dimethylation and monomethylation, because H3K27me2 levels and H3K27me1 levels, to a lesser extent, were reduced in these cell lines relative to those with lower global H3K27me3 levels.  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. A subset of lymphoma cell lines exhibits elevated H3K27me3 levels. (A) Global H3K27me3 levels (normalized to total H3) were determined for 111 cancer cell lines from seven different cancer types using H3K27me3 and total H3 ELISAs. Lymphoma cell lines ... Mutation of the A677 Residue of EZH2 to Glycine in a Lymphoma Cell Line with Aberrantly Elevated H3K27me3. Based on recent findings demonstrating an H3K27 hypertrimethylation phenotype in lymphoma cells harboring mutation of the Y641 residue of EHZ2 to either phenylalanine (F), asparagine (N), serine (S), histidine (H), or cysteine (C), we hypothesized that the lymphoma cell lines with the highest levels of H3K27me3 may harbor activating mutations in EZH2. Sanger sequencing of all cell lines for the Y641 codon revealed activating mutations for six of the top seven lymphoma types when ranked by global H3K27me3 levels (Fig. 1A).  The one cell line with high H3K27me3 levels that was not mutated at Y641 was the Pfeiffer cell line. That cell line was established in 1992 from the pleural effusion of a patient in the leukemic phase of DLBCL (29). Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA for all EZH2 coding exons revealed a heterozygous C-to-G mutation at nucleotide 2045, leading to a nonsynonymous mutation of the A677 residue to a glycine (A677G) (Fig. 2A). Sequence analysis of cDNA revealed that both WT and mutant alleles are expressed (Fig. S3). This residue falls within the catalytic SET domain of EZH2 and is located in exon 18 two exons downstream of the Y641 residue (Fig. 2B). This residue is highly conserved across multiple species and multiple histone methyltransferases (Fig. 2C), indicating that it may play an essential role in the function of EZH2.  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. The Pfeiffer lymphoma cell line harbors a heterozygous A677G mutation in EZH2. (A) Chromatograms from Sanger sequencing of EZH2 in a WT control sample, the Pfeiffer DLBCL cell line, and a primary DLBCL patient sample (sample ID CD564308). Heterozygous ... Occurrence of the A677G EZH2 Mutation in Primary Lymphoma Samples. To establish whether the mutation identified in the Pfeiffer cell line occurs in primary human lymphomas, this residue was sequenced in a panel of 41 lymphoma specimens. This panel consisted of 30 DLBCLs, six FLs, one mantle cell lymphoma, one extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, one splenic marginal zone lymphoma, and two Waldenström macroglobulinemia or lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas (Table S1). In addition to four occurrences of the Y641 mutation (1 Y641N, 1 Y641F, 1 Y641H, and 1Y641C), nonsynonymous missense mutations were observed at P488 (P488S) and A677 (A677G). The A677 mutation was heterozygous and occurred in a stage IIE DLBCL obtained from a 74-y-old woman (Fig. 2A and Table S1). These data confirm that the A677G mutation occurs in primary human lymphoma and is not simply an artifact of cell culture.  EZH2 A677G Mutation Confers Biochemical Activity Independent of H3K27 Methylation State. Given the hypertrimethylation phenotype in cells bearing the A677G mutation and the spatial proximity of A677 to Y641 in our structural models (vide infra), we tested in vitro whether A677G EZH2 displayed an altered substrate specificity similar to Y641 mutants (Fig. 3 and Table S2). When comparing turnover and catalytic efficiency with the H3K27 peptide substrates (kcat and kcat/Km, respectively), WT EZH2 loses activity when progressively more methyl groups are incorporated into H3K27 (i.e., H3K27me0 > H3K27me1 > H3K27me2), with the ratio of catalytic efficiencies for H3K27me0, H3K27me1, and H3K27me2 being 9:6:1. In contrast, all Y641 mutant enzymes that were evaluated (Y641F/N/S/H/C) displayed the opposite trend, with the H3K27me2 peptide being used most efficiently (H3K27me0:me1:me2 kcat/Km ratio = 1:2:13). These substrate preferences are consistent with recently reported data demonstrating H3K27me0:me1:me2 kcat/Km ratios of 13:4:1 and 1:2:22 for WT and Y641F EZH2, respectively (16). The A677G EZH2 complex, on the other hand, displayed a profile different from both WT and Y641 mutants. A677G EZH2 used all three substrates with nearly equal efficiency (H3K27me0:me1:me2 kcat/Km ratio = 1.1:0.6:1) and at a rate comparable to the highest turnover rate observed with the WT enzyme (kcat = 0.84 min−1 for A677G with H3K27me0 vs. 1.01 min−1 for WT with H3K27me0). When nucleosomes purified from HeLa cells were evaluated, the activity of A677G EZH2 was slightly higher than WT EZH2 and the Y641 mutants (kcat = 0.19 min−1 for A677G vs. 0.11 min−1 for WT and 0.15 min−1 for Y641S), likely attributable to the ability of the A677G EZH2 complex to act on a greater proportion of the HeLa histones, which are heterogeneously modified at H3K27.  Fig. 3. Fig. 3. A677G EZH2 mutant exhibits a unique substrate specificity. Enzyme turnover number [kcat (min−1)], the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate was half of Vmax [Km (μM)], and catalytic efficiency [kcat/Km (μM−1 ... To determine whether the A677G mutation might affect EZH2 specificity toward other histone substrates, we also evaluated WT and mutant EZH2 complexes using a library of 602 peptides representing sequences within histones H2A, H2B, H3, or H4 and possessing up to five posttranslational modifications, such as lysine and/or arginine methylation; lysine acetylation; or phosphorylation of serine, tyrosine, and/or threonine (Dataset S1). This global analysis revealed that the A677G mutant EZH2 did not enhance activity for any other histone sites compared with WT EZH2 (Fig. S4A). In addition, when comparing the A677G mutant with the Y641N mutant, it was observed that their only common activity was with a peptide containing H3K27me2 (Fig. S4B). Thus, the A677G EZH2 complex is unique in that it has both retained WT activities with unmodified and monomethylated substrates and acquired the neomorphic activity observed in Y641 EZH2 mutants with dimethylated substrates.  Expression of A677G EZH2 Is Sufficient to Drive Hypertrimethylation of H3K27. To explore the effect of the A677G and Y641 EZH2 mutants on histone methylation levels, WT and mutant versions of EZH2 were transiently expressed in cells before evaluation of global H3K27me3 levels. MCF-7 cells were selected for this analysis because they are WT for EZH2, exhibit relatively low levels of H3K27me3 (26% of Pfeiffer H3K27me3 levels; Fig. 1A), and are easily transfected. Consistent with the biochemical data, exogenous expression of either A677G or Y641 mutant EZH2 increased H3K27me3 levels 1.9- to 2.8-fold relative to the empty vector control (Fig. 4 A and B). H3K27me2, on the other hand, was depleted in cells expressing A677G or Y641 mutant EZH2. H3K27me1 levels were not significantly affected by expression of either WT or mutant EZH2. These observations are consistent with those from EZH2 WT and mutant lymphoma cell lines, where the A677G and Y641 EZH2 mutant cell lines exhibit increased H3K27me3, decreased H3K27me2, and modest effects on H3K27me1 (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate that expression of A677G EZH2 is sufficient to induce a global hypertrimethylation of the H3K27 residue similar to Y641 mutants.  Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Exogenous expression of A677G EZH2 stimulates trimethylation of H3K27 at the expense of H3K27me2. (A) MCF-7 breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with mammalian expression constructs encoding either a WT or mutant form of EZH2. In addition, ... Go to: DISCUSSION Disruption of the normal patterning of H3K27me3 occurs in human cancers (30–32) and appears to be required for the proliferation of some lymphoma cells because knockdown of EZH2 in the SU-DHL-4 DLBCL cell line results in growth arrest at the G1/S transition (33). Recent studies have demonstrated that one common mechanism for the H3K27 hypertrimethylation phenotype in lymphoma is mutation of the EZH2 Y641 residue (1, 3, 16, 17). Herein, we have reported the identification and characterization of a unique EZH2 mutation equally capable of increasing global H3K27me3 in human lymphoma cells.  In the absence of an EZH2 crystal structure, a homology model was constructed to understand the distinct substrate specificities of WT, A677G, and Y641 mutant forms of EZH2. The models were based on the protein sequence of EZH2 and a crystal structure of GLP/EHMT1 bound to a histone H3 peptide substrate containing H3K9me2 (Fig. 5A). The homology model of WT EZH2 is consistent with the biochemical data, demonstrating that it primarily catalyzes mono- and dimethylation, but not trimethylation, of H3K27 (Fig. 3 and Table S2). Similar to other methyltransferases, such as Set7/9, the hydroxyl group of the highly conserved EZH2 Y641 residue appears to optimally orient the unmethylated and monomethylated forms of the H3K27 substrate for methyl transfer through a hydrogen bond with the ε-amine group of H3K27 (34, 35). However, with ∼3.3 Å between the hydroxyl oxygen of Y641 and the ε-amine group of H3K27me2, the model shows very little room for the dimethylated lysine to rotate into position to accept a third methyl group. Therefore, the Y641 residue of EZH2 appears to have a dual purpose, participating in the orientation of the unmethylated and monomethylated lysine and, at the same time, sterically restricting activity with a dimethylated substrate.  Fig. 5. Fig. 5. Y641 and A677G EZH2 mutations alter the lysine binding pocket to affect H3K27 substrate specificity. A homology model of WT EZH2 was generated using the crystal structure of GLP/EHMT1 bound to an H3K9me2 peptide substrate as described in SI Materials ... This model further predicts that the mutation of Y641 to a significantly smaller residue, such as asparagine (Y641N), would result in a larger lysine tunnel (H3K27me2 ε-amine–to-N641 side-chain distance of at least 4.7 Å) and loss of the critical tyrosine hydroxyl-to–ε-amine hydrogen bond (Fig. 5B). These changes presumably weaken stabilization of the highly flexible unmodified or monomethylated lysine, whereas the larger lysine tunnel permits the dimethylated lysine to rotate into position for the third methyl transfer. Although the Y641N, Y641S, and Y641C mutations dramatically decrease the size of the residue at position 641, the mutation of Y641 to a phenylalanine (Y641F) is relatively conservative, with only loss of the tyrosine hydroxyl group (Fig. 5C). Modeling of the Y641F EZH2 suggests that loss of the hydroxyl group may allow the phenylalanine residue to adopt an alternative low-energy conformation in which it rotates away from the lysine tunnel toward the A677 residue. This second conformation likely generates sufficient space (H3K27me2 ε-amine–to-F641 side-chain distance of at least 4.0 Å) for the dimethylated lysine to orient optimally for the third methyl transfer. However, with the loss of the stabilizing hydrogen bond that occurs between the tyrosine hydroxyl group and the lysine substrate, the Y641F mutant exhibits greatly reduced activity with unmodified lysines. This interpretation is consistent with data presented in this report and by others (16, 17) demonstrating that Y641 mutants do not efficiently use unmethylated lysines yet have acquired robust activity with dimethylated substrates (Fig. 3 and Table S2).  Interestingly, although the structural model for WT EZH2 suggests that the highly conserved A677 residue does not interact directly with either H3K27 or [3H]-S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), it is in close proximity to the hydroxyl group of Y641 with a distance of ∼3.3 Å (Fig. 5A). It is therefore predicted that mutating A677 to a smaller glycine residue permits Y641 to adopt an alternative low-energy conformation similar to that predicted for the phenylalanine in the Y641F mutant (Fig. 5 C and D). This alternative conformation for Y641 produces sufficient space (at least 4.6 Å) between the hydroxyl oxygen of Y641 and the ε-amine group of H3K27me2 to permit the lysine tail to rotate into position for trimethylation. However, in contrast to the Y641F mutant, the A677G mutant retains the tyrosine hydroxyl group at position 641, thus preserving the stabilizing interaction between Y641 and unmodified lysine substrates. This model therefore suggests that the retention of the Y641 residue, combined with the ability of this residue to adopt an alternative conformation in the A677G mutant, contributes to the efficient methylation of unmodified, mono- and dimethylated substrates (Fig. 3 and Table S2).  Although the EZH2 Y641 mutation occurs in 22% of GCB DLBCLs and 7% of FLs (3), our study indicates that mutation of the EZH2 A677 to glycine is a fairly rare event. We observed this mutation in 1 of 50 lymphoma cell lines and 1 of 41 primary lymphoma samples. Morin et al. (1) also recently observed a single case of DLBCL (a 63-y-old woman with stage IAE) with an A677G mutation among 127 samples that were assessed by RNA-seq, exome-seq, and/or genome-seq. Although a matched normal sample was not available for the A677G EZH2 mutant lymphoma specimen reported in this study, the mutation was reported to be somatic in the case reported by Morin et al. (1), and it is not reported as a normal sequence variant in the dbSNP database or the 1000 Genomes project. Thus, although a more extensive study with focused genotyping of the A677 codon will be required to establish the true incidence of this alteration, these initial data suggest that the frequency of this mutation is likely below 2–3%.  Considering that the end result of these two mutations may be quite similar (i.e., increased H3K27me3), it is at first somewhat surprising that these mutations occur at such different rates. However, this discrepancy might be explained, in part, by the spectrum of possible activating mutations at each site. To date, mutation of Y641 to any of five different residues (F, N, S, C, or H) has been reported to increase activity with an H3K27me2 substrate (refs. 1, 3, 16, 17, 36 and this study). This increased activity has been attributed to the exchange of Y641 for smaller residues, which permit the larger H3K27me2 substrate to rotate into a position for methyl transfer. The A677G mutation appears to increase the dimensions of the lysine tunnel similarly by permitting an alternate conformation of Y641 through exchange of alanine for a smaller amino acid; however, because alanine is already the second smallest amino acid, it may only be exchanged for a glycine. At the nucleotide level, only one of nine single-nucleotide mutations within the A677 codon will result in a glycine residue. In contrast, five of nine single-nucleotide mutations within the Y641 codon generate a gain-of-function mutant. Thus, the apparently low incidence of the EZH2 A677G mutation may be attributable in part to the extremely limited number of possible alterations for this particular site.  The fact that the SET domain is highly conserved across orthologous and homologous methyltransferases readily permits translation of findings from one methyltransferase to another. For example, the effect of changes at the Y641 residue of EZH2 is predictable based on mutational analyses of other SET domain methyltransferases whose biochemical properties have been more extensively studied. The human SET7/9 methyltransferase normally monomethylates H3K4; however, when the SET7/9 Y245 residue (the equivalent of EZH2 Y641) is mutated to alanine, the mutant can no longer modify an H3K4me0 substrate but, instead, gains the ability to di- and trimethylate an H3K4me1 peptide substrate (37). Similarly, exchange of the Y641 equivalent in the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a (Y1067) for phenylalanine converts the enzyme from a mono- and dimethyltransferase to a trimethyltransferase (38).  This study examines the biochemical and cellular activity of the conserved A677 residue of EZH2. Interestingly, the structurally related SET domain-containing DIM-5 from Neurospora crassa has a glycine at the equivalent position (Fig. 2C) and has been reported to perform all three methylation events on its H3K9 substrate (39, 40). Thus, it appears that the alanine at residue 677 of EZH2, and likely equivalent residues in other SET domain methyltransferases, plays an important role in the regulation of substrate specificity without being in direct contact with the substrate. This interplay between Y641 and A677 in EZH2 highlights just one of the many important mechanisms that have likely evolved to regulate the substrate and product specificities of lysine methyltransferases.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS All cell lines were obtained from either the American Type Culture Collection or Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen and maintained in the recommended cell culture media. Primary tissue and DNA samples were obtained from OriGene (Table S1). Global histone modification levels were determined with ELISA or Western blot methods using antibodies specific for total histone H3, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, or H3K27me3 (Figs. S1 and S2). The full-length EZH2 sequence was determined for genomic DNA and cDNA using primers described in Table S3 and standard Sanger sequencing methods. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with WT and mutant EZH2 expression constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biochemical studies were performed with peptide and HeLa nucleosomes using [3H]-SAM and purified recombinant five-member PRC2 complexes containing WT or mutant forms of EZH2 (Fig. S5 and Table S4). Structural models of EZH2 were built using GLP/EHMT1 bound to an H3K9me2 peptide substrate (Protein Data Bank ID code 2RFI) as a primary template and structurally compared with other related SET domain-containing histone lysine methyltransferases with determined crystal structures.

1151||Heterozygous somatic mutations in the spliceosome gene U2AF1 occur in ~11% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the most common adult myeloid malignancy. It is unclear how these mutations contribute to disease. We examined in vivo hematopoietic consequences of the most common U2AF1 mutation using a doxycycline-inducible transgenic mouse model. Mice expressing mutant U2AF1(S34F) display altered hematopoiesis and changes in pre-mRNA splicing in hematopoietic progenitor cells by whole transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq). Integration with human RNA-seq datasets determined that common mutant U2AF1-induced splicing alterations are enriched in RNA processing genes, ribosomal genes, and recurrently-mutated MDS and acute myeloid leukemia-associated genes. These findings support the hypothesis that mutant U2AF1 alters downstream gene isoform expression, thereby contributing to abnormal hematopoiesis in MDS patients.  Keywords: U2AF1, splicing, myelodysplastic syndrome Go to: INTRODUCTION Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common myeloid malignancy of the elderly, with at least 10,000 new cases occurring in the United States annually (Ma, 2012). MDS are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by peripheral blood cytopenias, with up to 30% of patients progressing to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Troy et al., 2014). Mutations in spliceosome genes have been identified in over half of MDS patient bone marrow samples, making it the most common class of genes mutated in MDS (Damm et al., 2012; Graubert et al., 2011; Papaemmanuil et al., 2011; Thol et al., 2012; Visconte et al., 2011; Walter et al., 2013; Yoshida et al., 2011). The recurrently-mutated spliceosome genes encode factors that are involved in the recognition of the 3′-intronic splice site and are mutually exclusive of one another in patient samples (Haferlach et al., 2014; Papaemmanuil et al., 2013; Walter et al., 2013; Yoshida et al., 2011), implying that they may contribute similarly to MDS pathogenesis or, alternatively, may not be tolerated by a cell when they co-occur.  Our group and others identified mutations in U2AF1 (U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1) in 11% of MDS patients, making it one of the most commonly mutated genes in this disease (Graubert et al., 2011; Yoshida et al., 2011). In addition, U2AF1 mutations typically occur in the founding clone, suggesting they may play an important role in disease initiation (Haferlach et al., 2014; Papaemmanuil et al., 2013; Walter et al., 2013). U2AF1 mutations have also been identified across major cancer types, including AML, lung adenocarcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast adenocarcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma, further implicating U2AF1 broadly in cancer pathogenesis (Kandoth et al., 2013). During normal pre-mRNA splicing activity, the U2AF1 protein binds to the AG dinucleotide at the 3′ end of the intron, thereby assisting its cofactor U2AF2 in recruitment of the U2 snRNP for spliceosome activation as part of the spliceosome E/A complex (Wahl et al., 2009; Wu et al., 1999).  It is unknown how U2AF1 mutations contribute to MDS pathogenesis. Several groups have reported splicing changes in cells expressing mutant U2AF1, including cell lines (HeLa, K562), primary human CD34+ cells, and patient AML and MDS cells (Brooks et al., 2014; Graubert et al., 2011; Ilagan et al., 2014; Okeyo-Owuor et al., 2014; Przychodzen et al., 2013; Yoshida et al., 2011). However, the downstream targets of mutant U2AF1 identified in these studies are variable, perhaps due to differences in cell types, co-occurring mutations, and experimental methods used. Initial in vivo studies using a retroviral overexpression model showed that mouse bone marrow cells expressing mutant U2AF1 have reduced repopulation ability (Yoshida et al., 2011). Together, these data lead us to hypothesize that mutant U2AF1-induced splicing alterations and subsequent changes in gene isoform expression result in abnormal hematopoiesis.  Go to: RESULTS Splicing is altered in primary human AML cells expressing mutant U2AF1  To examine the effects of U2AF1 mutations on global splicing in primary patient samples, we utilized RNA-seq data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML cohort (Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2013). We identified 8 samples with a spliceosome gene mutation, including 6 samples with a U2AF1 mutation affecting the S34 amino acid (4 S34F, 2 S34Y), 1 sample with U2AF1(Q157P), 1 sample with SF3B1(K700E), and 102 samples without a mutation or copy number alteration in spliceosome genes (Table S1). Unsupervised clustering using the splicing ratio of cassette and mutually exclusive exon splice junctions segregated the 6 mutant U2AF1(S34) patient samples from the 102 control, the U2AF1(Q157P), and SF3B1(K700E) samples (Figure 1), indicating that splicing is distinctly altered in primary patient cells with U2AF1 mutations affecting the S34 amino acid.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Global alterations in pre-mRNA splicing are distinct in human AML patients with U2AF1 mutations Generation of U2AF1(S34F) transgenic mice  To study the in vivo consequences of U2AF1 mutations on splicing and hematopoiesis in an isolated genetic system and to prioritize splicing alterations identified in primary patient samples, we created a mouse model to study the most abundant U2AF1 mutation found in MDS patients [U2AF1(S34F)]. Using a previously-validated, single-copy, site-specific integration approach (Beard et al., 2006), we generated doxycycline-inducible U2AF1(S34F) and control U2AF1(WT) transgenic mice. We integrated human cDNA (human and mouse U2AF1 proteins differ in only one amino acid in the polyglycine tract of the C-terminal RS domain) coding for U2AF1(S34F) or U2AF1(WT) into the Col1a1 locus of KH2 mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (Figure S1A). KH2 ES cells contain the M2rtTA tetracycline-responsive transactivator protein (rtTA) ubiquitously expressed from the Rosa26 locus, which allows for induction of the integrated U2AF1(S34F) or U2AF1(WT) transgene following treatment of cells with the tetracycline derivative doxycycline (Figure 2A). Integration was validated in both mouse lines by Southern blot analysis (Figure 2B). These transgenic mouse lines display dose-dependent, inducible, in vivo expression of the integrated U2AF1 transgene (S34F or WT) in bone marrow cells (Figure 2C). For subsequent experiments, we used a doxycycline dose (625 ppm doxycycline chow) that induced levels of exogenous transgene expression similar to endogenous mouse U2af1 levels in bone marrow cells, consistent with the heterozygous expression of U2AF1 mutations in MDS patient bone marrow samples (Graubert et al., 2011). This dose of doxycycline induced similar levels of transgene expression in U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA and U2AF1(WT)/rtTA double transgenic mice, as determined by pyrosequencing (data not shown). U2AF1(WT) and U2AF1(S34F) expression was in excess of normal mouse U2af1 expression levels, resulting in approximately double the normal protein level in cells (Figure S1B); however, overexpression of human U2AF1 transgene(s) at this dose of doxycycline has no impact on endogenous mouse U2af1 expression (Figure S1C). U2AF1 transgene expression was induced in myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages, as well as in stem and progenitor cells (Figure S1D).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Generation of doxycycline-inducible U2AF1 transgenic mice Hematopoietic cell lineage is altered in U2AF1(S34F)-recipient mice  To examine the cell-autonomous effects of mutant U2AF1(S34F) expression on hematopoiesis, we transplanted transgenic mouse bone marrow into lethally-irradiated wild-type congenic recipient mice, allowing for ≥6 weeks of engraftment prior to induction of the transgene. Initial experiments were conducted with all six possible genotypes produced from transgenic colonies. Control genotypes of wild-type (nontransgenic) mice, single transgenic rtTA-only, U2AF1(WT)-only, and U2AF1(S34F)-only, and double transgenic U2AF1(WT)/rtTA mice were similar in parameters measured (Figure S2A). Given the similarity of all controls, subsequent experiments were performed with the U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA double transgenic mice and two control genotypes: U2AF1(WT)/rtTA double transgenic mice and single transgenic rtTA-only mice [littermates from the U2AF1(S34F) transgenic mouse colony].  Examination of hematopoietic compartments in recipient mice following one month of doxycycline to induce transgene expression revealed a reduction in peripheral blood total white blood cell (WBC) counts in U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-recipient mice compared to U2AF1(WT)/rtTA-and rtTA-only recipient controls (4.3 vs 7.11 and 7.13 K/μl, respectively, p=0.014) (Figure 3A), but no difference in red blood cell parameters or platelet counts (Figure S2B). This peripheral blood leukopenia was stable and persisted for up to 12 months (Figure 3A); it was also dependent on mutant U2AF1 expression, since the WBC counts in mutant U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA mice recovered to levels similar to U2AF1(WT)/rtTA mice after halting doxycycline treatment, even after 6 months of transgene expression (Figure S2C). Flow cytometry analysis of mature lineage cells in the peripheral blood revealed a reduction in B cells and monocytes in U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-recipient mice compared to controls (Figure 3B).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Mature hematopoietic cell lineages are altered by in vivo expression of U2AF1(S34F) There were no differences in bone marrow cellularity or spleen weights in U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA mice compared to controls (Figure S2D). However, mature cell lineage distribution was altered in the bone marrow of U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-recipient mice after one month of doxycycline. Both monocytes and B cells were reduced in U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-recipient mouse bone marrow, and neutrophils were increased (Figure 3C). The reduction of monocytes in the bone marrow of U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-recipient mice occurred as soon as five days after transgene induction (Figure S2E) and was associated with an increase in Annexin V+ and phospho-H2AX staining of monocytes (Figure 3D). In vitro culture of transgenic mouse bone marrow revealed a similar trend in Annexin V+ and phospho-H2AX flow cytometry in U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-expressing cells compared to controls (Figure S2F). There was no evidence of bone marrow dysplasia in U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-recipient mice (Figure S2G). The overall survival of U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA- and U2AF1(WT)/rtTA-recipient mice was similar (Figure S2H), and mutant mice did not develop MDS or AML after at least one year of continuous doxycycline.  U2AF1(S34F)-recipient mice have increased progenitor cells in bone marrow and spleen, but stem cells have a competitive disadvantage in repopulation assays  Following one month of doxycycline to induce transgene expression, U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-recipient mice displayed an increased frequency of myeloid progenitors in both bone marrow (Figure 4A) and spleen (Figure 4B) by progenitor colony forming assay (CFU-C) compared to U2AF1(WT)/rtTA and rtTA-only recipient control mice. This increase was also seen by flow cytometry analysis for c-Kit+/lineage− (KL) cells in the bone marrow (Figure S3A), as well as for common myeloid progenitors (CMP) in bone marrow (Figure 4C) and spleen (Figure 4D) of U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-recipient mice compared to controls. Granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) were variably increased (Figure S3B) and megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEP) were unchanged in mutant mice compared to controls (Figure S3C).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Hematopoietic stem-enriched and progenitor cells are increased by in vivo expression of U2AF1(S34F), but have a competitive disadvantage in repopulation assays Flow cytometry for the stem cell-enriched compartment defined by c-Kit+/lineage−/Sca-1+ (KLS) cells also showed an increase in the bone marrow of U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-recipient mice compared to controls (Figure 4E) following one month of doxycycline. Further characterization of stem cells by flow cytometry using SLAM and CD34/Flk2 revealed a trend toward increased multipotent progenitors, but no difference in short-term and long-term stem cell populations (Figure S3D). The increase in bone marrow stem-enriched and progenitor cells (KLS, KL, CMP) measured by flow cytometry and by CFU-C in U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-recipient mice was detectable following only 5 days of doxycycline exposure (Figure S3E–H). The increased frequency of KLS cells after 5 days of transgene induction was associated with increased Ki67+ staining in KLS cells from U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-recipient mice compared to controls (Figure 4F); a similar trend was seen for BrdU incorporation (Figure S3I). There was no increase in hematopoietic stem-enriched and progenitor cells measured by flow cytometry and methylcellulose in the absence of doxycycline in U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-recipient mice (Figure S3E, G, H), confirming this early phenotype at 5 days was not due to doxycycline-independent transgene expression. Next, we evaluated stem cell function using a competitive repopulation assay. Although we observed an increase in the frequency of stem-enriched and progenitor cells in mutant U2AF1-recipient mice, competitive repopulation assays revealed a disadvantage for U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA-expressing stem cells compared to U2AF1(WT)/rtTA-expressing cells in primary recipient mice (Figure 4G). The competitive disadvantage was sustained when the bone marrow from primary recipients was transplanted into secondary and tertiary recipient mice (Figure 4H).  Comprehensive RNA sequencing of U2AF1(S34F)-expressing mouse bone marrow progenitors reveals splicing alterations  MDS patient bone marrow samples have an increased fraction of common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) compared to normal bone marrow donors (Pang et al., 2013; Woll et al., 2014), and we observed an increase in CMPs in mutant U2AF1 mouse bone marrow as early as 5 days following doxycycline exposure with a concomitant increase in CFU-C formation. Therefore, we sorted donor-derived CMPs from U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA- and U2AF1(WT)/rtTA-recipient mice following 5 days of transgene induction and performed transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to detect U2AF1(S34F)-induced splicing alterations. The levels of transgene induction were similar among samples (Figure S4A). On average, CMP samples yielded 3.2 ×108 sequencing reads (Figure S4B), with an average of 2.0 ×108 uniquely mapped reads across samples (Figure S4C). The distribution of reads from various species of RNA was similar, with mutant samples having a slightly higher percentage of intergenic bases (p<0.05) and lower percentage of coding bases (p=0.05) (Figure S4D).  Unsupervised clustering based on the splicing ratio of cassette and mutually exclusive exon junctions segregated U2AF1(S34F)-expressing CMP samples from U2AF1(WT) controls (Figure 5A), as it did for AML patients (Figure 1). DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010), an algorithm that accounts for RNA-seq replicate data and biologic variation, identified changes in overall gene expression in 128 genes (FDR<0.1) in U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA samples compared to U2AF1(WT)/rtTA controls (Table S2). Using these genes, we performed gene set enrichment and pathway analyses with GOseq (Young et al., 2010) and identified an enrichment of genes involved in immune response and leukocyte activation processes (FDR<0.1) (Table S3).  Figure 5 Figure 5 U2AF1(S34F) expression alters splicing in mouse progenitors cells in vivo DEXSeq (Anders et al., 2012), an algorithm that identifies altered junctions while accounting for changes in overall gene expression, identified 742 splicing junctions that were differentially expressed in 633 genes in U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA samples compared to U2AF1(WT)/rtTA controls (FDR<0.1) (Table S4). Using these 633 genes, we again performed gene set enrichment and pathway analyses and identified an enrichment of genes involved in RNA binding (FDR<0.1) (Figure 5B). The majority of differentially spliced junctions in U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA samples compared to U2AF1(WT)/rtTA controls were classified as cassette exon, simple alternative 3′ splice acceptor site, and coordinate cassette exon events (Figure S4E).  U2AF1(S34F) has altered 3′ splice acceptor sequence preference  To further examine the effects of U2AF1(S34F) expression on splicing in vivo, we determined the consensus sequence flanking the AG dinucleotide at the 3′ splice acceptor site known to be recognized by U2AF1 during splicing (Wu et al., 1999). In contrast to the sequence motif seen in non-dysregulated control junctions (Figure 5C), exons skipped more frequently by mutant U2AF1(S34F) relative to U2AF1(WT) were enriched for uracil (indicated by a T) in the −3 position relative to the AG dinucleotide (Figure 5D). We observed a similar pattern in alternative 3′ splice site usage; there is an enrichment of T in the −3 position of canonical 3′ splice sites whose alternative 3′ splice site was utilized more frequently in mutant U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA samples relative to U2AF1(WT)/rtTA controls (Figure 5E). This pattern is the same as seen in AML patient samples with U2AF1 mutations and in primary human CD34+ cells expressing U2AF1(S34F) or U2AF1(WT), and similar to previously-reported data in human samples (Brooks et al., 2014; Ilagan et al., 2014; Okeyo-Owuor et al., 2014; Przychodzen et al., 2013). These data indicate that the sequence-specific pattern of altered splicing induced by mutant U2AF1 is similar in mouse and human cells.  U2AF1(S34F)-induced splicing changes are enriched in genes involved in RNA processing and splicing, protein translation, and recurrently mutated genes in MDS/AML  To prioritize altered splicing events for further analysis, we intersected significant junctions (DEXSeq; FDR<0.1) across 3 datasets: mouse CMP samples (n=219 junctions), AML patient samples with and without U2AF1 mutations (n=162 junctions), and our previously-described primary human CD34+ cells over-expressing U2AF1(S34F) or U2AF1(WT) (n=1652 junctions) (Okeyo-Owuor et al., 2014). The intersection was (necessarily) composed of homologous junctions and was additionally restricted to include only concordantly dysregulated (same direction of log fold change) junctions; 17 homologous dysregulated junctions (p<0.0001; simulation) were present in 13 genes (Figure 6A, B). Several of the dysregulated junctions corresponded to the same splicing event in a transcript and were identified as reciprocal splice junctions. All of these junctions occur in known isoforms, though the function of most of these isoforms remains largely unknown. Several of these junctions occur in genes mutated in MDS and AML (GNAS, PICALM) (Bejar et al., 2011; Borel et al., 2012) or known to be involved in stem cell biology (H2AFY, MED24) (Buschbeck et al., 2009; Chia et al., 2010; Gaspar-Maia et al., 2013).  Figure 6 Figure 6 Mutant U2AF1 alters splicing in common targets across species To broaden the list of potentially concordant changes across species, we performed a meta-analysis of the three independent datasets using Fisher’s combined probability test (Brown, 1975) and identified 555 significantly dysregulated homologous junctions in 415 genes across all three datasets (FDR<0.1) (Table S5). The larger number of dysregulated junctions relative to the conservative intersection above enables both consensus sequence analysis and pathway/gene-set enrichment analyses. Skipped exons from the Fisher dataset also show an enrichment of T at the −3 position of 3′ splice sites, as in the CMP data (Figure S5). We hypothesized that splicing in biologic pathway(s) could be widely disrupted by mutation of an upstream splicing factor. To test this, we performed gene set enrichment and pathway analyses on the 415 splicing-dysregulated genes using GOseq. This resulted in 28 pathways/categories identified as significant (FDR<0.1, Enrichment >2) by one of the 3 independent analyses of KEGG pathways or GO molecular function (MF) or biological processes (BP) categories:14 of these contain genes involved in RNA processing, RNA splicing, RNA localization/transport, and RNA binding, while 11 were involved in protein translation processes and ribosomal pathways (Table S6). Additionally, spliceosome genes (p=4.68e-08, Table S1) and genes recurrently mutated in MDS and AML (Bejar et al., 2011; Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2013; Haferlach et al., 2014; Papaemmanuil et al., 2013; Walter et al., 2013) (p=0.03, Table S7) were enriched in the 415 splicing-dysregulated genes (Table 1 and Figure 6C). Oncogenes and tumor suppressors (Supek et al., 2014) were also highly represented (p=0.09, data not shown).  Table 1 Table 1 Spliceosome and recurrently mutated MDS/AML genes with dysregulated splicing (Fisher FDR<0.1). U2AF1(S34F)-induced splicing changes are present in human MDS bone marrow samples  Next, we examined MDS patient bone marrow samples for mutant U2AF1-induced splicing changes discovered by RNA-seq analysis in a subset of affected genes. Dysregulated splicing events were prioritized for validation by overlap in the 3 datasets, splicing ratio change, or known biological function of the gene, with particular focus on genes mutated in MDS. Mutant U2AF1-induced splice isoform changes identified by RNA-seq analysis were concordant with RT-PCR of MDS patient bone marrow samples for 7 of 8 splicing events examined, including H2AFY, BCOR, PICALM, GNAS, KDM6A, KMT2D (MLL2), and MED24; only EIF4A2 showed no difference (Figure 7 and data not shown).  Figure 7 Figure 7 Mutant U2AF1 alters splicing in MDS bone marrow cells Go to: DISCUSSION In this study, we provide evidence that mutant U2AF1 expression alters hematopoiesis and pre-mRNA splicing in the primary hematopoietic progenitor cells of mice. U2AF1(S34F) expression in mice results in leukopenia and changes in the distribution of mature hematopoietic lineages in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. In addition, U2AF1(S34F) expression increases the frequency of progenitor cells in the bone marrow and spleen of mice and the frequency of progenitor cell cycling in the bone marrow. We identify U2AF1(S34F)-specific changes in splice isoforms in 633 genes in mouse common myeloid progenitors. Finally, through an integrative meta-analysis of 3 unique RNA-seq datasets, we identify splice junctions consistently altered across species by mutant U2AF1 expression and that are enriched in RNA processing genes, translational processes/ribosomal genes, and recurrently mutated genes in MDS/AML. Collectively, these results suggest that U2AF1(S34F)-induced alternative splicing may contribute to the altered hematopoiesis that is characteristic of MDS patients.  Mutant U2AF1(S34F) mice display several phenotypes associated with MDS, including leukopenia, increased apoptosis of maturing cells in the bone marrow, and progenitor cell expansion (Catenacci and Schiller, 2005; Hamblin, 1992; Pang et al., 2013; Raza et al., 1995a; Raza et al., 1995b; Shetty et al., 2000; Troy et al., 2014; Woll et al., 2014; Yoshida, 1993). However, these mice do not show dysplasia, nor do they develop MDS or AML. Similar to another genetic mouse model of MDS mutations (ASXL1) (Abdel-Wahab et al., 2013), mutant U2AF1(S34F)-expressing stem cells appear to have a competitive disadvantage and increased apoptosis compared to wild-type cells, highlighting a conundrum for MDS biology: how is clonal dominance achieved by a cell containing mutation(s) that result in reduced competitiveness and increased apoptosis? Although U2AF1 mutations are typically early genetic events, they may occur in cells already harboring a mutation that is permissive for clonal expansion. Cooperativity studies with significantly co-occurring mutations, such as del(20) or ASXL1 mutations (Bacher et al., 2014; Damm et al., 2012; Papaemmanuil et al., 2013; Walter et al., 2013) (or with other common mutations in MDS, like those in TET2 or DNMT3A), may be necessary to determine whether U2AF1 mutations require a specific genetic context to cause MDS or AML. Ultimately, U2AF1 mutations may contribute to ineffective hematopoiesis that is typical in MDS, while other mutations confer clonal dominance. This mouse model could be used to address these questions.  In this study, we show U2AF1(S34F)-induced splicing alterations in primary hematopoietic cells in an isolated genetic system in vivo. By using primary mouse CMPs and human CD34+ cells, we capitalize on identifying early splicing changes that are induced by mutant U2AF1 expression in the absence of transformation. Importantly, expression of mutant U2AF1 in mouse bone marrow cells results in an altered 3′ splice acceptor site sequence preference that is identical to the pattern observed in human cells, suggesting that the same mechanism of altered splicing is conserved across species and credentialing the mouse model for mechanistic studies.  We have identified a list of consistently altered candidate genes that may contribute to myeloid disease pathogenesis. Comparison of these datasets with dysregulated junctions found in lung adenocarcinoma patient samples with U2AF1 mutations suggests that at least some genes with altered splicing are shared across cancer and cell types harboring U2AF1 mutations; indeed, 13 of 29 genes with significant alterations associated with U2AF1 mutations in both lung adenocarcinoma and AML are also present in our list of junctions identified by meta-analysis (Brooks et al., 2014).  Further studies will be needed to identify the consequences of mutant U2AF1-induced splicing alterations for hematopoiesis and myeloid disease. It is still unknown if the contribution of U2AF1 mutations to MDS pathology involves pre-mRNA splicing alterations of one, a select few, or many genes of interest. Future rescue experiments using target mRNAs/shRNAs to alter isoform expression in mice will be necessary to address this question. However, the observation that dysregulated splicing junctions induced by mutant U2AF1(S34F) are enriched in recurrently-mutated genes in MDS/AML raises the possibility that subtle changes in isoform expression in one or more genes may contribute to mutant U2AF1-associated disease. Changes in isoform expression of cancer-associated genes may have important consequences for a cell. For example, different isoforms of NRAS have been shown to activate different signaling molecules, and expression of a rare isoform results in increased cell proliferation and transformation when compared to other NRAS isoforms (Eisfeld et al., 2014). We identified consistent splicing alterations in several genes commonly affected by loss of function mutations in MDS and cancer, including BCOR and KDM6A; however, splicing changes in both genes resulted in frame-preserving isoforms. Although the functional consequences of these changes are unknown, the dysregulated isoform of BCOR has been shown to lack a domain necessary to interact with the transcription factor AF9 (a common fusion partner of MLL) and repress AF9 transcriptional activity (Srinivasan et al., 2003).  We report here that perturbations in spliceosome and RNA processing genes occur in three independent mutant U2AF1 RNA-seq datasets. It raises the possibility that mutation of a spliceosome gene may result in autoregulatory changes in splicing machinery by altering isoform expression (Jangi and Sharp, 2014). This may account for the mutual exclusivity of spliceosome gene mutations in MDS patients (Haferlach et al., 2014; Papaemmanuil et al., 2013; Walter et al., 2013; Yoshida et al., 2011). Perturbations in the splicing process may have consequences for genome stability, as missplicing has been implicated in co-transcriptional R-loop formation (RNA:DNA hybrid) (Chan et al., 2014; Skourti-Stathaki and Proudfoot, 2014). This may contribute to the increased phospho-H2AX staining we observe in monocytes by inducing DNA damage through R-loop formation. Further studies are needed to address this. Also, the identification of genes involved in ribosome function and translational processes are an interesting consequence of mutant U2AF1 expression, because perturbations in the ribosome have been linked to MDS (Barlow et al., 2010; Ebert et al., 2008; Pellagatti et al., 2008). If other spliceosome gene mutations (e.g. SRSF2, SF3B1) perturb either of these two pathways, it would suggest a unifying mechanism of action for all these mutations. Ultimately, examination of dysregulated splicing caused by other spliceosome gene mutations and comparison with these findings may help clarify which gene pathways are important.  By performing all of our experiments in a cell-autonomous manner using a transplantation model, transgenic donor bone marrow cells necessarily undergo the stress of repopulating the hematopoietic system in the irradiated microenvironment of recipient mice. However, phenotypes observed in the transplanted mice were also seen in non-transplanted transgenic mice, including bone marrow progenitor expansion and monocyte apoptosis (data not shown). While the transgenic model we describe here could be used to test the dependency of tumors on mutant U2AF1 expression (by removing doxycycline once tumors develop), the overexpression of U2AF1(S34F) or U2AF1(WT) transgene, albeit low, is expected to result in non-stoichiometric levels of U2AF1 relative to other splicing factors. However, no detectable phenotypes were observed in U2AF1(WT)-expressing transgenic mice compared to rtTA only controls. Additional models of U2AF1 mutations (e.g., knock-in of S34F at the endogenous U2af1 locus and mice with other U2AF1 mutations) will be important to further characterize the effect of U2AF1 mutations in vivo.  While this study improves our understanding of mutant U2AF1 biology, our ultimate goal is to improve treatment of patients with U2AF1 mutations. The pervasive nature of spliceosome gene mutations in MDS highlights the need to understand and develop effective therapeutic approaches, perhaps by using splicing modulator drugs. This U2AF1 mouse model may be a useful pre-clinical tool to test potential therapies in a variety of cancers with U2AF1 mutations.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Generation of doxycycline-inducible U2AF1(S34F) and U2AF1(WT) transgenic mice  cDNAs that code for human U2AF1(S34F) and U2AF1(WT) were cloned from an MDS patient BM sample (UPN 571656) by RT-PCR using Superscript III kit (Invitrogen) and introduced individually into the pBS31′ vector (Beard et al., 2006) using EcoRI restriction sites. U2AF1(S34F) and (WT) cDNA sequences differed only in the one nucleotide that produced the S34F amino acid conversion. U2AF1(S34F)-pBS31′ and U2AF1(WT)-pBS31′ plasmids were introduced into KH2 ES cells by the FLP/FRT system (Beard et al., 2006) to produce U2AF1(S34F) and U2AF1(WT)-expressing ES cell lines. ES cell clones were selected by hygromycin, and integration of U2AF1 (S34F) or (WT)-pBS31′ was confirmed using PCR and Southern blot approaches. Integration at the 5′ end was detected using standard Southern blotting techniques as described (Beard et al., 2006). PCR screening of ES cells and genotyping of mice were performed with the primers described (Supplemental Materials). KH2 ES cells are (C57BL/6 × 129S4Sv/Jae)F1-derived V6.5 embryonic stem (ES) cells (Beard et al., 2006); therefore, transgenic mouse colonies were maintained by breeding heterozygous, doubly transgenic mice (U2AF1(S34F)/rtTA and U2AF1(WT)/rtTA) to (C57BL/6 × 129S4Sv/Jae)F1 mice. Doxycycline was administered via doxycycline-containing rodent chow (Pico 5053 base, TestDiet) or via doxycycline in water (in UV light-protected red water bottles, changed every 2 days).  All mouse procedures were performed according to protocols approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee.  RT-PCR and pyrosequencing  Following doxycycline induction of transgene expression in vivo, bone marrow cells were harvested from the leg bones. RNA was isolated from bone marrow cell pellets using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) followed by DNA removal with Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion). Reverse transcription PCR was then performed using the Superscript III RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). PCR for U2AF1 and U2af1 to detect exogenous human transgene and endogenous mouse transcripts expressed in transgenic cells, respectively, was performed, and pyrosequencing for single nucleotide polymorphisms that differ between mouse and human cDNAs was performed on PCR products (primer sequences are in the Supplemental Materials).  Murine bone marrow transplant and competitive repopulation assays  To generate mice for each experiment, 1 × 106 transgenic mouse donor bone marrow cells from 2–3 mice pooled (CD45.2) were transplanted into at least 5 lethally-irradiated (1100 rads) congenic wild-type recipient mice (C57BL/6 × 129S4Sv/Jae)F1 (CD45.1/CD45.2) per genotype. Donor mice were between 8–12 weeks of age, and recipient mice ranged from 6–12 weeks of age; donor and recipient mice were sex-matched. Competitive repopulation assays were performed by mixing transgenic donor “test” mouse bone marrow cells (CD45.2) from 2–3 mice in equal proportions with (C57BL/6 × 129S4Sv/Jae)F1 (CD45.1/CD45.2) donor “competitor” mouse bone marrow cells from 2–3 mice, and then transplanted into (C57BL/6 × 129S4Sv/Jae)F1 (CD45.1/CD45.2) recipient mice. Transgene induction was started ≥6 weeks after transplantation.  Mouse hematopoietic progenitor assay  Methylcellulose progenitor colony forming assays (CFU-C) were performed using Methocult GF M3434 (Stem Cell Technologies). Bone marrow and spleen cells were obtained from transplanted mice following doxycycline induction of transgene expression. Red blood cells were lysed prior to plating of 10,000 bone marrow cells or 100,000 spleen cells per 1.3 ml media; each sample was evaluated in duplicate. Progenitor colonies (defined as ≥40 cells/colony) were counted following 7 days culture at 37°C with 5% CO2.  Flow cytometry  Flow cytometry of donor-derived mature cell lineage distribution was performed on bone marrow, peripheral blood, and spleen using the cell surface receptors: CD45.1, CD45.2, CD115, Gr-1, B220, and CD3e (antibodies and procedures described in the Supplemental Materials). Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry for Annexin V (APC, BD Biosciences) and intracellular Phospho-H2AX (FITC, JBW301, EMD Millipore) using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Donor-derived hematopoietic progenitor and stem cell flow cytometry was performed on bone marrow and spleen using the following cell surface markers (antibodies described in the Supplemental Materials): CD45.1, CD45.2, mature lineage (Gr-1, Cd3e, B220, Ter119, and CD41), c-Kit, Sca-1, CD34, Fcγ, CD150, CD48, and Flk2. All flow cytometry was performed using FACScan or Gallios cytometers (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC., Ashland, OR). Progenitor cells were isolated for RNA-seq using an iCyt Synergy flow sorter (Sony).  RNA sequencing of Common Myeloid Progenitors  Donor-derived common myeloid progenitors (CMPs; lin−, c-Kit+, Sca-1−, CD34+, Fcγ−) cells were sorted from pooled bone marrow of 5–7 U2AF1(S34F)- or U2AF1(WT)-transplanted mice. Cells were sorted into DMEM media, and RNA was prepared from cell pellets using a miRNeasy kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was removed by Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion). Ribosomal RNA was depleted (Ribozero, Epicenter), followed by cDNA preparation and TruSeq stranded Illumina library production. 2 × 100bp paired-end sequencing was performed on the HiSeq2000 platform (Illumina).  RNA-seq analysis  Reads were aligned to the mouse mm9 reference genome using TopHat (version 2.0.8) (Kim et al., 2013). All subsequent analyses were performed in R (Gentleman et al., 2004). Differential gene expression was determined using DESeq2 (version 1.6.1) (Anders and Huber, 2010), which applies a negative binomial model to counts of reads mapped to genes. Gene models were provided by Ensembl version 67 (Flicek et al., 2013). Differential junction expression was determined using DEXSeq (version 1.12.1) (Anders et al., 2012), which applies a negative binomial model to (novel or Ensembl-annotated) junction-spanning read counts while controlling for potential changes in overall gene expression between conditions. Gene enrichment analysis was performed using GOseq (version 1.18.0) (Young et al., 2010), which accounts for gene-length induced biases. Regions spanning junctions were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (Kent et al., 2002) using BSgenome (version 1.34.0), and their sequence logos were created using seqLogo (1.32.1). Principal component analysis was performed using prcomp, with normalization performed by ggbiplot (version 0.55). Additional bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq data, including splicing ratio calculation, is described in the Supplemental Materials.  RT-PCR and gel electrophoresis for validation of discovered altered junctions  RNA extraction from MDS patient samples, cDNA preparation, and RT-PCR followed by gel electrophoresis were carried out as previously described (Okeyo-Owuor et al., 2014). Briefly, total RNA was treated with DNase using the Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion), and cDNA was generated using the Superscript III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). PCR products were electrophoresed in TBE-polyacrylamide gels and stained with ethidium bromide for imaging. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ. PCR primers are described in the Supplemental Materials.  All patients provided written consent on a protocol approved by the Washington University Human Studies Committee.  Statistical Analyses  Statistical analysis and generation of graphical presentations of data were performed using analysis functions in GraphPad Prism 6 and as described in the Supplemental Materials for RNA-seq analysis.  Accession Number  The RNA-seq data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et al., 2002) and are accessible through the GEO Series accession number GSE66793.  ​ SIGNIFICANCE  Mutations in spliceosome genes occur in up to ~50% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), suggesting that perturbations in pre-mRNA splicing contribute to disease pathogenesis. We generated a murine model of the most common mutation in the spliceosome gene U2AF1 and observed hematopoietic phenotypes and pre-mRNA splicing alterations that also occur in MDS and acute myeloid leukemia patients. Concordant changes in isoform expression of RNA processing genes, ribosomal genes, and recurrently mutated genes in myeloid cancers in the mouse and human highlight cellular processes and pathways that may functionally contribute to mutant U2AF1-associated diseases. Determining whether splicing changes in the same genes are induced by other MDS-associated spliceosome gene mutations may further prioritize key target genes in MDS.  Abstract Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematopoietic stem cell disorders that often progress to chemotherapy-resistant secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). We used whole genome sequencing to perform an unbiased comprehensive screen to discover all the somatic mutations in a sAML sample and genotyped these loci in the matched MDS sample. Here we show that a missense mutation affecting the serine at codon 34 (S34) in U2AF1 was recurrently mutated in 13/150 (8.7%) de novo MDS patients, with suggestive evidence of an associated increased risk of progression to sAML. U2AF1 is a U2 auxiliary factor protein that recognizes the AG splice acceptor dinucleotide at the 3′ end of introns and mutations are located in highly conserved zinc fingers in U2AF11,2. Mutant U2AF1 promotes enhanced splicing and exon skipping in reporter assays in vitro. This novel, recurrent mutation in U2AF1 implicates altered pre-mRNA splicing as a potential mechanism for MDS pathogenesis.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogenous group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by dysplastic blood cell formation and peripheral blood cytopenias. Up to 30% of patients with MDS will progress to highly chemotherapy-resistant secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers an unbiased approach to discover all the genetic mutations present in cancer genomes and has been used to identify novel mutations in de novo and therapy-related AML genomes3–7. Here we report the results of WGS of an MDS-derived sAML sample and the matched normal (skin) sample. We performed WGS using 100 base pair paired-end reads and obtained 39.1x and 38.2x haploid and 99.3% and 98.9% diploid coverage of the sAML and normal samples, respectively (see Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 1). We divided the genome into non-overlapping tiers, as previously described4, and validated putative mutations using deep sequencing of captured DNA isolated from the sAML, normal, and MDS samples. We validated 507 somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the sAML sample, including 30 SNVs in protein coding regions (tier 1 mutations). 505/507 SNVs preexisted in the MDS sample, including 30 tier 1 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Tables 2, 3). The same codon in U2AF1 (U2AF35) was mutated in 2 additional MDS-derived sAML cases analyzed by whole genome sequencing (data not shown). This was the sole recurrent mutation in these cases. To determine the frequency of this mutation in MDS, we sequenced the entire coding region of U2AF1, including 9 exons, in diagnostic bone marrow and paired normal (skin) samples from 150 consecutively accrued de novo MDS patients (including the index case) and identified 13 patients (8.7%) with missense mutations affecting the highly conserved serine at amino acid position 34 (S34) in U2AF1 (Fig. 1a). The same nucleotide was mutated in all samples, resulting in either a S34F (n=11) or S34Y (n=2) substitution (Supplementary Table 4). One patient with an S34F mutation (UPN 947519) also had a U2AF1 Q157R mutation located in the second zinc finger (Fig. 1a). Sequencing of the U2AF1 cDNA from this patient revealed that both mutations occur on the same allele. No other somatic SNVs affecting U2AF1 were detected in these samples. Subsequent analysis focused on the highly recurrent S34 mutations.  Figure 1 Figure 1 U2AF1 mutations found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) U2AF1 is the small (35 kDa) subunit of U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) that is involved in pre-mRNA processing (splicing), and it forms a heterodimer with the larger subunit U2AF2 (U2AF65)2. U2AF1 binds the 3′ AG splice acceptor dinucleotide of the pre-mRNA target intron2 and U2AF2 binds the adjacent polypyrimidine tract. PCR amplicons spanning the S34 codon were generated using genomic DNA and cDNA templates from unpurified MDS bone marrow cells from 11 patients with confirmed U2AF1 mutations, and subjected to deep sequencing to obtain mutant allele frequencies. Importantly, there was no deletion or uniparental isodisomy (UPD) that spanned the U2AF1 locus (chromosome 21q22.3) based on SNP arrays and whole genome sequencing data for the index case. Read counts from the genomic DNA samples (including the sAML sample from the index case and serial MDS samples from two other patients) showed that the S34 mutant allele frequencies were ~40–50%, indicating that the majority of cells in the samples contained a heterozygous mutation, even though the myeloblast counts ranged from 0–21% in the MDS samples (Fig. 1b). Similar results were obtained from cDNA deep sequencing (~30–50% mutant allele frequency), indicating that both the S34 mutant and wild-type alleles were expressed in all samples tested, regardless of the myeloblast count (Fig. 1c). In addition, there was no difference in the total levels of U2AF1 mRNA or the dominant U2AF1 isoform that was expressed in unfractionated MDS bone marrow samples from patients with and without U2AF1 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Collectively, these results suggest that U2AF1 mutations are an early, initiating genetic event in MDS pathogenesis.  Although eight of the mutant samples had myeloblast counts > 5%, patients with U2AF1 mutations were not restricted to a particular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) category and had a median IPSS score of 1 (range 0–3) (Supplementary Table 5). Patients with a del(20q) or −20 karyotype were more likely to harbor a U2AF1 mutation (P=0.03), although the number of patients with mutations and del(20q) or −20 is small (n=4) (Table 1). No difference in event-free or overall survival was observed in patients with or without U2AF1 mutations (Fig. 2a–b). However, the 2 mutant patients with the longest overall survival had received hematopoietic stem cell transplants (Supplementary Fig. 1). Patients with U2AF1 mutations had an increased probability of progression to sAML (P=0.03) (Fig. 2c), an observation that will require confirmation in a larger cohort. This corresponds to a U2AF1 mutation frequency of 15.2% (7/46 patients) in the subset of MDS patients that progress to sAML vs. 5.8% (6/104 patients) in the subset that did not. Since there was no statistical difference in the myeloblast count or IPSS distribution of patients with or without U2AF1 mutations (Table 1), the mutant genotype does not appear to be a surrogate for these well-established predictors of sAML risk.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Impact of U2AF1 mutations on clinical outcome Table 1 Table 1 Patient Characteristics Splicing involves cleavage of intronic sequences from pre-mRNA, followed by ligation of the remaining exons together to produce a mature mRNA product8. Inclusion and exclusion of different exons or utilization of alternative 3′ splice sites during pre-mRNA processing produces multiple protein isoforms that can have different functions within a cell, and alternative splicing can be affected by the levels of U2AF1 in a cell9–12. It is unknown which domain of U2AF1 binds the pre-mRNA. Interestingly, the S34 and Q157 residues are located within zinc finger domains (Fig. 1a) that may be important for RNA binding activity. Indeed, the U2AF1 zinc fingers are structurally similar to the murine and human ZFP36 family zinc fingers (both CX8CX5CX3H zinc fingers)13–15 that bind RNA and the noncanonical RNA recognition motif (RRM; also known as U2AF homology motif, UHM) in U2AF1 only weakly binds RNA16.  To examine the effects of the S34F mutation on U2AF1 splicing activity, we utilized previously described and validated in vitro double-reporter splicing and minigene reporter assays9,17. The double-reporter plasmid constitutively expresses β-galactosidase, while luciferase is expressed only if appropriate splicing removes an upstream intron that contains translational stop codons. Transient co-expression of the double-reporter plasmid pTN24 and the S34F mutant U2AF1 cDNA in 293T cells resulted in a significant increase in splicing (as detected by an increase in the luciferase/β-galactosidase ratio), compared to co-expression of wild-type U2AF1, despite similar total U2AF1 protein levels in all samples (Fig. 3a, P<0.001). The level of splicing was similar in cells depleted of endogenous U2AF1 compared to control cells (Fig. 3b, left column), and the increase in splicing observed with the S34F mutant U2AF1 is independent of endogenous U2AF1 levels (Fig. 3b, right column, P<0.001 when compared to vector alone). This suggests that splicing activity in this assay is insensitive to U2AF1 levels, and increased splicing mediated by the mutant protein is attributable to a novel gain-of-function activity.  Figure 3 Figure 3 U2AF1 S34F mutation induces splicing alterations Next, we examined exon skipping using a minigene reporter plasmid (a human gene fragment containing an upstream and downstream exon surrounding an intron-flanked exon). Appropriate splicing produces an mRNA with all 3 exons, while exon skipping fuses the upstream and downstream exons only. We measured the levels of exon skipping using a GH1 minigene reporter plasmid in cells transiently co-transfected with either wild-type or S34F mutant U2AF1 cDNA. The proportion of transcripts with a skipped exon (lower PCR band) relative to the appropriately spliced GH1 minigene (upper PCR band) is increased in cells expressing the S34F U2AF1 mutant compared to control or wild-type U2AF1 expression (Fig. 3c, P=0.01). This increase in exon skipping mediated by mutant U2AF1 remained significant after depletion of endogenous U2AF1 in 293T cells (Fig. 3c, P<0.02). We also observed an increased utilization of alternative 3′ cryptic splice sites in the FMR1 gene in clinical MDS samples with U2AF1 mutations compared to MDS samples without U2AF1 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The alternative splicing of FMR1 was confirmed to be mutant U2AF1-dependent using a FMR1 minigene splicing reporter assay in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 3b).  Collectively, these results suggest that U2AF1 S34 mutations may result in subtle increases in splicing efficiency (Fig. 3a) -- or possibly altered isoform expression (Fig. 3c) --which could induce gene expression changes. To test whether U2AF1 mutations alter global gene expression levels, we analyzed mRNA microarray data (Affymetrix U133plus2) obtained from bone marrow CD34+ cells purified from 6 MDS patients with a U2AF1 mutation, 9 MDS patients without a mutation, and 4 normal donors18. The U2AF1 mutant samples did not segregate together using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm with all 19 samples, however, the 6 U2AF1 mutant samples did segregate together when compared to the normal control samples (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Next, we identified the genes that were significantly different between control and mutant patients using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM)19. SAM identified 401 dysregulated probesets (50 up-regulated and 351 down-regulated) in U2AF1 mutant versus control samples (FDR<0.005) (Supplementary Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table 6). Three of the most enriched functional annotation categories for genes that are down-regulated in U2AF1 mutant samples are splicing and RNA recognition motif (RRM) genes (enrichment scores 2.5–4.3) (Supplementary Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 6). These results suggest that a compensatory down-regulation of splicing genes may exist in U2AF1 mutant samples. These gene categories were not down-regulated in U2AF1 wild-type MDS patients compared to controls (data not shown), suggesting that down-regulation of splicing and RRM genes is not common to all MDS samples, but instead is associated with U2AF1 mutations.  Mutations in U2AF1 represent a novel mechanism that could alter gene expression in MDS and expand the list of commonly mutated genes in MDS that may affect transcription or translation, including RPS14, TET2, EZH2, ASXL1, and DNMT3A20–26. Only two patients in our cohort of 150 de novo MDS samples had both a DNMT3A and U2AF1 mutation (Supplementary Table 7). Both of these mutations appear to be early genetic events in MDS, given their high mutant allele burdens in patients with early stage disease26.  U2AF1 is highly conserved (Fig. 1a)1, and homozygous loss is lethal in many organisms27–29. We did not observe any nonsense, frameshift or missense mutations affecting the coordinating CCCH residues in the zinc fingers, again suggesting the S34 mutations are not loss-of-function mutations. The corresponding amino acid in the human ZFP36L2 (a ZFP36 family member) protein interacts with RNA through a hydrogen bond, further suggesting that the S34 position may be important for RNA binding13. Additionally, interactions between conserved aromatic amino acids in ZFP36 family members and RNA bases stabilize the protein RNA complexes formed13. The two amino acid substitutions we identified at S34 add a bulky aromatic ring (phenylalanine or tyrosine) to the zinc finger, which may alter, or even enhance, binding of the zinc finger to RNA. We suggest that the S34F/Y mutations in U2AF1 alter the specificity of U2AF1-dependent splicing. Pre-mRNAs with strong polypyrimidine tracts can splice independently of U2AF1 in vitro, whereas weak polypyrimidine tracts are more dependent on U2AF1 for appropriate splicing2,11. Therefore, the pattern of U2AF specificity (determined by both U2AF1 and U2AF2) may be influenced by the nucleotide sequence in pre-mRNAs and may be an important factor in determining which genes are altered in cells expressing mutant U2AF1.  Alternative splicing has been described for a wide range of cancers30,31, although the underlying mechanisms that influence cancer pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Alterations in the transcriptome mediated by alternative splicing may contribute directly to cancer, or indirectly by engaging some other pathway. The identification of somatic mutations in spliceosome genes in MDS by our group and others32–34, raises the possibility that mutations in splicing factors, including U2AF1, may be responsible for the observed alterations of splicing in cancer. Ultimately, cancer cells may generate genetic diversity in a large number of genes by selecting cells with mutations in U2AF1 or other spliceosome proteins. Identification of key target genes affected by U2AF1 mutations will be critical for our understanding of how these mutations contribute to MDS pathogenesis.  Go to: ONLINE METHODS Flow sorting of bone marrow samples  Bone marrow cells from the secondary AML (sAML) sample, cryopreserved in 10% DMSO, were rapidly thawed at 37°C, washed, and stained with PE-Cy7 conjugated hCD45, clone J.33 (Beckman Coulter), and FITC conjugated anti-hCD34, clone 581 (Beckman Coulter). The blast population (low SSC/CD45 dim) was sorted using a Reflection high speed cell sorter (Sony iCyt) directly into lysis buffer and genomic DNA was prepared by column purification (Qiagen DNeasy).  Whole genome sequence production  Four DNA libraries were generated for paired-end sequencing: two from the tumor sample (flow-sorted sAML myeloblasts), and two from the normal sample (punch biopsy of unaffected skin). Sequence data was generated using both Illumina GAIIx and Illumina Hiseq platforms in 2 × 100 paired-end reads. Reads were aligned individually to NCBI Build 36 of the human reference sequence using BWA 0.5.5 and SAMtools r544. Alignments were merged into a single BAM file and marked for duplicates using Picard 1.17 (http://picard.sourceforge.net). Only non-duplicate reads were used for all downstream analyses.  Somatic mutation detection  Candidate point mutations were predicted using SomaticSniper (D. Larson et al, in press), previously referred to as glfSomatic4,35. Putative single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with somatic score of 40 and average mapping quality of 40 were considered high-confidence (HC); all others were deemed low-confidence (LC). Small (<100 bp) insertion/deletion events (indels) were called using a combination of GATK36, IndelGenotyper, Pindel37, and a modified version of SAMtools38. Both SNVs and indels were annotated using gene structure and conservation information, and classified by tier as previously described4. Briefly, tier 1 contains all changes in the amino acid coding regions of annotated exons, consensus splice-site regions, and RNA genes (including microRNA genes). Tier 2 contains changes in highly conserved regions of the genome or regions that have regulatory potential. Tier 3 contains mutations in the nonrepetitive part of the genome that do not meet tier 2 criteria, and tier 4 contains mutations in the remainder of the genome. High confidence tier 2 and tier 3 mutations, and all tier 1 mutations (regardless of confidence) were selected for validation (see below).  To identify somatic DNA copy number changes from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, reads aligned by BWA39 were binned into contiguous, non-overlapping 1 kb windows. Copy number for each bin was normalized to the median copy number for each chromosome in tumor and normal separately. A Hidden Markov Model algorithm40 was used to generate a list of segments with copy number expressed as log2 (tumor/normal). Copy number changes were also supported if loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was observed in the affected regions. In brief, heterozygous SNPs were identified in WGS data from the normal sample (>10 reads of >q10 quality with non-reference allele frequencies of 0.4–0.6). The variant allele frequencies at these positions were then averaged in bins of 20 consecutive SNPs and visualized for the normal and tumor samples separately. Deletions, amplifications, inter-, and intrachromsomal rearrangements were also predicted using the BreakDancer algorithm41.  Mutation validation  To comprehensively evaluate tier 1–3 predictions, we utilized a custom solid-phase capture platform. We selected all tier 1 SNV predictions (HC and LC) and all HC tier 2–3 SNVs. Tier 1–3 indel predictions were also included. In addition, we used this approach to validate SV predictions (deletions and rearrangements). We identified 8–16 SNPs that were heterozygous in the normal DNA sample (determined using the WGS and SNPa data) that were located within the affected segments and 8 SNPs from flanking normal regions. The genomic positions of SNVs and indels (with a 200 bp margin) and SVs (with a 400 bp margin) were submitted for probe design. Probes were synthesized on custom HD2.1 long oligonucleotide arrays (Roche NimbleGen). Whole genome amplified DNA (REPLI-g, Qiagen) from the normal (skin), unfractionated MDS, and unfractionated sAML samples was used as bait for capture on the arrays and the recovered DNA (enriched for target sequences) was resequenced on the Illumina GAIIx platform.  At least 10x coverage was obtained for ~87.16% of the target sequence for all samples (see Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 1). Reads were mapped using BWA39, deduplicated, and merged into BAM files. The reference or somatic status at the nucleotide of interest was then determined for each sample using VarScan242 with the following parameters: min-coverage=10, min-var-freq=0.05, somatic-p-value<0.01, validation=1. To validate low-frequency (2–5%) SNVs, we re-ran VarScan with adjusted parameters: min-coverage=100, min-var-freq=0.02, somatic-p-value<0.01, validation=1. In validation mode, VarScan reads data from tumor and normal samples simultaneously, performing pair-wise comparisons at every position covered in both samples. Each position is classified as Reference (wild-type), Germline, LOH, or Somatic, based upon a comparison of the consensus genotypes and supporting read counts (Fisher’s Exact test). Positions called Somatic are further subjected to our internally-developed false-positive filter which removes sequencing- and alignment-related artifacts using several criteria (read count, mapping quality, average read position, strand representation, homopolymer-like sequence context, mismatch quality sum difference, trimmed read length, Q2 distance) and were manually reviewed. Chromosome X and Y somatic positions are determined using the false-positive filter and manual review. SIFT and PolyPhen2 computational algorithms were used to predict whether U2AF1 mutations were damaging, as previously described43,44.  Sanger sequencing  To screen for recurrence of U2AF1 mutations, we performed Sanger sequencing using whole genome amplified DNA extracted from unfractionated bone marrow aspirates and paired normal tissue (skin) from 150 individual patients with de novo MDS. PCR amplicons covering all 9 exons and splice sites in U2AF1 were sequenced using BigDye chemistry and analyzed on an ABI 3730 sequencer (primer sequences in Supplementary Table 8). Sequence variants were called by The Genome Institute’s mutational profiling pipeline and manually reviewed. Potential somatic mutations (present in the bone marrow sample and not detectable in skin) were confirmed by independent PCR and sequencing.  Deep sequencing of U2AF1 mutations in DNA and cDNA  Unfractionated bone marrow samples from 11 patients with validated U2AF1 mutations were selected for deep sequencing to estimate clone size. Whole genome amplified DNA from normal (skin), MDS, and sAML samples were amplified by PCR individually using barcoded primers (Supplementary Table 8). The products were then pooled and sequenced on the Roche/454 platform. In parallel, RNA was extracted from MDS and sAML samples (Trizol, Invitrogen), converted to cDNA using the Ovation RNA-seq Kit (NuGEN), and amplified with barcoded primers spanning intron/exon boundaries (Supplementary Table 8). Reads were aligned to Hs36 using BWA-SW39. Following alignment, BAM and pileup files were generated using SAMtools and analyzed by Picard to remove duplicates. Only uniquely mapped bases with >q20 scores were retained. Reads supporting the reference or variant allele were identified by VarScan2.  SNP array analysis  Genomic DNA samples (not subjected to whole genome amplification) from the normal, MDS, and sAML specimens (not flow-sorted) were hybridized to Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays (Affymetrix, Inc.). Analysis of copy number alterations and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite (Partek, Inc).  mRNA expression profiling  Total RNA was harvested from unfractionated bone marrow cells (69% myeloblast) from the secondary AML sample from UPN 266395 and hybridized to the Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST array. Raw data was extracted using the Affymetrix Expression Console (Affymetrix, Inc.) and analyzed in Prism 5.04 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).  Total RNA was harvested from CD34+ purified MDS bone marrow samples (n=15) and control bone marrow (n=4) and hybridized to the Affymetrix U133plus2 array, as previously reported18. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed using Ward’s clustering algorithm with a Euclidean distance similarity measure in Spotfire (TIBCO Software Inc). Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7b were performed as previously described19,45,46.  Reverse transcriptase PCR  cDNA was made from RNA using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase or Superscript III kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) (primer and probe sequences for GAPDH are provided in47). The U2AF1 primer and probe set spans exons 2–3 (Hs00739599_m1, Applied Biosystems). All samples were run in duplicate on a 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using the relative standard curve method. Non-quantitative RT-PCR for U2AF1 mRNA isoform expression was performed and loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Forward: 5′-GCCTCCATCTTCGGCACCGA-3′, Reverse: 5′-GGCATGGCTCAGAATCGCCC-3′).  Generation of U2AF1 expression plasmids  RNA from a patient bone marrow biopsy (UPN 571656) was used to generate both U2AF1 (wild-type) and U2AF1 (S34F mutant) expression vectors. cDNA was generated from patient bone marrow RNA using Superscript III kit (Invitrogen). Both wild-type and mutant U2AF1 cDNAs were obtained via PCR amplification, cloned with the Topo Cloning kit (Invitrogen), and sequenced for verification. The U2AF1 cDNAs were then shuttled into the EcoRI site of the pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen) for transient transfection experiments.  Luciferase-β-galactosidase double-reporter assay  293T cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (1 × 106 per well) and cultured in DMEM (Gibco/Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and L-glutamine. Following overnight culture, cells were co-transfected with the expression vectors (U2AF1 wild-type or S34F mutant, or empty vector) and the pTN24 splicing reporter plasmid (containing a constitutively expressed β-galactosidase reporter for transfection normalization and a luciferase reporter that is conditional on removal of a translational stop codon by splicing) with or without splicing modulators hnRNPG and Tra2α17. In some experiments, cells were also co-transfected with 30nM U2AF1-specific siRNA (5′-CGUAGAAAGUGUUGUAGUUGAUUGA-3′; IDT, Inc.) or 30nM siRNA scramble control (Dharmacon). Cells were harvested 48 hours following transfection, and reporter expression was detected, as previously described17 using the Dual Light Reporter System (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed by calculating the ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase signal. Changes in U2AF1 levels were confirmed by Western blot using antibodies specific for U2AF1 (SAS1300700, Sigma-Aldrich) or β-actin (A5441, Sigma-Aldrich) as a loading control. Three independent experiments were performed and the data was analyzed using a Student’s t-test.  Minigene constructs and transfection  293T cells were cultured and transfected with U2AF1 expression vectors, as above. Cells were also co-transfected with a GH1 minigene splicing reporter construct9. In other experiments, cells were co-transfected with a FMR1 minigene splicing reporter construct containing partial sequence from exons 14 and 15 and the complete intronic sequence. Amplification of the FMR1 DNA fragment (including the intron) was achieved using the FMR1-201 E15 set of primer sequences previously published10. The amplified fragment was cloned into the TopoTA vector (Invitrogen), purified following BamH1 and XhoI digestion, and subsequently cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Co-transfection of U2AF1 or control siRNAs was also performed, as above. Cells were harvested 48 hours following transfection, and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis via RT-PCR with random hexamers and oligo(dT) primers. Changes in minigene splicing were then measured by PCR of the cDNA using a T7 forward primer and gene-specific reverse primers as previously described9,10 and quantified by densitometry. U2AF1 knockdown by siRNA and U2AF1 reconstitution were confirmed by Western blot analysis, as above. Three to four independent experiments were performed and the data was analyzed using a Student’s t-test. Whole-exome sequencing studies have identified common mutations affecting genes encoding components of the RNA splicing machinery in hematological malignancies. Here, we sought to determine how mutations affecting the 3′ splice site recognition factor U2AF1 alter its normal role in RNA splicing. We find that U2AF1 mutations influence the similarity of splicing programs in leukemias, but do not give rise to widespread splicing failure. U2AF1 mutations cause differential splicing of hundreds of genes, affecting biological pathways such as DNA methylation (DNMT3B), X chromosome inactivation (H2AFY), the DNA damage response (ATR, FANCA), and apoptosis (CASP8). We show that U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3′ splice site motif in patients, in cell culture, and in vitro. Mutations affecting the first and second zinc fingers give rise to different alterations in splice site preference and largely distinct downstream splicing programs. These allele-specific effects are consistent with a computationally predicted model of U2AF1 in complex with RNA. Our findings suggest that U2AF1 mutations contribute to pathogenesis by causing quantitative changes in splicing that affect diverse cellular pathways, and give insight into the normal function of U2AF1’s zinc finger domains.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of blood disorders characterized by dysplastic and ineffective hematopoiesis. Patients frequently suffer from cytopenias and are at increased risk for disease transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Tefferi and Vardiman 2009). The only curative treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, for which most patients are ineligible due to advanced age at diagnosis. The development of new therapies has been slowed by our incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease.  Recent sequencing studies of MDS patient exomes identified common mutations affecting genes encoding components of the RNA splicing machinery, with ∼45%–85% of patients affected (Graubert et al. 2011; Papaemmanuil et al. 2011; Yoshida et al. 2011; Visconte et al. 2012). Spliceosomal genes are the most common targets of somatic point mutations in MDS, suggesting that dysregulated splicing may constitute a common theme linking the disparate disorders that comprise MDS. Just four genes—SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2—carry the bulk of the mutations, which are mutually exclusive and occur in heterozygous contexts (Yoshida et al. 2011). Targeted sequencing studies identified high-frequency mutations in these genes in other hematological malignancies as well, including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and AML with myelodysplastic features (Yoshida et al. 2011). Of the four commonly mutated genes, SF3B1, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 encode proteins involved in 3′ splice site recognition (Shen et al. 2010; Cvitkovic and Jurica 2012), suggesting that altered 3′ splice site recognition is an important feature of the pathogenesis of MDS and related myeloid neoplasms.  U2AF1 (also known as U2AF35) may provide a useful model system to dissect the molecular consequences of MDS-associated spliceosomal gene mutations. U2AF1 mutations are highly specific—they uniformly affect the S34 and Q157 residues within the first and second CCCH zinc fingers of the protein—making comprehensive studies of all mutant alleles feasible (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, U2AF1’s biochemical role in binding the AG dinucleotide of the 3′ splice site is relatively well-defined (Merendino et al. 1999; Wu et al. 1999; Zorio and Blumenthal 1999). U2AF1 preferentially recognizes the core RNA sequence motif yAG|r (Fig. 1B), which matches the genomic consensus 3′ splice site and intron|exon boundary that crosslinks with U2AF1 (Wu et al. 1999). Nevertheless, our understanding of U2AF1:RNA interactions is incomplete. U2AF1’s U2AF homology motif (UHM) is known to mediate U2AF1:U2AF2 heterodimer formation (Kielkopf et al. 2001); however, both the specific protein domains that give rise to U2AF1’s RNA binding specificity and the normal function of U2AF1’s zinc fingers are unknown. Accordingly, the precise mechanistic consequences of U2AF1 mutations are difficult to predict.  Figure 1. Figure 1. U2AF1 mutations contribute to splicing programs in AML. (A) U2AF1 domain structure (Kielkopf et al. 2001; The UniProt Consortium 2012) and common mutations. (CCCH) CCCH zinc finger. (B) Schematic of U2AF1 interaction with the 3′ splice site of ... Since the initial reports of common U2AF1 mutations in MDS, the molecular consequences of U2AF1 mutations have been controversial. An early study found that overexpression of mutant U2AF1 in HeLa cells resulted in dysfunctional splicing marked by frequent inclusion of premature termination codons and intron retention (Yoshida et al. 2011), while another early study reported increased exon skipping in a minigene assay following mutant U2AF1 expression in 293T cells, as well as increased cryptic splice site usage in the FMR1 gene in MDS samples (Graubert et al. 2011). U2AF1 mutations have been suggested to cause both alteration/gain of function (Graubert et al. 2011) and loss of function (Yoshida et al. 2011; Makishima et al. 2012). More recently, two studies analyzed acute myeloid leukemia transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and found that exons with increased or decreased inclusion in samples with U2AF1 mutations exhibited different nucleotides prior to the AG of the 3′ splice site (Przychodzen et al. 2013; Brooks et al. 2014), suggesting that U2AF1 mutations may cause specific alterations to the RNA splicing process.  To determine how U2AF1 mutations alter RNA splicing in hematopoietic cells, we combined patient data, cell culture experiments, and biochemical studies. We found that U2AF1 mutations cause splicing alterations in biological pathways previously implicated in myeloid malignancies, including epigenetic regulation and the DNA damage response. U2AF1 mutations drive differential splicing by altering the preferred 3′ splice site motif in an allele-specific manner. Our results identify downstream targets of U2AF1 mutations that may contribute to pathogenesis, show that different U2AF1 mutations are not mechanistically equivalent, and give insight into the normal function of U2AF1’s zinc finger domains.  Go to: Results U2AF1 mutations are associated with distinct splicing programs in AML  We first tested whether U2AF1 mutations were relevant to splicing programs in leukemias with an unbiased approach. We quantified genome-wide cassette exon splicing in the transcriptomes of 169 de novo adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples that were sequenced as part of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2013) and performed unsupervised cluster analysis. Five of the seven samples carrying a U2AF1 mutation clustered together (Fig. 1C). One of the samples that fell outside of this cluster had a Q157 rather than S34 U2AF1 mutation, and the other carried a mutation in the putative RNA splicing gene KHDRBS3 in addition to a U2AF1 mutation, potentially contributing to its placement in an outgroup. Both of the outgroup U2AF1 mutant samples additionally had low mutant allele expression relative to wild-type (WT) allele expression (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that U2AF1 mutations are associated with distinct splicing patterns in patients and are consistent with a recent report that spliceosomal mutations define a subgroup of myeloid malignancies based on gene expression and DNA methylation patterns (Taskesen et al. 2014).  U2AF1 mutations alter RNA splicing in blood cells  To determine how U2AF1 mutations affect RNA splicing in an experimentally tractable system, we generated K562 erythroleukemic cell lines that stably expressed transgenic FLAG-tagged U2AF1 protein (WT, S34F, S34Y, Q157P, or Q157R mutations) at modest levels in the presence of the endogenous protein (Fig. 2A). This expression strategy, in which the transgene was modestly overexpressed at levels of 1.8–4.7× endogenous U2AF1 (Fig. 2B), is consistent with the coexpression of WT and mutant alleles at approximately equal levels that we observed in AML transcriptomes. Similar coexpression of WT and mutant alleles has been previously reported in MDS patients carrying U2AF1 mutations (Graubert et al. 2011). We separately knocked down (KD) endogenous U2AF1 to ∼13% of normal U2AF1 protein levels in the absence of transgenic expression to test whether the mutations cause gain or loss of function (Fig. 2A).  Figure 2. Figure 2. U2AF1 mutations alter splicing, but do not cause splicing failure. (A) Western blots showing levels of FLAG-tagged U2AF1 in K562 cells stably expressing the indicated alleles (top) and levels of endogenous U2AF1 in K562 cells following transfection with ... To identify mutation-dependent changes in splicing, we performed deep RNA-seq on these K562 cell lines stably expressing each mutant protein and on the control and U2AF1 KD cells (∼100M 2 × 49 bp reads per cell line). This provided sufficient read coverage to measure quantitative inclusion of ∼20,000 cassette exons that were alternatively spliced in K562 cells. Unsupervised cluster analysis of global cassette exon inclusion in these cell lines placed S34F/Y and Q157P/R as distinct groups and revealed that mutations within the first and second zinc fingers are associated with largely distinct patterns of exon inclusion (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with our cluster analysis of AML transcriptomes, in which the one sample with a Q157 mutation was placed as an outgroup to samples with S34 mutations.  We next assembled comprehensive maps of splicing changes driven by U2AF1 mutations in AML transcriptomes, K562 cells expressing mutant U2AF1, and K562 cells following U2AF1 KD. We tested ∼125,000 annotated alternative splicing events for differential splicing and assayed ∼160,000 constitutive splice junctions for evidence of novel alternative splicing or intron retention. We required a minimum change in isoform ratio of 10% to call an event differentially spliced. As our cluster analysis of K562 cells indicated that S34 and Q157 mutations generated distinct splicing patterns, we compared the six S34 AML samples to all U2AF1 WT AML samples. We separately identified splicing changes caused by both S34F and S34Y or both Q157P and Q157R in K562 cells relative to the WT control cells. The resulting catalogs of differentially spliced events revealed that all major classes of alternative splicing events, including cassette exons, competing splice sites, and retained introns, were affected by U2AF1 mutations (Fig. 2D; Supplemental Files S1–S5). Cassette exons constituted the majority of affected splicing events, followed by alternative splicing or intron retention of splice junctions annotated as constitutive in the UCSC Genome Browser (Meyer et al. 2013).  Thousands of splicing events were affected by each U2AF1 mutation, but the fraction of differentially spliced events was relatively low. For example, >400 frame-preserving cassette exons were differentially spliced in association with S34Y versus WT U2AF1 mutations; however, those >400 cassette exons constituted only ∼3.6% of frame-preserving cassette exons that are alternatively spliced in K562 cells (Fig. 2E). Expression of any mutant allele caused differential splicing of 2%–5% of frame-preserving cassette exons, with a bias toward exon skipping (Supplemental Fig. S1A). We did not observe increased levels of retained introns or isoforms that are predicted substrates for degradation by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) in association with any U2AF1 mutation. Instead, constitutive intron removal appeared slightly more efficient in cells expressing mutant versus WT U2AF1 (Fig. 2F; Supplemental Fig. S1B,C). In contrast, we did observe increased levels of predicted NMD substrates and mRNAs with unspliced introns following U2AF1 KD (Supplemental Fig. S1B,C). Consistent with these findings in K562 cells, AML samples carrying U2AF1 mutations did not exhibit increased levels of NMD substrates or intron retention (Fig. 2G; Supplemental Figs. S2–S4). We conclude that S34 and Q157 U2AF1 mutations cause splicing changes affecting hundreds of exons, but do not give rise to widespread splicing failure.  These results contrast with a previous report that the U2AF1 S34F mutation causes overproduction of mRNAs slated for degradation and genome-wide intron retention (Yoshida et al. 2011). The discrepancy between those results and our observations are likely due to differing experimental designs. This previous study acutely expressed the S34F mutation at ∼50× WT levels in HeLa cells, whereas we stably expressed each mutant protein at 1.8–4.7× WT levels in blood cells (Fig. 1D). Maintaining a balance between WT and mutant protein expression—like that observed in AML and MDS patients—may be important to maintain efficient splicing.  U2AF1 mutations cause differential splicing of cancer-relevant genes  We next sought to identify downstream targets of U2AF1 mutations that might contribute to myeloid pathogenesis. We took a conservative approach of requiring differential splicing in AML transcriptomes as well as in K562 cells to help identify disease-relevant events that are likely direct consequences of U2AF1 mutations. We intersected differentially spliced events identified in three distinct comparisons: AML S34 versus WT samples, K562 S34 versus WT expression, and K562 Q157 versus WT expression. Of AML S34-associated differential splicing, 16.8% was phenocopied in K562 S34 cells versus 4.6% for K562 Q157 cells, consistent with allele-specific effects of U2AF1 mutations (Fig. 3A). The relatively low overlap of ∼17% between AML and K562 S34-associated differential splicing is likely due to differences in gene expression patterns between K562 and AML cells, the modest nature of splicing changes caused by U2AF1 mutations (such that many changes fall near the border of our statistical thresholds for differential splicing), and our stringent restriction to events that are differentially spliced in association with both S34F and S34Y mutations in K562 cells. This analysis revealed 54 splicing events that were affected by both S34 and Q157 mutations in AML transcriptomes and K562 cells. When we instead intersected genes containing differentially spliced events—not requiring that identical exons or splice sites be affected—we found a substantially increased intersection of 140 genes (Table 1).  Figure 3. Figure 3. U2AF1 mutations affect genes involved in disease-relevant cellular processes. (A) Overlap between mutation-dependent differential splicing in AML S34F/Y patients, K562 S34F/Y cells, and K562 Q157P/R cells. Overlap taken at the level of specific events ... Table 1. Table 1. Genes that are differentially spliced in association with U2AF1 mutations Many genes that were differentially spliced in association with U2AF1 mutations participate in biological pathways previously implicated in myeloid malignancies. For example, DNMT3A encodes a de novo DNA methyltransferase and is a common mutational target in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (Ley et al. 2010; Walter et al. 2011). Multiple exons of its paralog DNMT3B, including an exon encoding part of the methyltransferase domain, are differentially spliced in AML patients carrying U2AF1 mutations as well as in K562 cells expressing U2AF1 mutant protein (Fig. 3B–D; Supplemental Fig. S5A,B). Similarly, different exons of ASXL1 are alternatively spliced in association with S34 mutations in AML transcriptomes and K562 cells, although the same exons are not consistently affected (Supplemental Files S1–S5). ASXL1 is a common mutational target in myelodysplastic syndromes and related disorders (Gelsi-Boyer et al. 2009), and U2AF1 and ASXL1 mutations co-occur more frequently than expected by chance (Thol et al. 2012). Other genes participating in epigenetic processes are differentially spliced as well, such as H2AFY (Fig. 3E; Supplemental Fig. S5C). H2AFY encodes the core histone macro-H2A.1, which is important for X chromosome inactivation (Hernández-Muñoz et al. 2005). As loss of X chromosome inactivation causes an MDS-like disease in mice (Yildirim et al. 2013), differential splicing of macro-H2A.1 could potentially be relevant to disease processes.  Isoform switches, wherein a previously minor isoform becomes the major isoform, were relatively rare but did occur. For example, a cassette exon at the 3′ end of the ATR gene, which encodes a PI3K-related kinase that activates the DNA damage checkpoint, is included at high rates in association with S34, but not Q157, mutations. This cassette exon alters the C terminus of the ATR protein, may render the mRNA susceptible to nonsense-mediated decay, and is highly conserved (Fig. 3F,G; Supplemental Fig. S5D). S34 mutations similarly cause an isoform switch from an intron-proximal to an intron-distal 3′ splice site of CASP8 that is predicted to shorten the N terminus of the protein (Fig. 3H; Supplemental Fig. S5E).  We noticed that splicing changes frequently affected multiple genes relevant to a specific biological process, such as DNA damage (ATR and FANCA) (Fig. 3G,I; Supplemental Fig. S5D,F). Consistent with this observation, Gene Ontology analysis indicated that genes involved in the cell cycle, chromatin modification, DNA methylation, DNA repair, and RNA processing pathways, among others, are enriched for differential splicing in both AML transcriptomes and K562 cells in association with U2AF1 mutations. This enrichment could be due to high basal rates of alternative splicing within these genes, which frequently are composed of many exons, or instead caused by specific targeting by mutant U2AF1. Upon correcting for gene-specific variation in the number of possible alternatively spliced isoforms, these pathways were no longer enriched in Gene Ontology analyses. We conclude that U2AF1 mutations preferentially affect specific biological pathways, but that this enrichment is due to frequent alternative splicing within such genes rather than specific targeting by U2AF1 mutant protein.  U2AF1 mutations cause allele-specific alterations in the 3′ splice site consensus  Previous biochemical studies showed that U2AF1 recognizes the core sequence motif yAG|r of the 3′ splice site (Merendino et al. 1999; Wu et al. 1999; Zorio and Blumenthal 1999). Accordingly, we hypothesized that the splicing changes caused by U2AF1 mutations might be due to preferential activation or repression of 3′ splice sites in a sequence-specific manner. To test this hypothesis, we identified consensus 3′ splice sites of cassette exons that were promoted or repressed in AML transcriptomes carrying U2AF1 mutations relative to WT patients. For each mutant U2AF1 sample, we enumerated all cassette exons that were differentially spliced between the sample and an average U2AF1 WT sample, requiring a minimum change in isoform ratio of 10%. Exons whose inclusion was increased or decreased in U2AF1 mutant samples exhibited different consensus nucleotides at the −3 and +1 positions flanking the AG of the 3′ splice site. As these positions correspond to the yAG|r motif bound by U2AF1, this data supports our hypothesis that U2AF1 mutations alter 3′ splice site recognition activity in a sequence-specific manner (Fig. 4A).  Figure 4. Figure 4. U2AF1 mutations alter 3′ splice site consensus sequences. (A) Consensus 3′ splice sites of cassette exons with increased or decreased inclusion in U2AF1 mutant relative to WT AML transcriptomes. Boxes highlight sequence preferences at ... Mutations affecting different residues of U2AF1 were associated with distinct alterations in the consensus 3′ splice site motif yAG|r of differentially spliced exons. The S34F and S34Y mutations, affecting the first zinc finger, were associated with nearly identical alterations at the −3 position in all six S34 mutant samples, whereas the Q157P mutation, affecting the second zinc finger, was associated with alterations at the +1 position (Supplemental Fig. S6). In contrast, cassette exons that were differentially spliced in randomly chosen U2AF1 WT samples relative to an average AML sample did not exhibit altered consensus sequences at the −3 or +1 positions (Supplemental Fig. S7). These results confirm the findings of two recent studies of this cohort of AML patients—which reported a frequent preference for C instead of T at the −3 position of differentially spliced cassette exons in U2AF1 mutant samples (Przychodzen et al. 2013; Brooks et al. 2014)—and extend their observations of altered splice site preference to show allele-specific effects of U2AF1 mutations, which have not been previously identified.  U2AF1 mutation-dependent sequence preferences (C/A >> T at the −3 position for S34F/Y and G >> A at the +1 position for Q157P) differ from the genomic consensus for cassette exons. C/T and G/A appear at similar frequencies at the −3 and +1 positions of 3′ splice sites of cassette exons (Supplemental Fig. S6,7), and minigene and genomic studies of competing 3′ splice sites indicate that C and T are approximately equally effective at the −3 position (Smith et al. 1993; Bradley et al. 2012). The consensus 3′ splice sites associated with promoted/repressed cassette exons in U2AF1 mutant transcriptomes also differ from U2AF1’s known RNA binding specificity. A previous study reported a core tAG|g motif in the majority of RNA sequences bound by U2AF1 in a SELEX experiment (Wu et al. 1999). Comparing that motif with preferences observed in U2AF1 mutant transcriptomes, we hypothesize that S34 U2AF1 promotes unusual recognition of C instead of T at the −3 position, while Q157 U2AF1 reinforces preferential recognition of G instead of A at the +1 position.  We next tested whether these alterations in 3′ splice site preference are a direct consequence of U2AF1 mutations. Comparing K562 cells expressing mutant versus WT U2AF1, we found that cassette exons that were promoted or repressed by each mutation exhibited sequence preferences at the −3 and +1 positions that were highly similar to those observed in AML patient samples (Fig. 4B). Mutations affecting identical residues (S34F/Y and Q157P/R) caused similar alterations in 3′ splice site preference, whereas mutations affecting different residues did not, confirming the allele-specific consequences of U2AF1 mutations. In contrast, cassette exons that were differentially spliced following KD of endogenous U2AF1 did not exhibit sequence-specific changes at the −3 or +1 positions of the 3′ splice site (Fig. 4C). We therefore conclude that S34 and Q157 mutations cause alteration or gain of function, consistent with the empirical absence of inactivating (nonsense or frameshift) U2AF1 mutations observed in patients.  U2AF1 mutations preferentially affect U2AF1-dependent 3′ splice sites  U2AF1 mutations are associated with altered 3′ splice site consensus sequences, yet only a relatively small fraction of cassette exons are affected by expression of U2AF1 mutant protein. Previous biochemical studies found that only a subset of exons have “AG-dependent” 3′ splice sites that require U2AF1 binding for proper splice site recognition (Reed 1989; Wu et al. 1999). We therefore speculated that exons that are sensitive to U2AF1 mutations might also rely upon U2AF1 recruitment for normal splicing. We empirically defined U2AF1-dependent exons as those with decreased inclusion following U2AF1 KD and computed the overlap between U2AF1-dependent exons and exons that were affected by U2AF1 mutant protein expression. For every mutation, we observed an enrichment for overlap with U2AF1-dependent exons, suggesting that U2AF1 mutations preferentially affect exons with AG-dependent splice sites (Fig. 4D).  U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3′ splice site motif yAG|r  Our genomics data shows that cassette exons promoted/repressed by U2AF1 mutations have 3′ splice sites differing from the consensus. We therefore tested whether altering the core 3′ splice site motif of an exon influenced its recognition in the presence of WT versus mutant U2AF1. We created a minigene encoding a cassette exon of ATR, which responds robustly to S34 mutations in AML transcriptomes and K562 cells (Fig. 3F,G), by cloning the genomic locus containing the ATR cassette exon and flanking constitutive introns and exons into a plasmid. The minigene exhibited mutation-dependent splicing of the cassette exon, as expected, although cassette exon recognition was less efficient than from the endogenous locus. We then mutated the −3 position of the cassette exon’s 3′ splice site to A/C/G/T and measured cassette exon inclusion in WT and S34Y K562 cells. Robust mutation-dependent increases in splicing required the A at the −3 position found in the endogenous locus, consistent with the unusual preference for A observed in our analyses of AML and K562 transcriptomes. We additionally observed a small but reproducible increase for C (Fig. 5A). We next performed similar experiments for Q157-dependent splicing changes. We created a minigene encoding a cassette exon of EPB49 (encoding the erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.9), mutated the +1 position of the 3′ splice site to A/C/G/T, and measured cassette exon inclusion in WT and Q157R K562 cells. Cassette exon recognition was suppressed by Q157R expression when the +1 position was an A, consistent with our genomic prediction, and was not affected by Q157R when the +1 position was mutated to another nucleotide. Therefore, for both ATR and EPB49, robust S34 and Q157-dependent changes in splicing required the endogenous nucleotides at the −3 and +1 positions.  Figure 5. Figure 5. U2AF1 mutations cause sequence-dependent changes in 3′ splice site recognition. (A) Schematic of ATR minigene (top) and inclusion of ATR cassette exon transcribed from minigenes with A/C/G/T at the −3 position of the 3′ splice ... We next tested how U2AF1 mutations influence constitutive, rather than alternative, splicing in an in vitro context. We used the adenovirus major late (AdML) substrate, a standard model of constitutive splicing, and mutated the −3 position of the 3′ splice site to C/T. We measured AdML splicing efficiency following in vitro transcription and incubation with nuclear extract of K562 cells expressing WT or S34Y U2AF1. The AdML substrate exhibited sequence-specific changes in splicing efficiency in association with U2AF1 mutations. Consistent with our genomic analyses, AdML with C/T at the −3 position was more/less efficiently spliced in S34Y versus WT cells (Fig. 5C). Taken together, our data demonstrate that U2AF1 mutations cause sequence-specific alterations in the preferred 3′ splice site motif in patients, in cell culture, and in vitro.  U2AF1 mutations may modify U2AF1:RNA interactions  Because U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3′ splice site motif yAG|r—the same motif that is recognized and bound by U2AF1 (Wu et al. 1999)—we next investigated whether U2AF1 mutations could potentially modify U2AF1’s RNA binding activity. U2AF1’s RNA binding specificity could originate from its U2AF homology motif (UHM) and/or its two CCCH zinc fingers. The UHM domain mediates U2AF heterodimer formation and is sufficient to promote splicing of an AG-dependent pre-mRNA substrate (Guth et al. 2001; Kielkopf et al. 2001). However, this domain binds a consensus 3′ splice site sequence with low affinity (Kielkopf et al. 2001), suggesting that it may be insufficient to generate U2AF1’s sequence specificity. Because U2AF1’s zinc fingers are independently required for U2AF RNA binding (Webb and Wise 2004), and our data indicate that zinc finger mutations alter splice site preferences, we hypothesized that U2AF1’s zinc fingers might directly interact with the 3′ splice site.  To evaluate whether this hypothesis is sterically possible, we started from the experimentally determined structure of the UHM domain in complex with a peptide from U2AF2 (Kielkopf et al. 2001), modeled the conformations of the zinc finger domains bound to RNA by aligning them to the CCCH zinc finger domains in the TIS11d:RNA complex structure (Hudson et al. 2004), and sampled the conformations of the two short linker regions using fragment assembly techniques (Leaver-Fay et al. 2011). The RNA was built in two segments taken from the TIS11d complex, one anchored in the N-terminal zinc finger and one in the C-terminal finger. We modeled multiple 3′ splice site sequences (primarily variants of uuAG|ruu) and explored a range of possible alignments of the 3′ splice site within the complex. The final register was selected on the basis of energetic analysis and manual inspection using known features of the specificity pattern of the 3′ splice site (in particular, the lack of a significant genomic consensus at the −4 and +3 positions, consistent with the experimental absence of a crosslink between U2AF1 and the −4 position) (Wu et al. 1999).  Based on these simulations, we propose a theoretical model of U2AF1 in complex with RNA wherein the zinc finger domains guide recognition of the yAG|r motif, consistent with the predictions of our mutational data. The model has the following features (Fig. 6A; Supplemental File S6). The first zinc finger contacts the bases immediately preceding the splice site, including the AG dinucleotide (Fig. 6B,C), while the second zinc finger binds immediately downstream (Fig. 6D). The RNA is kinked at the splice site and bent overall throughout the complex so that both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the motif are oriented toward the UHM domain and U2AF2 peptide. Contacts compatible with the 3′ splice site consensus are observed at the sequence-constrained RNA positions. The mutated positions S34 and Q157 are near the bases at which perturbed splice site preferences are observed for their respective mutations. Moreover, the modified preferences can, to some extent, be rationalized by contacts seen in our simulations. S34 forms a hydrogen bond with U(−1), and preference for U at −1 appears to decrease upon mutation; the Q157P mutation would improve electrostatic complementarity with G at +1 by removing a backbone NH group, in agreement with increased G preference in this mutant.  Figure 6. Figure 6. Theoretical model of the U2AF1:RNA complex. (A) Overview, with the zinc finger domains colored cyan, the RNA in salmon, the UHM beta sheet in blue, and alpha helices in red. The frequently mutated positions S34 and Q157 are shown in stick representation. ... Go to: Discussion Here, we have described the mechanistic consequences of U2AF1 mutations in hematopoietic cells and provided a catalog of splicing changes driven by each common U2AF1 mutation. U2AF1 mutations cause highly specific alterations in 3′ splice site recognition in myeloid neoplasms. Taken together with the high frequency of mutations targeting U2AF1 and genes encoding other 3′ splice site recognition factors, our results support the hypothesis that specific alterations in 3′ splice site recognition are important contributors to the molecular pathology of MDS and related hematological disorders.  We observed consistent differential splicing of multiple genes, such as DNMT3B and FANCA, that participate in molecular pathways previously implicated in blood disease. It is tempting to speculate that differential splicing of a few such genes in well-characterized pathways explain how U2AF1 mutations drive disease. However, we instead hypothesize that spliceosomal mutations contribute to dysplastic hematopoiesis and tumorigenesis by dysregulating a multitude of genes involved in many aspects of cell physiology. This hypothesis is consistent with two notable features of our data. First, hundreds of exons are differentially spliced in response to U2AF1 mutations. Second, many of the splicing changes are relatively modest. In both the AML and K562 data, we observed relatively few isoform switches, with the ATR and CASP8 examples illustrated in Figure 3 being notable exceptions. Therefore, we expect that specific targets such as DNMT3B probably contribute to, but do not wholly explain, U2AF1 mutation-induced pathophysiology. As additional data from tumor transcriptome sequencing become available—for example, as more patient transcriptomes carrying Q157 mutations are sequenced—precisely identifying disease-relevant changes in splicing will become increasingly reliable.  Our understanding of the molecular consequences of U2AF1 mutations will also benefit from further experiments conducted during the differentiation process. Both the AML and K562 data arose from relatively “static” systems, in the sense that the bulk of the assayed cells were not actively undergoing lineage specification. U2AF1 mutations likely cause similar changes in splice site recognition in both precursor and more differentiated cells, but altered splice site recognition could have additional consequences in specific cell types. A recent study reported that regulated intron retention is important for granulopoiesis (Wong et al. 2013), consistent with the idea that as-yet-unrecognized shifts in RNA processing may occur during hematopoiesis. By disrupting such global processes, altered splice site recognition could contribute to the ineffective hematopoiesis that characterizes MDS.  Relevance to future studies of spliceosomal mutations  Both mechanistic and phenotypic studies of cancer-associated somatic mutations frequently focus on single mutations, even when multiple distinct mutations affecting that gene occur at high rates. Similarly, distinct mutations affecting the same gene are frequently grouped together in prognostic and other clinical studies, thereby implicitly assuming that different mutations have similar physiological consequences. Our finding that different U2AF1 mutations are not mechanistically equivalent illustrates the value of studying all high-frequency mutations when feasible. The distinctiveness of S34 and Q157 mutation-induced alterations in 3′ splice site preference suggests that they could theoretically constitute clinically relevant disease subtypes, potentially contributing to the heterogeneity of MDS. Mutations affecting other spliceosomal genes may likewise have allele-specific consequences. For example, mutations at codons 625 versus 700 of SF3B1 are most commonly associated with uveal melanoma (Harbour et al. 2013; Martin et al. 2013) versus MDS (Graubert et al. 2011; Papaemmanuil et al. 2011; Yoshida et al. 2011; Visconte et al. 2012) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Quesada et al. 2011). Accordingly, we speculate that stratifying patients by mutation could prove fruitful for future studies of spliceosomal gene mutations.  Our study additionally illustrates how investigating disease-associated somatic mutations can give insight into the normal function of proteins. With a fairly restricted set of assumptions, we computationally predicted a family of models in which the first zinc finger of U2AF1 recognizes the AG dinucleotide of the 3′ splice site. As a computational prediction, the model must be tested with future experiments. Nonetheless, given the concordance between our theoretical model of U2AF1:RNA interactions and our mutational data, this model may provide a useful framework for future studies of U2AF1 function in both healthy and diseased cells.  Go to: Methods Vector construction and cell culture  Inserts encoding bicistronic constructs of the form U2AF1 + Gly Gly + FLAG + T2A + mCherry were created by standard methods (details in Supplemental Methods). These inserts were cloned into the self-inactivating lentiviral vector pRRLSIN.cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE (Addgene Plasmid 12252). The resulting plasmids coexpress U2AF1 and mCherry under control of the PGK promoter. K562 erythroleukemia cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. To generate stable cell lines, K562 cells were infected with concentrated lentiviral supernatants at a MOI of ∼5 in growth media supplemented with 8 μg/mL protamine sulfate. Cells were then expanded, and transduced cells expressing mCherry were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using a Becton Dickinson FACSAria II equipped with a 561-nm laser. For RNAi studies, K562 cells were transfected with a control (nontargeting) siRNA (Dharmacon D-001810-03-20) or a siRNA pool against U2AF1 (Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool L-012325-01-0005) using the Nucleofector II device from Lonza with the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V (program T16), and RNA and protein were collected 48 h after transfection.  mRNA sequencing  Total RNA was obtained by lysing 10 million K562 cells for each sample in TRIzol, and RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy columns. Using 4 μg of total RNA, we prepared poly(A)-selected, unstranded libraries for Illumina sequencing using a modified version of the TruSeq protocol (details in Supplemental Methods). RNA-seq libraries were then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 to a depth of ∼100 million 2 × 49 bp reads per sample.  Accession numbers  For the AML analysis, BAM files were downloaded from CGHub (“LAML” project) and converted to FASTQ files of unaligned reads for subsequent read mapping. For the HeLa cell analysis, FASTQ files were downloaded from DDBJ series DRA000503 (http://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/), and the reads were trimmed to 50 bp (after removing the first five bp) to restrict to the high-quality portion of the reads. A similar trimming procedure was performed in the original manuscript (Yoshida et al. 2011).  Genome annotations and read mapping  MISO v2.0 annotations were used for cassette exon, competing 5′ and 3′ splice sites, and retained intron events (Katz et al. 2010). Constitutive junctions were defined as splice junctions that were not alternatively spliced in any isoform of the UCSC knownGene track (Meyer et al. 2013). For read mapping purposes, a gene annotation file was created by combining isoforms from the MISO v2.0 (Katz et al. 2010), UCSC knownGene (Meyer et al. 2013), and Ensembl 71 (Flicek et al. 2013) annotations for the UCSC hg19 (NCBI GRCh37) human genome assembly, and a splice junction annotation file was created by enumerating all possible combinations of annotated splice sites as previously described (Hubert et al. 2013). RSEM (Li and Dewey 2011) and Bowtie (Langmead et al. 2009) were used to map reads to the gene annotation file, and TopHat (Trapnell et al. 2009) was used to align remaining unaligned reads to the genome and splice junctions (full details in Supplemental Methods).  Isoform expression measurements  MISO (Katz et al. 2010) and v2.0 of its annotations were used to quantify isoform ratios for annotated alternative splicing events, and alternative splicing of constitutive junctions and retention of constitutive introns was quantified with junction reads as previously described (Hubert et al. 2013). All analyses were restricted to splicing events with at least 20 relevant reads (reads supporting either or both isoforms) that were alternatively spliced in our data. Events were defined as differentially spliced between two samples if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) at least 20 relevant reads in both samples; (2) a change in isoform ratio of at least 10%; and (3) a Bayes factor ≥ 2.5 (AML data) or 5 (K562 data). Because the AML data had approximately twofold lower read coverage than the K562 data, we reduced the Bayes factor by a factor of two to compensate for the loss in statistical power. Wagenmakers’ framework (Wagenmakers et al. 2010) was used to compute Bayes factors for differences in isoform ratios between samples. A description of the isoform-specific PCR used for Supplemental Figure S5 is given in Supplemental Methods. To identify splicing events that were differentially spliced in AML S34 samples versus WT samples (Supplemental File S1), we used the Mann-Whitney U test and required P < 0.01. To identify splicing events that were differentially spliced in each AML sample with a U2AF1 mutation (Fig. 4A; Supplemental Fig. S6), each U2AF1 mutant sample was compared to an average U2AF1 WT sample. The average U2AF1 WT sample was created by averaging isoform ratios over all 162 U2AF1 WT samples.  Cluster analysis, sequence logos, and gene ontology enrichment  To perform the cluster analysis of AML transcriptomes (Fig. 1C) and K562 cells (Fig. 2C), we identified cassette exons that displayed changes in isoform ratios ≥ 10% across the samples and then further restricted to cassette exons with at least 100 informative reads across all samples. An informative read is defined as a RNA-seq read that supports either isoform, but not both. We created a similarity matrix using the Pearson correlation computed from the z-score normalized cassette exon inclusion values and clustered the samples using Ward’s method. Sequence logos were created with v1.26.0 of the seqLogo package in Bioconductor (Gentleman et al. 2004). Gene ontology analysis was performed with GOseq (Young et al. 2010) and is described further in Supplemental Methods.  Western blotting  Protein lysates from K562 cells pellets were generated by resuspension in RIPA buffer and protease inhibitor along with sonication. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay. Ten micrograms of protein was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody 1:1000 anti-U2AF1 (Bethyl Laboratories, catalog no. A302-080A), anti-FLAG (Thermo, catalog no. MA1-91878), anti-Histone H3 (Abcam, catalog no. ab1791), or anti-alpha-tubulin (Sigma, catalog no. T9026) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed with TBS containing 0.005% Tween 20 and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.  Minigenes  An insert containing the ATR genomic locus (Chr 3: 142168344–142172070) or EPB49 genomic locus (Chr 8: 21938036–21938724) was cloned into the EcoRV site of pUB6/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen) by Gibson assembly cloning (NEB). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate different nucleotides at the −3 position of the 3′ splice site. Details of minigene transfection and real-time PCR are specified in Supplemental Methods.  In vitro splicing  A pre-mRNA substrate transcribed from the AdML derivative HMS388 was used in all splicing reactions (Jurica et al. 2002; Reichert et al. 2002). T7 runoff transcription was used to generate G(5′)ppp(5′)G-capped radiolabeled pre-mRNA using UTP [α-32P], and K562 nuclear extracts were isolated following a published protocol (Folco et al. 2012) with a minor modification. Pre-mRNA substrates were incubated in standard splicing conditions, and RNA species were separated in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized using a phosphoimager (full details in Supplemental Methods). For quantification in Figure 5, each species was normalized by subtracting the background and then dividing by the number of uracil nucleotides in that species. The percentage of the second step products was calculated by dividing the second step species (spliced mRNA and lariat intron) by the total of all species in the lane.  Protein structure prediction  Models of U2AF1 (residues 9–174) in complex with a RNA fragment extending from the 3′ splice site positions −4 to +3 were built by combining template-based modeling, fragment assembly methods, and all-atom refinement. Models were built using the software package Rosetta (Leaver-Fay et al. 2011) with template coordinate data taken from the UHM:ULM complex structure (Kielkopf et al. 2001) (PDB ID 1jmt: residues A/46–143) and the TIS11d:RNA complex structure (Hudson et al. 2004) (PDB ID 1rgo: U2AF1 residues 16–37 mapped to A/195–216; residues 155–174 mapped to A/159–179; RNA positions −4 to −1 mapped to D/1–4; RNA positions +1 to +3 mapped to D/7–9). The remainder of the modeled region (residues 9–15, 38–45, and 144–154) was built using fragment assembly (with templated regions held internally fixed) in a low-resolution representation (backbone heavy atoms and side chain centroids) and force field. The fragment assembly simulation consisted of 6000 fragment-replacement trials, for which fragments of size 6 (trials 1–3000), 3 (trials 3001–5000), and 1 (trials 5001–6000) were used. The RNA was modeled in two pieces, one anchored in the N-terminal zinc finger and the other in the C-terminal zinc finger, with docking geometries taken from the TIS11d:RNA complex. A pseudo-energy term favoring chain closure was added to the potential function to reward closure of the chain break between the RNA fragments. The fragment assembly simulation was followed by all-atom refinement during which all side chains as well as the nontemplated protein backbone and the RNA were flexible. Roughly 100,000 independent model building simulations were conducted, each with a different random number seed and using a randomly selected member of the 1rgo NMR ensemble as a template. Low-energy final models were clustered to identify frequently sampled conformations (the model depicted in Fig. 5A was the center of the largest cluster). We explored a range of possible alignments of the splice site RNA within the complex, with the final model selected on the basis of all-atom energies, RNA chain closure, manual inspection, and known sequence features of the 3′ splice site motif. We previously identified missense mutations in the U2AF1 splicing factor affecting codons S34 (S34F and S34Y) or Q157 (Q157R and Q157P) in 11% of patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Although the role of U2AF1 as an accessory factor in the U2 snRNP is well established, it is not yet clear how mutations affect splicing or contribute to MDS pathophysiology. We analyzed splice junctions in RNA-seq data generated from transfected CD34+ hematopoietic cells and found significant differences in the abundance of known and novel junctions in samples expressing mutant U2AF1 (S34F). For selected transcripts, splicing alterations detected by RNA-seq were confirmed by analysis of primary de novo MDS patient samples. These effects were not due to impaired U2AF1 (S34F) localization as it co-localized normally with U2AF2 within nuclear speckles. We further found evidence in the RNA-seq data for decreased affinity of U2AF1 (S34F) for uridine (relative to cytidine) at the e-3 position immediately upstream of the splice acceptor site and corroborated this finding using affinity binding assays. These data suggest that the S34F mutation alters U2AF1 function in the context of specific RNA sequences, leading to aberrant alternative splicing of target genes, some of which may be relevant for MDS pathogenesis.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Recent studies have revealed that core spliceosome components are targets of recurrent mutation in a variety of hematopoietic malignancies. Splicing factor mutations, particularly in SF3B1, U2AF1 and SRSF2, are present in approximately 50% of MDS cases, making them the most common class of mutations in this disease.1-6 These mutations are also common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), occurring with a frequency of ~14%,7 and SF3B1 is the second most frequently mutated gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.8-10  U2AF1 encodes the 35 kDa auxiliary factor for the U2 pre-mRNA splicing complex and recognizes the 3’ AG dinucleotide at the splice acceptor site in a pre-mRNA intron.11, 12 U2AF1 has four domains: a U2AF homology motif (UHM), two zinc finger (ZnF) domains, and an arginine-serine (RS) domain.13 U2AF1 heterodimerizes with U2AF2 through its UHM domain,13,14 and U2AF2 in turn binds the pre-mRNA as a complex with SF1.15 This U2AF1 interaction leads to the recruitment and stabilization of U2AF binding to degenerate pre-mRNA polypyrimidine (Py) tracts.16 U2AF1 also interacts directly with serine-arginine (SR) splice factors SRSF1 and SRSF2,17 and interacts either directly or indirectly with other factors during spliceosome assembly.18  11 distinct mutations have been reported in U2AF1, including 9 missense mutations (resulting in A26V, S34F/Y, R35L, R156H/Q, Q157P/R, or G213A substitutions) and 2 frame- shift mutations (affecting codons Q157 or E159).1, 2, 6, 19-22 Most of these mutations occur within the two ZnF domains of U2AF1, with S34 and Q157 being the most commonly mutated residues. In our previous analysis in MDS, the S34F substitution was the most common (66.7%), followed by Q157P (16.7%), S34Y (11%) and Q157R (5.6%) out of 18 total U2AF1 mutations.1, 22  We previously reported that mutant U2AF1 (S34F) causes increased exon skipping and cryptic/alternative splice site utilization in minigene assays.1 In addition, other groups have observed differential splicing resulting from exon inclusion and skipping in AML patient samples with S34F (n=4) or S34Y (n=2) mutations.20 Overexpression of U2AF1 (S34F) suppresses growth and proliferation, and increases the rate of apoptosis in HeLa cells in vitro. Hematopoietic stem cells (CD34−KSL) expressing the S34F, Q157P or Q157R mutations have reduced capability to reconstitute recipient mouse bone marrow.2 Collectively, these studies provide evidence that the S34F mutation affects not only U2AF1 function but may also alter hematopoiesis.  While there have been attempts to understand the global impact of the S34F mutant on splicing and gene expression using transcriptome sequencing (i.e., RNA-seq), the genetic heterogeneity of primary MDS and AML poses challenges for discovery of target genes and no consistently dysregulated genes have been reported. It is also unclear what role the ZnF domains play and whether mutations in the S34 and Q157 residues possibly alter U2AF1 interactions with RNA or result in mis-localization.  We performed transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on CD34+ hematopoietic cells to assess the global impact of mutant U2AF1 on splicing and gene expression. We found that U2AF1 (S34F) affects pre-mRNA splicing of a large number of target genes, some of which are known oncogenic drivers, and preferentially skips splice acceptor sites immediately adjacent to uridine at the −3 position. We also determined the effect of the S34F substitution on sub-cellular localization and on the RNA binding specificity of U2AF1 for a representative affected splice site and U and C-variants at the e-3 position. Finally, we examined the effect of a spectrum of U2AF1 mutations on splicing activity.  Go to: METHODS RNA sequencing  Human hematopoietic mononuclear cells (MNCs) were separated from cord blood using density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll Paque, GE Healthcare). CD34+ cells were isolated from MNCs using the CD34 MicroBead kit (Miltenyi Biotec) on an autoMACs magnetic separator. These cells were cultured in SFEMII media (Stemcell Technologies) supplemented with IL-3, SCF, FLT-3 and TPO cytokines. WT and S34F U2AF1 cDNAs were generated, as previously described,1 and then cloned into pcDNA3.1-Ires-GFP (PIG) to create PIG-U2AF1 (WT or S34F). CD34+ cells then were transfected with PIG-U2AF1 (WT or S34F) using the Nucleofector Kit for Human CD34+ Cells (Lonza). GFP+CD34+ cells were sorted 24 hours later, followed by RNA extraction using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Ribosomal RNA was depleted (Ribozero, Epicenter), followed by cDNA preparation and Illumina library production. Sequencing was performed on the HiSeq2000 platform (Illumina). Bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data is described in the supplementary material.  RNA-seq validation  RT-PCR followed by gel electrophoresis was carried out using RNA isolated from independent CD34+ samples, transfected and purified as described above. RNA extraction and cDNA preparation from patient samples has been previously described.1 Primers used for validation can be found in Supplementary Table 5 and were designed to span the splice junction such that both the canonical and alternatively spliced isoforms are amplified. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to quantify mRNA expression was performed using Taqman 2X Universal mix on the 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Bioscience) and analyzed using the relative quantification of comparative CT method.  RNA affinities of purified U2AF1 protein complexes  Fluorescence anisotropy changes were monitored during titration of fluorescein-labeled RNAs with purified protein complexes comprising U2AF2 (residues 85-471 at the C-terminus of NCBI RefSeq NP_001012496, isoform b), SF1 (residues 1-255 of NCBI RefSeq NP_004621) with either WT U2AF1 (residues 1-193 of NCBI RefSeq NP_006749) or the S34F mutant. Proteins were full-length with the exception of the nonspecific U2AF RS domains, and for SF1, a proline-rich C-terminal domain. The protein complex purification is explained in supplementary material. The 5’-labeled fluorescein RNAs (sequences DEK-“skipped”(UAG): 5’- UAAGAAAUACUAAAUUAAUUUCUAG AAAAGAGUCUCA; DEK-“skipped”-CAG: 5’- UAAGAAAUACUAAAUUAAUUUCCAG AAAAGAGUCUCA; DEK-“spliced”(CAG) 5’- AAUUGUGAUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCAG GAAAGGGGCAGA; DEK-“spliced”-UAG: 5’- AAUUGUGAUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCAG GAAAGGGGCAGA; the three nucleotides preceding 3’ splice site junction are underlined) were synthesized and purified (ThermoScientific Dharmacon). Fluorescence anisotropy changes were measured at 520 nm following excitation at 490 nm using a Fluoromax-3 (Horiba Ltd.) equipped with microcuvette (Starna Cells Inc.). An RNA stock (0.75 mM) was diluted to 25 nM and the protein complex stocks (20 μM) were diluted to the final concentrations shown in Supplementary Figure 5B. The protein and RNA buffer composition for the binding experiments was 25 mM HEPES pH 6.8, 150 mM NaCl, 25 μM ZnCl2 and 1 mM TCEP. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants were fit, as previously described.23  Minigene constructs and transfection  To create the MIG (MND Ires GFP)-U2AF1-Flag plasmid, U2AF1-Flag cDNA was amplified from the p3X-Flag-U2AF1 plasmid (obtained from the Kinji Ohno laboratory, Nagoya, Japan) and cloned into the MND-Ires-GFP (MIG) vector.24 The S34F, S34Y, S34F/Q157R, Q157R and Q157P mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Life Technologies) using the WT MIG-U2AF1-Flag construct as a template. 293T cells were co-transfected with each MIG-U2AF1-Flag expression plasmid described above and either the GH1 or FMR1 minigene reporter constructs described previously.1, 25 GFP+ cells were sorted 48 hours later, followed by RNA extraction and RT-PCR as previously described.1 Amplicons were visualized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified by densitometry (ImageJ). Three independent experiments were performed for each assay and analyzed using the Student’s t-test. Lysates were made from transfected 293T cells and immunoblotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-U2AF1 antibody (Abcam) to confirm over-expression.  Sub-cellular localization  Constructs containing the S34F mutant allele were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of p3X-Flag-U2AF1. 293T cells were transfected with either p3X- Flag-U2AF1 (WT) or p3X-Flag-U2AF1 (S34F). 24 hours later, the cells were fixed in 2-4% formaldehyde-PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and then washed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% (wt/vol) Triton X-100/PBS for 10 minutes and blocked with 1% goat serum/0.3%TritonX-100/PBS for 1 hour. The following primary antibodies were used for fluorescence microscopy: mouse monoclonal antibodies against Smith Antigen snRNP family (Y12; Abcam) or U2AF2 (Sigma), and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-mouse (Sigma) as a secondary antibody. Monoclonal anti-Flag M2-FITC (Sigma) used to detect Flag-tagged U2AF1 and TOPRO (Life Technologies) used as a nuclear counterstain. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with a 63X, 1.4 numerical aperture, Zeiss Plan Apochromat oil objective at 2.5 zoom and captured using Zeiss LSM510 software.  Go to: RESULTS The S34F mutation affects pre-mRNA splicing  We transfected primary human CD34+ hematopoietic cells with U2AF1 (either WT or the S34F mutant) and performed RNA-seq to comprehensively determine the effects of the S34F mutant on pre-mRNA splicing and gene expression. We isolated cells 24 hours after transfection in order to identify immediate splicing changes induced by mutant U2AF1, while minimizing alterations that may occur with prolonged time in culture or as a consequence of secondary adaptations to altered splicing. Total reads of the raw sequence output ranged from 300 to 500 million per sample (Supplementary Figure 1A). Unique reads mappable to the human transcriptome were similar across all samples except for one outlier (S34F sample in replicate R3), whose replicate was excluded from further analysis (Supplementary Figure 1B). The distribution of mapped bases (coding, untranslated (UTR), intergenic, intronic and ribosomal bases) was similar for all 8 samples, with coding and UTR comprising 60-80% of the bases (Supplementary Figure 1C). As expected, reads mapped to U2AF1 exon 2 demonstrated a G>A substitution only in cells transfected with the mutant cDNA (Supplementary Figure 1D). In these samples, mutant U2AF1 represented 85- 97% of total U2AF1 expression, after normalizing for total mapped reads in each sample. Subsequent analyses capitalize on the paired experimental design (i.e., the same pool of CD34+ cells transfected with either WT or mutant U2AF1, repeated in 3 biological replicates). The ratio of total U2AF1 expression (measured by FPKM) between mutant and WT samples were consistent across pairs (5.78, 2.49, 3.66 for R1, R2, and R4, respectively).  Though unsupervised clustering using adjusted expression levels (see Supplementary Methods) of 17,390 genes segregated samples based on genotype (mutant vs WT samples; Supplementary Figure 2A), lengths of dendrogram branches connecting samples within a genotype are similar to lengths of branches connecting samples of different genotypes. This indicates that the samples do not strongly cluster by genotype and that there is no strong, acute, global, gene-level effect induced by U2AF1 (S34F). To focus on those relatively few genes that were affected by U2AF1 (S34F), we applied edgeR, a statistical approach based on total counts of reads mapped to a gene that incorporates the experiment's paired design for improved power. This revealed that 1,296 genes were differentially expressed between paired WT U2AF1 and U2AF1 (S34F) samples (FDR < 5%). Hierarchical clustering of these differentially expressed genes (supervised at the 5% FDR cutoff) segregated mutant and WT samples, as expected (Supplementary Figure 2B).  We next analyzed junction-level expression (using edgeR and total reads mapped to a junction) to assess the effect of U2AF1 (S34F) on global splicing activity. We discovered that mutant U2AF1 alters pre-mRNA splicing of expressed junctions in 6% (959/15,687, FDR<5%) of genes (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 3A-B and Supplementary Table 2). Of the 959 genes alternatively spliced junctions, 241 (FDR<5%) were also differentially expressed at the gene level in S34F samples compared to WT (Supplementary Figure 3B and Supplementary Table 2). These expression differences involved known splice junctions (present in Ensembl, release 67), and novel junctions resulting from: 1) known splice acceptor and donor sites (novel junction involving a donor and acceptor that are individually present in Ensembl transcripts, but which have not been observed in combination), 2) known splice acceptor and novel (not present in Ensembl) splice donor sites, 3) novel splice acceptor and known splice donor sites, or 4) novel splice acceptor and donor sites (Supplementary Figure 3A). Both the known and novel junctions reflected an increase or decrease in mRNA isoforms due to alternative splicing, including exon skipping, alternative 3’ or 5’ splice site usage, and events that involved usage of both the alternative 5’ and 3’ splice sites (Supplementary Figure 3C; Supplementary Table 2). Next, we identified altered junctions differing by at least 4-fold in mutant vs. WT expressing samples. We discovered significant differences in the abundance of 544 out 202,401 total junctions (FDR<5%, | log2(fold change) | > 2) in cells expressing U2AF1 (S34F), compared with WT [known splice junctions (280/170,321; 0.16%); novel splice junctions (264/31,180; 0.85%)] (Figure 1A-D; Supplementary Table 2). Reads from novel junctions resulting from both novel acceptor and donor sites were not analyzed further.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Overexpression of U2AF1 (S34F) alters the distribution of known and novel splice junctions We selected 24 junctions with higher expression (FDR<5%; | log2(fold change) | >2) in U2AF1 (S34F) samples for validation in independently prepared CD34+ cells. Of these, we validated 10/20 known junctions (Figure 2A-B and Supplementary Figure 4A-C, left panels) and 4/4 novel junctions (Supplementary Figure 4D). 10 of the validated changes were further tested in primary clinical samples [n=6 MDS bone marrow samples with U2AF1 (S34F) vs. n=6 MDS controls with no U2AF1 splicing mutations] and 5 were confirmed, including junctions resulting from alternative splicing due to exon skipping in DEK and SMN1 and 3’ alternative site usage in SERPIN8B, KIAA1033, and IFI44 (Figure 2A-B and Supplementary Figure 4A-B, right panels). As further independent validation of the 544 junctions, we assessed their differential expression between 6 S34(F/Y) U2AF1 mutant AML patient samples and 108 control AML samples in publically-available TCGA RNA-seq data.26 Other than the S34 variants in the 6 mutant samples, none of the samples had nucleotide mutations or copy number alternations in U2AF1 or any of 272 other splicing factors. 10 junctions had statistically significant (FDR < 5%) dysregulation with concordant fold change, i.e., in the same direction as detected in CD34+ cells (p-value < 10−3; Supplementary Table 3).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Exon skipping and alternative splice site usage increased in U2AF1 (S34F) mutant samples It has been shown previously that U2AF1 is not required for splicing of introns containing strong Py tracts,27 but it is important for splicing of introns that contain short or weak Py tracts.11, 28, 29 To determine whether there were sequence differences in the 3’ splice sites of junctions affected by U2AF1 (S34F), we analyzed sequences flanking (from −20 to +3 bps) the 3’ AG dinucleotide (the binding site for U2AF1). We focused on exon skipping and alternative 3’ site usage events, as these represent the majority of dysregulated events (Supplementary Figure 3C). An exon-skipping event was defined as skipping of a single cassette exon (Figure 3A). An alternative 3’ usage event resulted in partial loss of an exon due to skipping of the canonical junction and usage of a single alternative 3’ splice site down-stream of the canonical 3’ splice site (Figure 3B). When we analyzed the 3’ splice sites of skipped exons, we found that there was a high frequency of uridine (U) at position e-3 in exons that were skipped more by U2AF1 (S34F) compared to those skipped more in WT [S34F>WT: 81/111 (73%); WT>S34F: 10/68 (15%); p=8.5x10−15] (Figure 3A), consistent with previously reported findings.20, 30 The 3’ canonical junctions skipped more by U2AF1 (S34F) also had a higher frequency of U at position e-3 [S34F>WT: 64/101 (63%); WT>S34F: 22/101 (22%); p=3.7x10−9] (Figure 3B, left panel), and resulted in increased 3’ alternative cryptic splice site usage, consistent with a recent report.30 We then analyzed the 3’ alternative cryptic splice site to determine whether there was a sequence preference for the S34F mutant. As seen with skipped exons, there was a higher frequency of uridine (U) at the e-3 position of the skipped junctions expressed more in U2AF1 (S34F) compared to WT [71/101 (70%); WT>S34F: 38/101 (38%); p=5.2x10−6] (Figure 3B, right panel). No other apparent differences in base preferences were noted in the Py tract preceding the 3’ AG dinucleotide of the skipped exons or junctions. As a control, we analyzed junctions that showed no evidence for differential expression by U2AF1 (S34F) [ | log2(fold change) | < 0.001] (Figure 3C). We did not observe any differences in sequences at the 5’ splice site of skipped exons, or at 5’ sites of exons with alternative 5’ or 3’ splice sites (Supplementary Figure 3D and data not shown), consistent with the known activity of U2AF1 which is restricted to 3’ splice sites. Collectively, these data suggest that the 3’ splice sites that are more frequently skipped by U2AF1 (S34F) are enriched for U at e-3, while alternative sites utilized more frequently by the mutant are enriched for C at e-3. We examined junctions that were validated in patient samples and found that all validated junctions (5/5) had U at position e-3 at skipped junctions, suggesting that this consensus sequence enriches for true positive junctions that are preferentially skipped by U2AF1 (S34F) (Supplementary Table 4).  Figure 3 Figure 3 The U2AF1 (S34F) mutant recognizes the uridine at position e-3 of the 3’ splice site less frequently The S34F mutation alters the affinity of pre-mRNA to U2AF1  The enhanced exon skipping and alternative 3’ splice site usage seen with the U2AF1 (S34F) mutant could be due to altered binding of U2AF1 to canonical 3’ AG (acceptor site). To explore this further, we compared the RNA affinities of WT and S34F-mutant U2AF1 for splice sites from a representative affected transcript, the DEK oncogene, where a U at position e-3 (i.e., UAG) was skipped in favor of splicing into a CAG splice site. The DEK1-“skipped” RNA oligo comprised the intron/exon region of the splice acceptor site of exon 3 (skipped by S34F mutant U2AF1) whereas the DEK- “spliced” RNA oligo comprised the downstream intron/exon 4 sequence that is preferentially spliced into by the mutant (Figure 4A). To better emulate the context of the assembling spliceosome, we used ternary complexes of either wild-type U2AF1 (residues 1-193) or the S34F mutant with accessory protein subunits for the early stage of 3’ splice site recognition: U2AF2 (residues 85-471 at the C-terminus) and SF1 (residues 1-255) (Figure 4B, Supplementary Figure 5A). Both of the U2AF proteins were full length with the exception of the nonspecific RS domains. For SF1, a C-terminal proline-rich domain thought to interact with 5’ splice site subunits was truncated. The RNA oligos were fluorescein-labeled and the RNA affinities were determined from anisotropy changes during titration with the purified protein complexes (Supplementary Figure 5B). Consistent with S34F-dependent skipping of the corresponding DEK splice site, the DEK-“skipped” RNA oligo bound less avidly to mutant U2AF1 (S34F) compared with WT (Figure 4C). The nearly identical binding of mutant or WT U2AF1 to the DEK-“spliced” RNA oligo also was consistent with the similar splicing of the downstream splice site in normal and mutant U2AF1 samples.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Comparison of the WT and S34F U2AF1 affinities for splice sites from a representative affected transcript, the DEK oncogene Based on the preferential, S34F-dependent skipping of junctions with U at position e-3 and splicing of junctions with C at position e-3 in the presence of mutant U2AF1 (S34F), we next tested the RNA sequence discrimination of the WT and S34F mutant protein complexes for the C or U e-3 variants of the DEK splice sites (Figure 4A). Alteration of the UAG in the skipped DEK sequence to CAG (DEK-“skipped”-CAG, Figure 4A) increased the affinity for both the U2AF1 protein complexes and to a significantly greater extent for the S34F-mutant (2-fold and 9-fold higher affinity for the WT and S34F proteins, respectively) (Figure 4C). Conversely, alteration of the CAG in the downstream, spliced DEK sequence to UAG (DEK-“spliced”-UAG, Figure 4A) decreased the affinity for both the U2AF1 protein complexes with a significantly greater penalty for the S34F mutant (factors of 2 and 6 affinity decrease for the WT and S34F proteins, respectively) (Figure 4C). These data demonstrate that the S34F mutation alters the sequence specificity of the ternary U2AF1 complex in favor of binding splice sites comprising C at e-3 and discriminates against splice sites comprising U at the e-3 position.  The S34F mutation does not affect U2AF1 localization within nuclear speckles  U2AF1 is diffusely distributed in the nucleoplasm and localizes within the nuclear speckles (sites of spliceosome assembly).31, 32 Using fluorescence immunocytochemistry on U2AF1-Flag (WT or S34F) transfected 293T cells, we found that U2AF1 (S34F) localized normally (Supplementary Figure 6A). Furthermore, U2AF1 (S34F) co-localized with U2AF2 and Smith Antigen family of snRNP proteins (Y12 antibody) in a similar pattern as WT (Supplementary Figure 6B), suggesting that the altered splicing activity of U2AF1 (S34F) was not due to abnormal trafficking of the mutant protein.  Specific effects of U2AF1 mutations in alternative splicing  Apart from the S34F substitution, there are 10 other reported somatic mutations in U2AF1 that may affect its function. Since mutations at codons S34 and Q157 are the most common, we utilized GH1 and FMR1 minigenes1, 25 to determine the effect of substitutions at these positions on splicing activity. The GH1 or FMR1 minigene was transiently co-transfected with either MND-IRES-GFP (MIG; empty vector) or MIG-U2AF1-Flag (WT, S34F, S34Y, S34F/Q157R, Q157R or Q157P alleles) into 293T cells. Over-expression was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure 5A; Supplementary Figure 7A) and Western blot analysis (Figure 5B; Supplementary Figure 7B). Isoform a represents the canonical isoform, and isoforms b and c (if present) are the alternatively spliced isoforms. In GH1, isoform b results from exon skipping and in FMR1 isoforms b and c result from alternative 3’ splice site usage. U2AF1 (S34F) yielded the most significant increase in alternative splicing activity for both GH1 and FMR1 (Figure 5C and D, respectively), consistent with previously published results.1 U2AF1 (S34Y) modestly enhanced relative expression of the alternative isoforms for both minigenes. Conversely, there was a reduction in relative expression of the alternative isoforms for both minigenes in cells expressing the Q157R (Figure 5C and D) and Q157P mutations (Supplementary Figure 7C and D). In cells expressing the S34F/Q157R double mutant (in which both the mutant S34F and Q157R occur on one allele, discovered in one patient with MDS1), GH1 splicing was indistinguishable from WT (Figure 5C) and there was a modest reduction in the relative expression of the alternative isoform of FMR1 (Figure 5D). Next, we examined the effects of different U2AF1 mutations on the splicing of endogenous DEK. Exon skipping in endogenous DEK was increased in 293T samples expressing S34F/Y, S34F/Q157R and Q157R mutants relative to WT (Figure 5E). As observed with the GH1 and FMR1 minigenes, the S34F mutant caused the most robust increase in alternative isoform b expression. However, unlike the GH1 and FMR1 minigenes, expression of the Q157R mutant resulted in increased alternative isoform splicing compared to WT expressing cells for DEK. Interestingly, analysis of TCGA AML RNA-seq data demonstrated that junctions differentially expressed in a sample with Q157P mutant U2AF1 vs. WT U2AF1 (| log2(fold change) | >1) do not share the signature at flanking sequences (C>U at e-3) that we detected in junctions differentially spliced by S34F U2AF1 (FDR <5%; Supplementary Figure 8). These results provide evidence that splicing is altered in a mutation-specific manner, but variable between specific junctions tested, with the most potent effects caused by U2AF1 (S34F) mutant.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Recurrent missense mutations in U2AF1 have specific effects on alternative splicing Go to: DISCUSSION Recent discoveries of recurrent mutations in core components of the pre-mRNA splicing complex highlight the potential importance of these genes in myelodysplastic syndromes. In this study, we used RNA-seq to detect global changes in splicing activity and isoform expression and discovered differences in expression of known and novel splice junctions. Our study is the first to analyze the impact of a mutant splicing factor on the transcriptome in a controlled genetic background in primary hematopoietic cells. So a consistent signature has not been defined for genes whose splicing is clearly affected by U2AF1 (S34F). Published results are conflicting, with one study reporting ~130 unspliced exons due to intron retention in mutant U2AF1-transfected HeLa cells2 while another (utilizing patient samples with a spectrum of splicing mutations) found no evidence for genome-wide intron retention, although these mutations did perturb TET2 splicing.6 Analysis of TCGA AML RNA-seq data revealed a predominance of exon skipping in 35 exons dysregulated by U2AF1 (S34F).20 The affected genes were involved in mitosis and RNA processing. Our results include a substantially larger number of alternative splicing events that were impacted by U2AF1 (S34F). Of the 35 genes that had significant exon skipping or retention in the data set from Pryzchodzen, et al.,20 only one gene (STRAP) overlaps with our results. When we validated the 544 junctions that were differential expressed in our RNA-seq data with the TCGA RNA-seq data, we found 10 genes that overlapped with our results, including STRAP and CCT6A. Although the DEK junction was not among these, the same DEK junction did have a p-value of 0.06 and concordant fold change in the TCGA data. Several characteristics of our experimental design may explain these largely non-overlapping results, including: (1) the use of CD34+ cells which have less genetic heterogeneity, compared to primary patient samples, (2) use of paired samples (S34F vs. WT), minimizing variability within biological replicates, and (3) differences in analytical approaches.  We found a higher frequency of uridine at the e-3 nucleotide in 3’ splice junctions that were skipped more often in U2AF1 (S34F) samples, including both exon skipping events and alternative 3’ splice site usage. These findings confirm previous observations related to exon skipping and alternative splice site usage.20, 30 This implies that there is selective or altered U2AF1 (S34F) binding to pre-mRNA at these junctions, possibly resulting from an increased affinity of U2AF1 (S34F) for C over U, relative to WT U2AF1, which we corroborated experimentally by determining the affinities of purified U2AF2/U2AF1 (WT or S34F) heterodimers for the affected splice sites of a representative example, DEK. Consistent with the S34F-affected splice site junctions, the S34F mutation selectively inhibited binding of the mutant U2AF1 complexes to the DEK splice site variants comprising U at the e-3 position. Conversely, substitution with a C at this position significantly increased U2AF1 (S34F) binding.  While it is not known which U2AF1 domain or domains directly bind RNA, the altered RNA binding affinity of the S34F mutant U2AF1 suggests that the ZnF domains are critical. The S34F mutation is in the first of these domains. In S. pombe, substitution of highly conserved cysteine residues (C18 and C149) to alanine of the ZnF domains results in lethality, and an RNA three-hybrid screen showed that these two ZnF domains are independently required for RNA binding of the U2AF heterodimer in yeast.33 Furthermore, the U2AF1 ZnF domains are predicted to be structurally similar to the murine and human ZFP36 family (both CX8CX5CX3H zinc fingers), which are known to bind RNA,34, 35 and our data suggest that the ZnF1 domain of U2AF1 may have this function. Rather than simply ablating function, the capacity of the S34F mutation to specifically discriminate between U and C at the e-3 position of the splice site junction implicates this residue in hydrogen bonds with the N3 or O4 positions of the pyrimidine base.  While mutant U2AF1 alters pre-mRNA splicing, the overall change in the total number of known and novel junctions is minimal, affecting (at an FDR <5%) fewer than 1% (1,594/201,501) of expressed junctions in 6% of analyzed genes. In addition, the proportion of isoforms induced by U2AF1 (S34F) expression is a small fraction of the total transcript for those genes. Collectively, these findings raise the possibility that disease pathogenesis induced by mutant U2AF1 may also be mediated through non-pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms that should be explored in future studies.  Finally, we discovered that the S34 and Q157 U2AF1 mutations have different effects on pre-mRNA splicing using GH1 and FMR1 minigenes. We detected an increase in relative expression of the alternative isoforms for both minigenes with S34 mutants, and a decrease in relative expression of these isoforms with Q157 mutants relative to WT, indicating that these mutations affect U2AF1-dependent splicing function differently depending on their location and the reporter junctions being queried (S34; ZnF1 and Q157; ZnF2). In fact, when splicing of endogenous DEK was analyzed following expression of U2AF1 (Q157R), a similar but less robust increase in alternative splicing was observed as seen with expression of U2AF1 (S34F). Junction analysis of one Q157P sample in the TCGA AML RNA-seq data adds credence to these findings. The differentially expressed junctions in this Q157P sample did not share the same signature at flanking sequences that were detected in junctions differentially spliced by S34F U2AF1 (C>U at e-3). These results suggest that there are differences in alternative splicing induced by S34F vs. Q157R/P mutations, but highlight the need for an unbiased transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) comparing expression of U2AF1 S34F vs. Q157R/P in order to elucidate the full extent of these similarities and differences. The splicing alterations detected with specific U2AF1 mutants may be shared by other splicing factors with recurrent mutations in myeloid neoplasms such as SF3B1, ZRSR2, SRSF2 and SF1 and common changes could serve as novel therapeutic targets across these diseases. Identifying important potential target genes that are affected by U2AF1 mutants is necessary for further understanding of their role in MDS and other cancers.  
1152||Whole-exome sequencing studies have identified common mutations affecting genes encoding components of the RNA splicing machinery in hematological malignancies. Here, we sought to determine how mutations affecting the 3′ splice site recognition factor U2AF1 alter its normal role in RNA splicing. We find that U2AF1 mutations influence the similarity of splicing programs in leukemias, but do not give rise to widespread splicing failure. U2AF1 mutations cause differential splicing of hundreds of genes, affecting biological pathways such as DNA methylation (DNMT3B), X chromosome inactivation (H2AFY), the DNA damage response (ATR, FANCA), and apoptosis (CASP8). We show that U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3′ splice site motif in patients, in cell culture, and in vitro. Mutations affecting the first and second zinc fingers give rise to different alterations in splice site preference and largely distinct downstream splicing programs. These allele-specific effects are consistent with a computationally predicted model of U2AF1 in complex with RNA. Our findings suggest that U2AF1 mutations contribute to pathogenesis by causing quantitative changes in splicing that affect diverse cellular pathways, and give insight into the normal function of U2AF1’s zinc finger domains.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of blood disorders characterized by dysplastic and ineffective hematopoiesis. Patients frequently suffer from cytopenias and are at increased risk for disease transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Tefferi and Vardiman 2009). The only curative treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, for which most patients are ineligible due to advanced age at diagnosis. The development of new therapies has been slowed by our incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease.  Recent sequencing studies of MDS patient exomes identified common mutations affecting genes encoding components of the RNA splicing machinery, with ∼45%–85% of patients affected (Graubert et al. 2011; Papaemmanuil et al. 2011; Yoshida et al. 2011; Visconte et al. 2012). Spliceosomal genes are the most common targets of somatic point mutations in MDS, suggesting that dysregulated splicing may constitute a common theme linking the disparate disorders that comprise MDS. Just four genes—SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2—carry the bulk of the mutations, which are mutually exclusive and occur in heterozygous contexts (Yoshida et al. 2011). Targeted sequencing studies identified high-frequency mutations in these genes in other hematological malignancies as well, including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and AML with myelodysplastic features (Yoshida et al. 2011). Of the four commonly mutated genes, SF3B1, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 encode proteins involved in 3′ splice site recognition (Shen et al. 2010; Cvitkovic and Jurica 2012), suggesting that altered 3′ splice site recognition is an important feature of the pathogenesis of MDS and related myeloid neoplasms.  U2AF1 (also known as U2AF35) may provide a useful model system to dissect the molecular consequences of MDS-associated spliceosomal gene mutations. U2AF1 mutations are highly specific—they uniformly affect the S34 and Q157 residues within the first and second CCCH zinc fingers of the protein—making comprehensive studies of all mutant alleles feasible (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, U2AF1’s biochemical role in binding the AG dinucleotide of the 3′ splice site is relatively well-defined (Merendino et al. 1999; Wu et al. 1999; Zorio and Blumenthal 1999). U2AF1 preferentially recognizes the core RNA sequence motif yAG|r (Fig. 1B), which matches the genomic consensus 3′ splice site and intron|exon boundary that crosslinks with U2AF1 (Wu et al. 1999). Nevertheless, our understanding of U2AF1:RNA interactions is incomplete. U2AF1’s U2AF homology motif (UHM) is known to mediate U2AF1:U2AF2 heterodimer formation (Kielkopf et al. 2001); however, both the specific protein domains that give rise to U2AF1’s RNA binding specificity and the normal function of U2AF1’s zinc fingers are unknown. Accordingly, the precise mechanistic consequences of U2AF1 mutations are difficult to predict.  Figure 1. Figure 1. U2AF1 mutations contribute to splicing programs in AML. (A) U2AF1 domain structure (Kielkopf et al. 2001; The UniProt Consortium 2012) and common mutations. (CCCH) CCCH zinc finger. (B) Schematic of U2AF1 interaction with the 3′ splice site of ... Since the initial reports of common U2AF1 mutations in MDS, the molecular consequences of U2AF1 mutations have been controversial. An early study found that overexpression of mutant U2AF1 in HeLa cells resulted in dysfunctional splicing marked by frequent inclusion of premature termination codons and intron retention (Yoshida et al. 2011), while another early study reported increased exon skipping in a minigene assay following mutant U2AF1 expression in 293T cells, as well as increased cryptic splice site usage in the FMR1 gene in MDS samples (Graubert et al. 2011). U2AF1 mutations have been suggested to cause both alteration/gain of function (Graubert et al. 2011) and loss of function (Yoshida et al. 2011; Makishima et al. 2012). More recently, two studies analyzed acute myeloid leukemia transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and found that exons with increased or decreased inclusion in samples with U2AF1 mutations exhibited different nucleotides prior to the AG of the 3′ splice site (Przychodzen et al. 2013; Brooks et al. 2014), suggesting that U2AF1 mutations may cause specific alterations to the RNA splicing process.  To determine how U2AF1 mutations alter RNA splicing in hematopoietic cells, we combined patient data, cell culture experiments, and biochemical studies. We found that U2AF1 mutations cause splicing alterations in biological pathways previously implicated in myeloid malignancies, including epigenetic regulation and the DNA damage response. U2AF1 mutations drive differential splicing by altering the preferred 3′ splice site motif in an allele-specific manner. Our results identify downstream targets of U2AF1 mutations that may contribute to pathogenesis, show that different U2AF1 mutations are not mechanistically equivalent, and give insight into the normal function of U2AF1’s zinc finger domains.  Go to: Results U2AF1 mutations are associated with distinct splicing programs in AML  We first tested whether U2AF1 mutations were relevant to splicing programs in leukemias with an unbiased approach. We quantified genome-wide cassette exon splicing in the transcriptomes of 169 de novo adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples that were sequenced as part of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2013) and performed unsupervised cluster analysis. Five of the seven samples carrying a U2AF1 mutation clustered together (Fig. 1C). One of the samples that fell outside of this cluster had a Q157 rather than S34 U2AF1 mutation, and the other carried a mutation in the putative RNA splicing gene KHDRBS3 in addition to a U2AF1 mutation, potentially contributing to its placement in an outgroup. Both of the outgroup U2AF1 mutant samples additionally had low mutant allele expression relative to wild-type (WT) allele expression (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that U2AF1 mutations are associated with distinct splicing patterns in patients and are consistent with a recent report that spliceosomal mutations define a subgroup of myeloid malignancies based on gene expression and DNA methylation patterns (Taskesen et al. 2014).  U2AF1 mutations alter RNA splicing in blood cells  To determine how U2AF1 mutations affect RNA splicing in an experimentally tractable system, we generated K562 erythroleukemic cell lines that stably expressed transgenic FLAG-tagged U2AF1 protein (WT, S34F, S34Y, Q157P, or Q157R mutations) at modest levels in the presence of the endogenous protein (Fig. 2A). This expression strategy, in which the transgene was modestly overexpressed at levels of 1.8–4.7× endogenous U2AF1 (Fig. 2B), is consistent with the coexpression of WT and mutant alleles at approximately equal levels that we observed in AML transcriptomes. Similar coexpression of WT and mutant alleles has been previously reported in MDS patients carrying U2AF1 mutations (Graubert et al. 2011). We separately knocked down (KD) endogenous U2AF1 to ∼13% of normal U2AF1 protein levels in the absence of transgenic expression to test whether the mutations cause gain or loss of function (Fig. 2A).  Figure 2. Figure 2. U2AF1 mutations alter splicing, but do not cause splicing failure. (A) Western blots showing levels of FLAG-tagged U2AF1 in K562 cells stably expressing the indicated alleles (top) and levels of endogenous U2AF1 in K562 cells following transfection with ... To identify mutation-dependent changes in splicing, we performed deep RNA-seq on these K562 cell lines stably expressing each mutant protein and on the control and U2AF1 KD cells (∼100M 2 × 49 bp reads per cell line). This provided sufficient read coverage to measure quantitative inclusion of ∼20,000 cassette exons that were alternatively spliced in K562 cells. Unsupervised cluster analysis of global cassette exon inclusion in these cell lines placed S34F/Y and Q157P/R as distinct groups and revealed that mutations within the first and second zinc fingers are associated with largely distinct patterns of exon inclusion (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with our cluster analysis of AML transcriptomes, in which the one sample with a Q157 mutation was placed as an outgroup to samples with S34 mutations.  We next assembled comprehensive maps of splicing changes driven by U2AF1 mutations in AML transcriptomes, K562 cells expressing mutant U2AF1, and K562 cells following U2AF1 KD. We tested ∼125,000 annotated alternative splicing events for differential splicing and assayed ∼160,000 constitutive splice junctions for evidence of novel alternative splicing or intron retention. We required a minimum change in isoform ratio of 10% to call an event differentially spliced. As our cluster analysis of K562 cells indicated that S34 and Q157 mutations generated distinct splicing patterns, we compared the six S34 AML samples to all U2AF1 WT AML samples. We separately identified splicing changes caused by both S34F and S34Y or both Q157P and Q157R in K562 cells relative to the WT control cells. The resulting catalogs of differentially spliced events revealed that all major classes of alternative splicing events, including cassette exons, competing splice sites, and retained introns, were affected by U2AF1 mutations (Fig. 2D; Supplemental Files S1–S5). Cassette exons constituted the majority of affected splicing events, followed by alternative splicing or intron retention of splice junctions annotated as constitutive in the UCSC Genome Browser (Meyer et al. 2013).  Thousands of splicing events were affected by each U2AF1 mutation, but the fraction of differentially spliced events was relatively low. For example, >400 frame-preserving cassette exons were differentially spliced in association with S34Y versus WT U2AF1 mutations; however, those >400 cassette exons constituted only ∼3.6% of frame-preserving cassette exons that are alternatively spliced in K562 cells (Fig. 2E). Expression of any mutant allele caused differential splicing of 2%–5% of frame-preserving cassette exons, with a bias toward exon skipping (Supplemental Fig. S1A). We did not observe increased levels of retained introns or isoforms that are predicted substrates for degradation by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) in association with any U2AF1 mutation. Instead, constitutive intron removal appeared slightly more efficient in cells expressing mutant versus WT U2AF1 (Fig. 2F; Supplemental Fig. S1B,C). In contrast, we did observe increased levels of predicted NMD substrates and mRNAs with unspliced introns following U2AF1 KD (Supplemental Fig. S1B,C). Consistent with these findings in K562 cells, AML samples carrying U2AF1 mutations did not exhibit increased levels of NMD substrates or intron retention (Fig. 2G; Supplemental Figs. S2–S4). We conclude that S34 and Q157 U2AF1 mutations cause splicing changes affecting hundreds of exons, but do not give rise to widespread splicing failure.  These results contrast with a previous report that the U2AF1 S34F mutation causes overproduction of mRNAs slated for degradation and genome-wide intron retention (Yoshida et al. 2011). The discrepancy between those results and our observations are likely due to differing experimental designs. This previous study acutely expressed the S34F mutation at ∼50× WT levels in HeLa cells, whereas we stably expressed each mutant protein at 1.8–4.7× WT levels in blood cells (Fig. 1D). Maintaining a balance between WT and mutant protein expression—like that observed in AML and MDS patients—may be important to maintain efficient splicing.  U2AF1 mutations cause differential splicing of cancer-relevant genes  We next sought to identify downstream targets of U2AF1 mutations that might contribute to myeloid pathogenesis. We took a conservative approach of requiring differential splicing in AML transcriptomes as well as in K562 cells to help identify disease-relevant events that are likely direct consequences of U2AF1 mutations. We intersected differentially spliced events identified in three distinct comparisons: AML S34 versus WT samples, K562 S34 versus WT expression, and K562 Q157 versus WT expression. Of AML S34-associated differential splicing, 16.8% was phenocopied in K562 S34 cells versus 4.6% for K562 Q157 cells, consistent with allele-specific effects of U2AF1 mutations (Fig. 3A). The relatively low overlap of ∼17% between AML and K562 S34-associated differential splicing is likely due to differences in gene expression patterns between K562 and AML cells, the modest nature of splicing changes caused by U2AF1 mutations (such that many changes fall near the border of our statistical thresholds for differential splicing), and our stringent restriction to events that are differentially spliced in association with both S34F and S34Y mutations in K562 cells. This analysis revealed 54 splicing events that were affected by both S34 and Q157 mutations in AML transcriptomes and K562 cells. When we instead intersected genes containing differentially spliced events—not requiring that identical exons or splice sites be affected—we found a substantially increased intersection of 140 genes (Table 1).  Figure 3. Figure 3. U2AF1 mutations affect genes involved in disease-relevant cellular processes. (A) Overlap between mutation-dependent differential splicing in AML S34F/Y patients, K562 S34F/Y cells, and K562 Q157P/R cells. Overlap taken at the level of specific events ... Table 1. Table 1. Genes that are differentially spliced in association with U2AF1 mutations Many genes that were differentially spliced in association with U2AF1 mutations participate in biological pathways previously implicated in myeloid malignancies. For example, DNMT3A encodes a de novo DNA methyltransferase and is a common mutational target in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (Ley et al. 2010; Walter et al. 2011). Multiple exons of its paralog DNMT3B, including an exon encoding part of the methyltransferase domain, are differentially spliced in AML patients carrying U2AF1 mutations as well as in K562 cells expressing U2AF1 mutant protein (Fig. 3B–D; Supplemental Fig. S5A,B). Similarly, different exons of ASXL1 are alternatively spliced in association with S34 mutations in AML transcriptomes and K562 cells, although the same exons are not consistently affected (Supplemental Files S1–S5). ASXL1 is a common mutational target in myelodysplastic syndromes and related disorders (Gelsi-Boyer et al. 2009), and U2AF1 and ASXL1 mutations co-occur more frequently than expected by chance (Thol et al. 2012). Other genes participating in epigenetic processes are differentially spliced as well, such as H2AFY (Fig. 3E; Supplemental Fig. S5C). H2AFY encodes the core histone macro-H2A.1, which is important for X chromosome inactivation (Hernández-Muñoz et al. 2005). As loss of X chromosome inactivation causes an MDS-like disease in mice (Yildirim et al. 2013), differential splicing of macro-H2A.1 could potentially be relevant to disease processes.  Isoform switches, wherein a previously minor isoform becomes the major isoform, were relatively rare but did occur. For example, a cassette exon at the 3′ end of the ATR gene, which encodes a PI3K-related kinase that activates the DNA damage checkpoint, is included at high rates in association with S34, but not Q157, mutations. This cassette exon alters the C terminus of the ATR protein, may render the mRNA susceptible to nonsense-mediated decay, and is highly conserved (Fig. 3F,G; Supplemental Fig. S5D). S34 mutations similarly cause an isoform switch from an intron-proximal to an intron-distal 3′ splice site of CASP8 that is predicted to shorten the N terminus of the protein (Fig. 3H; Supplemental Fig. S5E).  We noticed that splicing changes frequently affected multiple genes relevant to a specific biological process, such as DNA damage (ATR and FANCA) (Fig. 3G,I; Supplemental Fig. S5D,F). Consistent with this observation, Gene Ontology analysis indicated that genes involved in the cell cycle, chromatin modification, DNA methylation, DNA repair, and RNA processing pathways, among others, are enriched for differential splicing in both AML transcriptomes and K562 cells in association with U2AF1 mutations. This enrichment could be due to high basal rates of alternative splicing within these genes, which frequently are composed of many exons, or instead caused by specific targeting by mutant U2AF1. Upon correcting for gene-specific variation in the number of possible alternatively spliced isoforms, these pathways were no longer enriched in Gene Ontology analyses. We conclude that U2AF1 mutations preferentially affect specific biological pathways, but that this enrichment is due to frequent alternative splicing within such genes rather than specific targeting by U2AF1 mutant protein.  U2AF1 mutations cause allele-specific alterations in the 3′ splice site consensus  Previous biochemical studies showed that U2AF1 recognizes the core sequence motif yAG|r of the 3′ splice site (Merendino et al. 1999; Wu et al. 1999; Zorio and Blumenthal 1999). Accordingly, we hypothesized that the splicing changes caused by U2AF1 mutations might be due to preferential activation or repression of 3′ splice sites in a sequence-specific manner. To test this hypothesis, we identified consensus 3′ splice sites of cassette exons that were promoted or repressed in AML transcriptomes carrying U2AF1 mutations relative to WT patients. For each mutant U2AF1 sample, we enumerated all cassette exons that were differentially spliced between the sample and an average U2AF1 WT sample, requiring a minimum change in isoform ratio of 10%. Exons whose inclusion was increased or decreased in U2AF1 mutant samples exhibited different consensus nucleotides at the −3 and +1 positions flanking the AG of the 3′ splice site. As these positions correspond to the yAG|r motif bound by U2AF1, this data supports our hypothesis that U2AF1 mutations alter 3′ splice site recognition activity in a sequence-specific manner (Fig. 4A).  Figure 4. Figure 4. U2AF1 mutations alter 3′ splice site consensus sequences. (A) Consensus 3′ splice sites of cassette exons with increased or decreased inclusion in U2AF1 mutant relative to WT AML transcriptomes. Boxes highlight sequence preferences at ... Mutations affecting different residues of U2AF1 were associated with distinct alterations in the consensus 3′ splice site motif yAG|r of differentially spliced exons. The S34F and S34Y mutations, affecting the first zinc finger, were associated with nearly identical alterations at the −3 position in all six S34 mutant samples, whereas the Q157P mutation, affecting the second zinc finger, was associated with alterations at the +1 position (Supplemental Fig. S6). In contrast, cassette exons that were differentially spliced in randomly chosen U2AF1 WT samples relative to an average AML sample did not exhibit altered consensus sequences at the −3 or +1 positions (Supplemental Fig. S7). These results confirm the findings of two recent studies of this cohort of AML patients—which reported a frequent preference for C instead of T at the −3 position of differentially spliced cassette exons in U2AF1 mutant samples (Przychodzen et al. 2013; Brooks et al. 2014)—and extend their observations of altered splice site preference to show allele-specific effects of U2AF1 mutations, which have not been previously identified.  U2AF1 mutation-dependent sequence preferences (C/A >> T at the −3 position for S34F/Y and G >> A at the +1 position for Q157P) differ from the genomic consensus for cassette exons. C/T and G/A appear at similar frequencies at the −3 and +1 positions of 3′ splice sites of cassette exons (Supplemental Fig. S6,7), and minigene and genomic studies of competing 3′ splice sites indicate that C and T are approximately equally effective at the −3 position (Smith et al. 1993; Bradley et al. 2012). The consensus 3′ splice sites associated with promoted/repressed cassette exons in U2AF1 mutant transcriptomes also differ from U2AF1’s known RNA binding specificity. A previous study reported a core tAG|g motif in the majority of RNA sequences bound by U2AF1 in a SELEX experiment (Wu et al. 1999). Comparing that motif with preferences observed in U2AF1 mutant transcriptomes, we hypothesize that S34 U2AF1 promotes unusual recognition of C instead of T at the −3 position, while Q157 U2AF1 reinforces preferential recognition of G instead of A at the +1 position.  We next tested whether these alterations in 3′ splice site preference are a direct consequence of U2AF1 mutations. Comparing K562 cells expressing mutant versus WT U2AF1, we found that cassette exons that were promoted or repressed by each mutation exhibited sequence preferences at the −3 and +1 positions that were highly similar to those observed in AML patient samples (Fig. 4B). Mutations affecting identical residues (S34F/Y and Q157P/R) caused similar alterations in 3′ splice site preference, whereas mutations affecting different residues did not, confirming the allele-specific consequences of U2AF1 mutations. In contrast, cassette exons that were differentially spliced following KD of endogenous U2AF1 did not exhibit sequence-specific changes at the −3 or +1 positions of the 3′ splice site (Fig. 4C). We therefore conclude that S34 and Q157 mutations cause alteration or gain of function, consistent with the empirical absence of inactivating (nonsense or frameshift) U2AF1 mutations observed in patients.  U2AF1 mutations preferentially affect U2AF1-dependent 3′ splice sites  U2AF1 mutations are associated with altered 3′ splice site consensus sequences, yet only a relatively small fraction of cassette exons are affected by expression of U2AF1 mutant protein. Previous biochemical studies found that only a subset of exons have “AG-dependent” 3′ splice sites that require U2AF1 binding for proper splice site recognition (Reed 1989; Wu et al. 1999). We therefore speculated that exons that are sensitive to U2AF1 mutations might also rely upon U2AF1 recruitment for normal splicing. We empirically defined U2AF1-dependent exons as those with decreased inclusion following U2AF1 KD and computed the overlap between U2AF1-dependent exons and exons that were affected by U2AF1 mutant protein expression. For every mutation, we observed an enrichment for overlap with U2AF1-dependent exons, suggesting that U2AF1 mutations preferentially affect exons with AG-dependent splice sites (Fig. 4D).  U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3′ splice site motif yAG|r  Our genomics data shows that cassette exons promoted/repressed by U2AF1 mutations have 3′ splice sites differing from the consensus. We therefore tested whether altering the core 3′ splice site motif of an exon influenced its recognition in the presence of WT versus mutant U2AF1. We created a minigene encoding a cassette exon of ATR, which responds robustly to S34 mutations in AML transcriptomes and K562 cells (Fig. 3F,G), by cloning the genomic locus containing the ATR cassette exon and flanking constitutive introns and exons into a plasmid. The minigene exhibited mutation-dependent splicing of the cassette exon, as expected, although cassette exon recognition was less efficient than from the endogenous locus. We then mutated the −3 position of the cassette exon’s 3′ splice site to A/C/G/T and measured cassette exon inclusion in WT and S34Y K562 cells. Robust mutation-dependent increases in splicing required the A at the −3 position found in the endogenous locus, consistent with the unusual preference for A observed in our analyses of AML and K562 transcriptomes. We additionally observed a small but reproducible increase for C (Fig. 5A). We next performed similar experiments for Q157-dependent splicing changes. We created a minigene encoding a cassette exon of EPB49 (encoding the erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.9), mutated the +1 position of the 3′ splice site to A/C/G/T, and measured cassette exon inclusion in WT and Q157R K562 cells. Cassette exon recognition was suppressed by Q157R expression when the +1 position was an A, consistent with our genomic prediction, and was not affected by Q157R when the +1 position was mutated to another nucleotide. Therefore, for both ATR and EPB49, robust S34 and Q157-dependent changes in splicing required the endogenous nucleotides at the −3 and +1 positions.  Figure 5. Figure 5. U2AF1 mutations cause sequence-dependent changes in 3′ splice site recognition. (A) Schematic of ATR minigene (top) and inclusion of ATR cassette exon transcribed from minigenes with A/C/G/T at the −3 position of the 3′ splice ... We next tested how U2AF1 mutations influence constitutive, rather than alternative, splicing in an in vitro context. We used the adenovirus major late (AdML) substrate, a standard model of constitutive splicing, and mutated the −3 position of the 3′ splice site to C/T. We measured AdML splicing efficiency following in vitro transcription and incubation with nuclear extract of K562 cells expressing WT or S34Y U2AF1. The AdML substrate exhibited sequence-specific changes in splicing efficiency in association with U2AF1 mutations. Consistent with our genomic analyses, AdML with C/T at the −3 position was more/less efficiently spliced in S34Y versus WT cells (Fig. 5C). Taken together, our data demonstrate that U2AF1 mutations cause sequence-specific alterations in the preferred 3′ splice site motif in patients, in cell culture, and in vitro.  U2AF1 mutations may modify U2AF1:RNA interactions  Because U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3′ splice site motif yAG|r—the same motif that is recognized and bound by U2AF1 (Wu et al. 1999)—we next investigated whether U2AF1 mutations could potentially modify U2AF1’s RNA binding activity. U2AF1’s RNA binding specificity could originate from its U2AF homology motif (UHM) and/or its two CCCH zinc fingers. The UHM domain mediates U2AF heterodimer formation and is sufficient to promote splicing of an AG-dependent pre-mRNA substrate (Guth et al. 2001; Kielkopf et al. 2001). However, this domain binds a consensus 3′ splice site sequence with low affinity (Kielkopf et al. 2001), suggesting that it may be insufficient to generate U2AF1’s sequence specificity. Because U2AF1’s zinc fingers are independently required for U2AF RNA binding (Webb and Wise 2004), and our data indicate that zinc finger mutations alter splice site preferences, we hypothesized that U2AF1’s zinc fingers might directly interact with the 3′ splice site.  To evaluate whether this hypothesis is sterically possible, we started from the experimentally determined structure of the UHM domain in complex with a peptide from U2AF2 (Kielkopf et al. 2001), modeled the conformations of the zinc finger domains bound to RNA by aligning them to the CCCH zinc finger domains in the TIS11d:RNA complex structure (Hudson et al. 2004), and sampled the conformations of the two short linker regions using fragment assembly techniques (Leaver-Fay et al. 2011). The RNA was built in two segments taken from the TIS11d complex, one anchored in the N-terminal zinc finger and one in the C-terminal finger. We modeled multiple 3′ splice site sequences (primarily variants of uuAG|ruu) and explored a range of possible alignments of the 3′ splice site within the complex. The final register was selected on the basis of energetic analysis and manual inspection using known features of the specificity pattern of the 3′ splice site (in particular, the lack of a significant genomic consensus at the −4 and +3 positions, consistent with the experimental absence of a crosslink between U2AF1 and the −4 position) (Wu et al. 1999).  Based on these simulations, we propose a theoretical model of U2AF1 in complex with RNA wherein the zinc finger domains guide recognition of the yAG|r motif, consistent with the predictions of our mutational data. The model has the following features (Fig. 6A; Supplemental File S6). The first zinc finger contacts the bases immediately preceding the splice site, including the AG dinucleotide (Fig. 6B,C), while the second zinc finger binds immediately downstream (Fig. 6D). The RNA is kinked at the splice site and bent overall throughout the complex so that both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the motif are oriented toward the UHM domain and U2AF2 peptide. Contacts compatible with the 3′ splice site consensus are observed at the sequence-constrained RNA positions. The mutated positions S34 and Q157 are near the bases at which perturbed splice site preferences are observed for their respective mutations. Moreover, the modified preferences can, to some extent, be rationalized by contacts seen in our simulations. S34 forms a hydrogen bond with U(−1), and preference for U at −1 appears to decrease upon mutation; the Q157P mutation would improve electrostatic complementarity with G at +1 by removing a backbone NH group, in agreement with increased G preference in this mutant.  Figure 6. Figure 6. Theoretical model of the U2AF1:RNA complex. (A) Overview, with the zinc finger domains colored cyan, the RNA in salmon, the UHM beta sheet in blue, and alpha helices in red. The frequently mutated positions S34 and Q157 are shown in stick representation. ... Go to: Discussion Here, we have described the mechanistic consequences of U2AF1 mutations in hematopoietic cells and provided a catalog of splicing changes driven by each common U2AF1 mutation. U2AF1 mutations cause highly specific alterations in 3′ splice site recognition in myeloid neoplasms. Taken together with the high frequency of mutations targeting U2AF1 and genes encoding other 3′ splice site recognition factors, our results support the hypothesis that specific alterations in 3′ splice site recognition are important contributors to the molecular pathology of MDS and related hematological disorders.  We observed consistent differential splicing of multiple genes, such as DNMT3B and FANCA, that participate in molecular pathways previously implicated in blood disease. It is tempting to speculate that differential splicing of a few such genes in well-characterized pathways explain how U2AF1 mutations drive disease. However, we instead hypothesize that spliceosomal mutations contribute to dysplastic hematopoiesis and tumorigenesis by dysregulating a multitude of genes involved in many aspects of cell physiology. This hypothesis is consistent with two notable features of our data. First, hundreds of exons are differentially spliced in response to U2AF1 mutations. Second, many of the splicing changes are relatively modest. In both the AML and K562 data, we observed relatively few isoform switches, with the ATR and CASP8 examples illustrated in Figure 3 being notable exceptions. Therefore, we expect that specific targets such as DNMT3B probably contribute to, but do not wholly explain, U2AF1 mutation-induced pathophysiology. As additional data from tumor transcriptome sequencing become available—for example, as more patient transcriptomes carrying Q157 mutations are sequenced—precisely identifying disease-relevant changes in splicing will become increasingly reliable.  Our understanding of the molecular consequences of U2AF1 mutations will also benefit from further experiments conducted during the differentiation process. Both the AML and K562 data arose from relatively “static” systems, in the sense that the bulk of the assayed cells were not actively undergoing lineage specification. U2AF1 mutations likely cause similar changes in splice site recognition in both precursor and more differentiated cells, but altered splice site recognition could have additional consequences in specific cell types. A recent study reported that regulated intron retention is important for granulopoiesis (Wong et al. 2013), consistent with the idea that as-yet-unrecognized shifts in RNA processing may occur during hematopoiesis. By disrupting such global processes, altered splice site recognition could contribute to the ineffective hematopoiesis that characterizes MDS.  Relevance to future studies of spliceosomal mutations  Both mechanistic and phenotypic studies of cancer-associated somatic mutations frequently focus on single mutations, even when multiple distinct mutations affecting that gene occur at high rates. Similarly, distinct mutations affecting the same gene are frequently grouped together in prognostic and other clinical studies, thereby implicitly assuming that different mutations have similar physiological consequences. Our finding that different U2AF1 mutations are not mechanistically equivalent illustrates the value of studying all high-frequency mutations when feasible. The distinctiveness of S34 and Q157 mutation-induced alterations in 3′ splice site preference suggests that they could theoretically constitute clinically relevant disease subtypes, potentially contributing to the heterogeneity of MDS. Mutations affecting other spliceosomal genes may likewise have allele-specific consequences. For example, mutations at codons 625 versus 700 of SF3B1 are most commonly associated with uveal melanoma (Harbour et al. 2013; Martin et al. 2013) versus MDS (Graubert et al. 2011; Papaemmanuil et al. 2011; Yoshida et al. 2011; Visconte et al. 2012) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Quesada et al. 2011). Accordingly, we speculate that stratifying patients by mutation could prove fruitful for future studies of spliceosomal gene mutations.  Our study additionally illustrates how investigating disease-associated somatic mutations can give insight into the normal function of proteins. With a fairly restricted set of assumptions, we computationally predicted a family of models in which the first zinc finger of U2AF1 recognizes the AG dinucleotide of the 3′ splice site. As a computational prediction, the model must be tested with future experiments. Nonetheless, given the concordance between our theoretical model of U2AF1:RNA interactions and our mutational data, this model may provide a useful framework for future studies of U2AF1 function in both healthy and diseased cells.  Go to: Methods Vector construction and cell culture  Inserts encoding bicistronic constructs of the form U2AF1 + Gly Gly + FLAG + T2A + mCherry were created by standard methods (details in Supplemental Methods). These inserts were cloned into the self-inactivating lentiviral vector pRRLSIN.cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE (Addgene Plasmid 12252). The resulting plasmids coexpress U2AF1 and mCherry under control of the PGK promoter. K562 erythroleukemia cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. To generate stable cell lines, K562 cells were infected with concentrated lentiviral supernatants at a MOI of ∼5 in growth media supplemented with 8 μg/mL protamine sulfate. Cells were then expanded, and transduced cells expressing mCherry were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using a Becton Dickinson FACSAria II equipped with a 561-nm laser. For RNAi studies, K562 cells were transfected with a control (nontargeting) siRNA (Dharmacon D-001810-03-20) or a siRNA pool against U2AF1 (Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool L-012325-01-0005) using the Nucleofector II device from Lonza with the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V (program T16), and RNA and protein were collected 48 h after transfection.  mRNA sequencing  Total RNA was obtained by lysing 10 million K562 cells for each sample in TRIzol, and RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy columns. Using 4 μg of total RNA, we prepared poly(A)-selected, unstranded libraries for Illumina sequencing using a modified version of the TruSeq protocol (details in Supplemental Methods). RNA-seq libraries were then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 to a depth of ∼100 million 2 × 49 bp reads per sample.  Accession numbers  For the AML analysis, BAM files were downloaded from CGHub (“LAML” project) and converted to FASTQ files of unaligned reads for subsequent read mapping. For the HeLa cell analysis, FASTQ files were downloaded from DDBJ series DRA000503 (http://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/), and the reads were trimmed to 50 bp (after removing the first five bp) to restrict to the high-quality portion of the reads. A similar trimming procedure was performed in the original manuscript (Yoshida et al. 2011).  Genome annotations and read mapping  MISO v2.0 annotations were used for cassette exon, competing 5′ and 3′ splice sites, and retained intron events (Katz et al. 2010). Constitutive junctions were defined as splice junctions that were not alternatively spliced in any isoform of the UCSC knownGene track (Meyer et al. 2013). For read mapping purposes, a gene annotation file was created by combining isoforms from the MISO v2.0 (Katz et al. 2010), UCSC knownGene (Meyer et al. 2013), and Ensembl 71 (Flicek et al. 2013) annotations for the UCSC hg19 (NCBI GRCh37) human genome assembly, and a splice junction annotation file was created by enumerating all possible combinations of annotated splice sites as previously described (Hubert et al. 2013). RSEM (Li and Dewey 2011) and Bowtie (Langmead et al. 2009) were used to map reads to the gene annotation file, and TopHat (Trapnell et al. 2009) was used to align remaining unaligned reads to the genome and splice junctions (full details in Supplemental Methods).  Isoform expression measurements  MISO (Katz et al. 2010) and v2.0 of its annotations were used to quantify isoform ratios for annotated alternative splicing events, and alternative splicing of constitutive junctions and retention of constitutive introns was quantified with junction reads as previously described (Hubert et al. 2013). All analyses were restricted to splicing events with at least 20 relevant reads (reads supporting either or both isoforms) that were alternatively spliced in our data. Events were defined as differentially spliced between two samples if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) at least 20 relevant reads in both samples; (2) a change in isoform ratio of at least 10%; and (3) a Bayes factor ≥ 2.5 (AML data) or 5 (K562 data). Because the AML data had approximately twofold lower read coverage than the K562 data, we reduced the Bayes factor by a factor of two to compensate for the loss in statistical power. Wagenmakers’ framework (Wagenmakers et al. 2010) was used to compute Bayes factors for differences in isoform ratios between samples. A description of the isoform-specific PCR used for Supplemental Figure S5 is given in Supplemental Methods. To identify splicing events that were differentially spliced in AML S34 samples versus WT samples (Supplemental File S1), we used the Mann-Whitney U test and required P < 0.01. To identify splicing events that were differentially spliced in each AML sample with a U2AF1 mutation (Fig. 4A; Supplemental Fig. S6), each U2AF1 mutant sample was compared to an average U2AF1 WT sample. The average U2AF1 WT sample was created by averaging isoform ratios over all 162 U2AF1 WT samples.  Cluster analysis, sequence logos, and gene ontology enrichment  To perform the cluster analysis of AML transcriptomes (Fig. 1C) and K562 cells (Fig. 2C), we identified cassette exons that displayed changes in isoform ratios ≥ 10% across the samples and then further restricted to cassette exons with at least 100 informative reads across all samples. An informative read is defined as a RNA-seq read that supports either isoform, but not both. We created a similarity matrix using the Pearson correlation computed from the z-score normalized cassette exon inclusion values and clustered the samples using Ward’s method. Sequence logos were created with v1.26.0 of the seqLogo package in Bioconductor (Gentleman et al. 2004). Gene ontology analysis was performed with GOseq (Young et al. 2010) and is described further in Supplemental Methods.  Western blotting  Protein lysates from K562 cells pellets were generated by resuspension in RIPA buffer and protease inhibitor along with sonication. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay. Ten micrograms of protein was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody 1:1000 anti-U2AF1 (Bethyl Laboratories, catalog no. A302-080A), anti-FLAG (Thermo, catalog no. MA1-91878), anti-Histone H3 (Abcam, catalog no. ab1791), or anti-alpha-tubulin (Sigma, catalog no. T9026) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed with TBS containing 0.005% Tween 20 and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.  Minigenes  An insert containing the ATR genomic locus (Chr 3: 142168344–142172070) or EPB49 genomic locus (Chr 8: 21938036–21938724) was cloned into the EcoRV site of pUB6/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen) by Gibson assembly cloning (NEB). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate different nucleotides at the −3 position of the 3′ splice site. Details of minigene transfection and real-time PCR are specified in Supplemental Methods.  In vitro splicing  A pre-mRNA substrate transcribed from the AdML derivative HMS388 was used in all splicing reactions (Jurica et al. 2002; Reichert et al. 2002). T7 runoff transcription was used to generate G(5′)ppp(5′)G-capped radiolabeled pre-mRNA using UTP [α-32P], and K562 nuclear extracts were isolated following a published protocol (Folco et al. 2012) with a minor modification. Pre-mRNA substrates were incubated in standard splicing conditions, and RNA species were separated in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized using a phosphoimager (full details in Supplemental Methods). For quantification in Figure 5, each species was normalized by subtracting the background and then dividing by the number of uracil nucleotides in that species. The percentage of the second step products was calculated by dividing the second step species (spliced mRNA and lariat intron) by the total of all species in the lane.  Protein structure prediction  Models of U2AF1 (residues 9–174) in complex with a RNA fragment extending from the 3′ splice site positions −4 to +3 were built by combining template-based modeling, fragment assembly methods, and all-atom refinement. Models were built using the software package Rosetta (Leaver-Fay et al. 2011) with template coordinate data taken from the UHM:ULM complex structure (Kielkopf et al. 2001) (PDB ID 1jmt: residues A/46–143) and the TIS11d:RNA complex structure (Hudson et al. 2004) (PDB ID 1rgo: U2AF1 residues 16–37 mapped to A/195–216; residues 155–174 mapped to A/159–179; RNA positions −4 to −1 mapped to D/1–4; RNA positions +1 to +3 mapped to D/7–9). The remainder of the modeled region (residues 9–15, 38–45, and 144–154) was built using fragment assembly (with templated regions held internally fixed) in a low-resolution representation (backbone heavy atoms and side chain centroids) and force field. The fragment assembly simulation consisted of 6000 fragment-replacement trials, for which fragments of size 6 (trials 1–3000), 3 (trials 3001–5000), and 1 (trials 5001–6000) were used. The RNA was modeled in two pieces, one anchored in the N-terminal zinc finger and the other in the C-terminal zinc finger, with docking geometries taken from the TIS11d:RNA complex. A pseudo-energy term favoring chain closure was added to the potential function to reward closure of the chain break between the RNA fragments. The fragment assembly simulation was followed by all-atom refinement during which all side chains as well as the nontemplated protein backbone and the RNA were flexible. Roughly 100,000 independent model building simulations were conducted, each with a different random number seed and using a randomly selected member of the 1rgo NMR ensemble as a template. Low-energy final models were clustered to identify frequently sampled conformations (the model depicted in Fig. 5A was the center of the largest cluster). We explored a range of possible alignments of the splice site RNA within the complex, with the final model selected on the basis of all-atom energies, RNA chain closure, manual inspection, and known sequence features of the 3′ splice site motif. We previously identified missense mutations in the U2AF1 splicing factor affecting codons S34 (S34F and S34Y) or Q157 (Q157R and Q157P) in 11% of patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Although the role of U2AF1 as an accessory factor in the U2 snRNP is well established, it is not yet clear how mutations affect splicing or contribute to MDS pathophysiology. We analyzed splice junctions in RNA-seq data generated from transfected CD34+ hematopoietic cells and found significant differences in the abundance of known and novel junctions in samples expressing mutant U2AF1 (S34F). For selected transcripts, splicing alterations detected by RNA-seq were confirmed by analysis of primary de novo MDS patient samples. These effects were not due to impaired U2AF1 (S34F) localization as it co-localized normally with U2AF2 within nuclear speckles. We further found evidence in the RNA-seq data for decreased affinity of U2AF1 (S34F) for uridine (relative to cytidine) at the e-3 position immediately upstream of the splice acceptor site and corroborated this finding using affinity binding assays. These data suggest that the S34F mutation alters U2AF1 function in the context of specific RNA sequences, leading to aberrant alternative splicing of target genes, some of which may be relevant for MDS pathogenesis.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Recent studies have revealed that core spliceosome components are targets of recurrent mutation in a variety of hematopoietic malignancies. Splicing factor mutations, particularly in SF3B1, U2AF1 and SRSF2, are present in approximately 50% of MDS cases, making them the most common class of mutations in this disease.1-6 These mutations are also common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), occurring with a frequency of ~14%,7 and SF3B1 is the second most frequently mutated gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.8-10  U2AF1 encodes the 35 kDa auxiliary factor for the U2 pre-mRNA splicing complex and recognizes the 3’ AG dinucleotide at the splice acceptor site in a pre-mRNA intron.11, 12 U2AF1 has four domains: a U2AF homology motif (UHM), two zinc finger (ZnF) domains, and an arginine-serine (RS) domain.13 U2AF1 heterodimerizes with U2AF2 through its UHM domain,13,14 and U2AF2 in turn binds the pre-mRNA as a complex with SF1.15 This U2AF1 interaction leads to the recruitment and stabilization of U2AF binding to degenerate pre-mRNA polypyrimidine (Py) tracts.16 U2AF1 also interacts directly with serine-arginine (SR) splice factors SRSF1 and SRSF2,17 and interacts either directly or indirectly with other factors during spliceosome assembly.18  11 distinct mutations have been reported in U2AF1, including 9 missense mutations (resulting in A26V, S34F/Y, R35L, R156H/Q, Q157P/R, or G213A substitutions) and 2 frame- shift mutations (affecting codons Q157 or E159).1, 2, 6, 19-22 Most of these mutations occur within the two ZnF domains of U2AF1, with S34 and Q157 being the most commonly mutated residues. In our previous analysis in MDS, the S34F substitution was the most common (66.7%), followed by Q157P (16.7%), S34Y (11%) and Q157R (5.6%) out of 18 total U2AF1 mutations.1, 22  We previously reported that mutant U2AF1 (S34F) causes increased exon skipping and cryptic/alternative splice site utilization in minigene assays.1 In addition, other groups have observed differential splicing resulting from exon inclusion and skipping in AML patient samples with S34F (n=4) or S34Y (n=2) mutations.20 Overexpression of U2AF1 (S34F) suppresses growth and proliferation, and increases the rate of apoptosis in HeLa cells in vitro. Hematopoietic stem cells (CD34−KSL) expressing the S34F, Q157P or Q157R mutations have reduced capability to reconstitute recipient mouse bone marrow.2 Collectively, these studies provide evidence that the S34F mutation affects not only U2AF1 function but may also alter hematopoiesis.  While there have been attempts to understand the global impact of the S34F mutant on splicing and gene expression using transcriptome sequencing (i.e., RNA-seq), the genetic heterogeneity of primary MDS and AML poses challenges for discovery of target genes and no consistently dysregulated genes have been reported. It is also unclear what role the ZnF domains play and whether mutations in the S34 and Q157 residues possibly alter U2AF1 interactions with RNA or result in mis-localization.  We performed transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on CD34+ hematopoietic cells to assess the global impact of mutant U2AF1 on splicing and gene expression. We found that U2AF1 (S34F) affects pre-mRNA splicing of a large number of target genes, some of which are known oncogenic drivers, and preferentially skips splice acceptor sites immediately adjacent to uridine at the −3 position. We also determined the effect of the S34F substitution on sub-cellular localization and on the RNA binding specificity of U2AF1 for a representative affected splice site and U and C-variants at the e-3 position. Finally, we examined the effect of a spectrum of U2AF1 mutations on splicing activity.  Go to: METHODS RNA sequencing  Human hematopoietic mononuclear cells (MNCs) were separated from cord blood using density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll Paque, GE Healthcare). CD34+ cells were isolated from MNCs using the CD34 MicroBead kit (Miltenyi Biotec) on an autoMACs magnetic separator. These cells were cultured in SFEMII media (Stemcell Technologies) supplemented with IL-3, SCF, FLT-3 and TPO cytokines. WT and S34F U2AF1 cDNAs were generated, as previously described,1 and then cloned into pcDNA3.1-Ires-GFP (PIG) to create PIG-U2AF1 (WT or S34F). CD34+ cells then were transfected with PIG-U2AF1 (WT or S34F) using the Nucleofector Kit for Human CD34+ Cells (Lonza). GFP+CD34+ cells were sorted 24 hours later, followed by RNA extraction using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Ribosomal RNA was depleted (Ribozero, Epicenter), followed by cDNA preparation and Illumina library production. Sequencing was performed on the HiSeq2000 platform (Illumina). Bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data is described in the supplementary material.  RNA-seq validation  RT-PCR followed by gel electrophoresis was carried out using RNA isolated from independent CD34+ samples, transfected and purified as described above. RNA extraction and cDNA preparation from patient samples has been previously described.1 Primers used for validation can be found in Supplementary Table 5 and were designed to span the splice junction such that both the canonical and alternatively spliced isoforms are amplified. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to quantify mRNA expression was performed using Taqman 2X Universal mix on the 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Bioscience) and analyzed using the relative quantification of comparative CT method.  RNA affinities of purified U2AF1 protein complexes  Fluorescence anisotropy changes were monitored during titration of fluorescein-labeled RNAs with purified protein complexes comprising U2AF2 (residues 85-471 at the C-terminus of NCBI RefSeq NP_001012496, isoform b), SF1 (residues 1-255 of NCBI RefSeq NP_004621) with either WT U2AF1 (residues 1-193 of NCBI RefSeq NP_006749) or the S34F mutant. Proteins were full-length with the exception of the nonspecific U2AF RS domains, and for SF1, a proline-rich C-terminal domain. The protein complex purification is explained in supplementary material. The 5’-labeled fluorescein RNAs (sequences DEK-“skipped”(UAG): 5’- UAAGAAAUACUAAAUUAAUUUCUAG AAAAGAGUCUCA; DEK-“skipped”-CAG: 5’- UAAGAAAUACUAAAUUAAUUUCCAG AAAAGAGUCUCA; DEK-“spliced”(CAG) 5’- AAUUGUGAUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCAG GAAAGGGGCAGA; DEK-“spliced”-UAG: 5’- AAUUGUGAUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCAG GAAAGGGGCAGA; the three nucleotides preceding 3’ splice site junction are underlined) were synthesized and purified (ThermoScientific Dharmacon). Fluorescence anisotropy changes were measured at 520 nm following excitation at 490 nm using a Fluoromax-3 (Horiba Ltd.) equipped with microcuvette (Starna Cells Inc.). An RNA stock (0.75 mM) was diluted to 25 nM and the protein complex stocks (20 μM) were diluted to the final concentrations shown in Supplementary Figure 5B. The protein and RNA buffer composition for the binding experiments was 25 mM HEPES pH 6.8, 150 mM NaCl, 25 μM ZnCl2 and 1 mM TCEP. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants were fit, as previously described.23  Minigene constructs and transfection  To create the MIG (MND Ires GFP)-U2AF1-Flag plasmid, U2AF1-Flag cDNA was amplified from the p3X-Flag-U2AF1 plasmid (obtained from the Kinji Ohno laboratory, Nagoya, Japan) and cloned into the MND-Ires-GFP (MIG) vector.24 The S34F, S34Y, S34F/Q157R, Q157R and Q157P mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Life Technologies) using the WT MIG-U2AF1-Flag construct as a template. 293T cells were co-transfected with each MIG-U2AF1-Flag expression plasmid described above and either the GH1 or FMR1 minigene reporter constructs described previously.1, 25 GFP+ cells were sorted 48 hours later, followed by RNA extraction and RT-PCR as previously described.1 Amplicons were visualized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified by densitometry (ImageJ). Three independent experiments were performed for each assay and analyzed using the Student’s t-test. Lysates were made from transfected 293T cells and immunoblotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-U2AF1 antibody (Abcam) to confirm over-expression.  Sub-cellular localization  Constructs containing the S34F mutant allele were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of p3X-Flag-U2AF1. 293T cells were transfected with either p3X- Flag-U2AF1 (WT) or p3X-Flag-U2AF1 (S34F). 24 hours later, the cells were fixed in 2-4% formaldehyde-PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and then washed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% (wt/vol) Triton X-100/PBS for 10 minutes and blocked with 1% goat serum/0.3%TritonX-100/PBS for 1 hour. The following primary antibodies were used for fluorescence microscopy: mouse monoclonal antibodies against Smith Antigen snRNP family (Y12; Abcam) or U2AF2 (Sigma), and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-mouse (Sigma) as a secondary antibody. Monoclonal anti-Flag M2-FITC (Sigma) used to detect Flag-tagged U2AF1 and TOPRO (Life Technologies) used as a nuclear counterstain. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with a 63X, 1.4 numerical aperture, Zeiss Plan Apochromat oil objective at 2.5 zoom and captured using Zeiss LSM510 software.  Go to: RESULTS The S34F mutation affects pre-mRNA splicing  We transfected primary human CD34+ hematopoietic cells with U2AF1 (either WT or the S34F mutant) and performed RNA-seq to comprehensively determine the effects of the S34F mutant on pre-mRNA splicing and gene expression. We isolated cells 24 hours after transfection in order to identify immediate splicing changes induced by mutant U2AF1, while minimizing alterations that may occur with prolonged time in culture or as a consequence of secondary adaptations to altered splicing. Total reads of the raw sequence output ranged from 300 to 500 million per sample (Supplementary Figure 1A). Unique reads mappable to the human transcriptome were similar across all samples except for one outlier (S34F sample in replicate R3), whose replicate was excluded from further analysis (Supplementary Figure 1B). The distribution of mapped bases (coding, untranslated (UTR), intergenic, intronic and ribosomal bases) was similar for all 8 samples, with coding and UTR comprising 60-80% of the bases (Supplementary Figure 1C). As expected, reads mapped to U2AF1 exon 2 demonstrated a G>A substitution only in cells transfected with the mutant cDNA (Supplementary Figure 1D). In these samples, mutant U2AF1 represented 85- 97% of total U2AF1 expression, after normalizing for total mapped reads in each sample. Subsequent analyses capitalize on the paired experimental design (i.e., the same pool of CD34+ cells transfected with either WT or mutant U2AF1, repeated in 3 biological replicates). The ratio of total U2AF1 expression (measured by FPKM) between mutant and WT samples were consistent across pairs (5.78, 2.49, 3.66 for R1, R2, and R4, respectively).  Though unsupervised clustering using adjusted expression levels (see Supplementary Methods) of 17,390 genes segregated samples based on genotype (mutant vs WT samples; Supplementary Figure 2A), lengths of dendrogram branches connecting samples within a genotype are similar to lengths of branches connecting samples of different genotypes. This indicates that the samples do not strongly cluster by genotype and that there is no strong, acute, global, gene-level effect induced by U2AF1 (S34F). To focus on those relatively few genes that were affected by U2AF1 (S34F), we applied edgeR, a statistical approach based on total counts of reads mapped to a gene that incorporates the experiment's paired design for improved power. This revealed that 1,296 genes were differentially expressed between paired WT U2AF1 and U2AF1 (S34F) samples (FDR < 5%). Hierarchical clustering of these differentially expressed genes (supervised at the 5% FDR cutoff) segregated mutant and WT samples, as expected (Supplementary Figure 2B).  We next analyzed junction-level expression (using edgeR and total reads mapped to a junction) to assess the effect of U2AF1 (S34F) on global splicing activity. We discovered that mutant U2AF1 alters pre-mRNA splicing of expressed junctions in 6% (959/15,687, FDR<5%) of genes (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 3A-B and Supplementary Table 2). Of the 959 genes alternatively spliced junctions, 241 (FDR<5%) were also differentially expressed at the gene level in S34F samples compared to WT (Supplementary Figure 3B and Supplementary Table 2). These expression differences involved known splice junctions (present in Ensembl, release 67), and novel junctions resulting from: 1) known splice acceptor and donor sites (novel junction involving a donor and acceptor that are individually present in Ensembl transcripts, but which have not been observed in combination), 2) known splice acceptor and novel (not present in Ensembl) splice donor sites, 3) novel splice acceptor and known splice donor sites, or 4) novel splice acceptor and donor sites (Supplementary Figure 3A). Both the known and novel junctions reflected an increase or decrease in mRNA isoforms due to alternative splicing, including exon skipping, alternative 3’ or 5’ splice site usage, and events that involved usage of both the alternative 5’ and 3’ splice sites (Supplementary Figure 3C; Supplementary Table 2). Next, we identified altered junctions differing by at least 4-fold in mutant vs. WT expressing samples. We discovered significant differences in the abundance of 544 out 202,401 total junctions (FDR<5%, | log2(fold change) | > 2) in cells expressing U2AF1 (S34F), compared with WT [known splice junctions (280/170,321; 0.16%); novel splice junctions (264/31,180; 0.85%)] (Figure 1A-D; Supplementary Table 2). Reads from novel junctions resulting from both novel acceptor and donor sites were not analyzed further.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Overexpression of U2AF1 (S34F) alters the distribution of known and novel splice junctions We selected 24 junctions with higher expression (FDR<5%; | log2(fold change) | >2) in U2AF1 (S34F) samples for validation in independently prepared CD34+ cells. Of these, we validated 10/20 known junctions (Figure 2A-B and Supplementary Figure 4A-C, left panels) and 4/4 novel junctions (Supplementary Figure 4D). 10 of the validated changes were further tested in primary clinical samples [n=6 MDS bone marrow samples with U2AF1 (S34F) vs. n=6 MDS controls with no U2AF1 splicing mutations] and 5 were confirmed, including junctions resulting from alternative splicing due to exon skipping in DEK and SMN1 and 3’ alternative site usage in SERPIN8B, KIAA1033, and IFI44 (Figure 2A-B and Supplementary Figure 4A-B, right panels). As further independent validation of the 544 junctions, we assessed their differential expression between 6 S34(F/Y) U2AF1 mutant AML patient samples and 108 control AML samples in publically-available TCGA RNA-seq data.26 Other than the S34 variants in the 6 mutant samples, none of the samples had nucleotide mutations or copy number alternations in U2AF1 or any of 272 other splicing factors. 10 junctions had statistically significant (FDR < 5%) dysregulation with concordant fold change, i.e., in the same direction as detected in CD34+ cells (p-value < 10−3; Supplementary Table 3).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Exon skipping and alternative splice site usage increased in U2AF1 (S34F) mutant samples It has been shown previously that U2AF1 is not required for splicing of introns containing strong Py tracts,27 but it is important for splicing of introns that contain short or weak Py tracts.11, 28, 29 To determine whether there were sequence differences in the 3’ splice sites of junctions affected by U2AF1 (S34F), we analyzed sequences flanking (from −20 to +3 bps) the 3’ AG dinucleotide (the binding site for U2AF1). We focused on exon skipping and alternative 3’ site usage events, as these represent the majority of dysregulated events (Supplementary Figure 3C). An exon-skipping event was defined as skipping of a single cassette exon (Figure 3A). An alternative 3’ usage event resulted in partial loss of an exon due to skipping of the canonical junction and usage of a single alternative 3’ splice site down-stream of the canonical 3’ splice site (Figure 3B). When we analyzed the 3’ splice sites of skipped exons, we found that there was a high frequency of uridine (U) at position e-3 in exons that were skipped more by U2AF1 (S34F) compared to those skipped more in WT [S34F>WT: 81/111 (73%); WT>S34F: 10/68 (15%); p=8.5x10−15] (Figure 3A), consistent with previously reported findings.20, 30 The 3’ canonical junctions skipped more by U2AF1 (S34F) also had a higher frequency of U at position e-3 [S34F>WT: 64/101 (63%); WT>S34F: 22/101 (22%); p=3.7x10−9] (Figure 3B, left panel), and resulted in increased 3’ alternative cryptic splice site usage, consistent with a recent report.30 We then analyzed the 3’ alternative cryptic splice site to determine whether there was a sequence preference for the S34F mutant. As seen with skipped exons, there was a higher frequency of uridine (U) at the e-3 position of the skipped junctions expressed more in U2AF1 (S34F) compared to WT [71/101 (70%); WT>S34F: 38/101 (38%); p=5.2x10−6] (Figure 3B, right panel). No other apparent differences in base preferences were noted in the Py tract preceding the 3’ AG dinucleotide of the skipped exons or junctions. As a control, we analyzed junctions that showed no evidence for differential expression by U2AF1 (S34F) [ | log2(fold change) | < 0.001] (Figure 3C). We did not observe any differences in sequences at the 5’ splice site of skipped exons, or at 5’ sites of exons with alternative 5’ or 3’ splice sites (Supplementary Figure 3D and data not shown), consistent with the known activity of U2AF1 which is restricted to 3’ splice sites. Collectively, these data suggest that the 3’ splice sites that are more frequently skipped by U2AF1 (S34F) are enriched for U at e-3, while alternative sites utilized more frequently by the mutant are enriched for C at e-3. We examined junctions that were validated in patient samples and found that all validated junctions (5/5) had U at position e-3 at skipped junctions, suggesting that this consensus sequence enriches for true positive junctions that are preferentially skipped by U2AF1 (S34F) (Supplementary Table 4).  Figure 3 Figure 3 The U2AF1 (S34F) mutant recognizes the uridine at position e-3 of the 3’ splice site less frequently The S34F mutation alters the affinity of pre-mRNA to U2AF1  The enhanced exon skipping and alternative 3’ splice site usage seen with the U2AF1 (S34F) mutant could be due to altered binding of U2AF1 to canonical 3’ AG (acceptor site). To explore this further, we compared the RNA affinities of WT and S34F-mutant U2AF1 for splice sites from a representative affected transcript, the DEK oncogene, where a U at position e-3 (i.e., UAG) was skipped in favor of splicing into a CAG splice site. The DEK1-“skipped” RNA oligo comprised the intron/exon region of the splice acceptor site of exon 3 (skipped by S34F mutant U2AF1) whereas the DEK- “spliced” RNA oligo comprised the downstream intron/exon 4 sequence that is preferentially spliced into by the mutant (Figure 4A). To better emulate the context of the assembling spliceosome, we used ternary complexes of either wild-type U2AF1 (residues 1-193) or the S34F mutant with accessory protein subunits for the early stage of 3’ splice site recognition: U2AF2 (residues 85-471 at the C-terminus) and SF1 (residues 1-255) (Figure 4B, Supplementary Figure 5A). Both of the U2AF proteins were full length with the exception of the nonspecific RS domains. For SF1, a C-terminal proline-rich domain thought to interact with 5’ splice site subunits was truncated. The RNA oligos were fluorescein-labeled and the RNA affinities were determined from anisotropy changes during titration with the purified protein complexes (Supplementary Figure 5B). Consistent with S34F-dependent skipping of the corresponding DEK splice site, the DEK-“skipped” RNA oligo bound less avidly to mutant U2AF1 (S34F) compared with WT (Figure 4C). The nearly identical binding of mutant or WT U2AF1 to the DEK-“spliced” RNA oligo also was consistent with the similar splicing of the downstream splice site in normal and mutant U2AF1 samples.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Comparison of the WT and S34F U2AF1 affinities for splice sites from a representative affected transcript, the DEK oncogene Based on the preferential, S34F-dependent skipping of junctions with U at position e-3 and splicing of junctions with C at position e-3 in the presence of mutant U2AF1 (S34F), we next tested the RNA sequence discrimination of the WT and S34F mutant protein complexes for the C or U e-3 variants of the DEK splice sites (Figure 4A). Alteration of the UAG in the skipped DEK sequence to CAG (DEK-“skipped”-CAG, Figure 4A) increased the affinity for both the U2AF1 protein complexes and to a significantly greater extent for the S34F-mutant (2-fold and 9-fold higher affinity for the WT and S34F proteins, respectively) (Figure 4C). Conversely, alteration of the CAG in the downstream, spliced DEK sequence to UAG (DEK-“spliced”-UAG, Figure 4A) decreased the affinity for both the U2AF1 protein complexes with a significantly greater penalty for the S34F mutant (factors of 2 and 6 affinity decrease for the WT and S34F proteins, respectively) (Figure 4C). These data demonstrate that the S34F mutation alters the sequence specificity of the ternary U2AF1 complex in favor of binding splice sites comprising C at e-3 and discriminates against splice sites comprising U at the e-3 position.  The S34F mutation does not affect U2AF1 localization within nuclear speckles  U2AF1 is diffusely distributed in the nucleoplasm and localizes within the nuclear speckles (sites of spliceosome assembly).31, 32 Using fluorescence immunocytochemistry on U2AF1-Flag (WT or S34F) transfected 293T cells, we found that U2AF1 (S34F) localized normally (Supplementary Figure 6A). Furthermore, U2AF1 (S34F) co-localized with U2AF2 and Smith Antigen family of snRNP proteins (Y12 antibody) in a similar pattern as WT (Supplementary Figure 6B), suggesting that the altered splicing activity of U2AF1 (S34F) was not due to abnormal trafficking of the mutant protein.  Specific effects of U2AF1 mutations in alternative splicing  Apart from the S34F substitution, there are 10 other reported somatic mutations in U2AF1 that may affect its function. Since mutations at codons S34 and Q157 are the most common, we utilized GH1 and FMR1 minigenes1, 25 to determine the effect of substitutions at these positions on splicing activity. The GH1 or FMR1 minigene was transiently co-transfected with either MND-IRES-GFP (MIG; empty vector) or MIG-U2AF1-Flag (WT, S34F, S34Y, S34F/Q157R, Q157R or Q157P alleles) into 293T cells. Over-expression was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure 5A; Supplementary Figure 7A) and Western blot analysis (Figure 5B; Supplementary Figure 7B). Isoform a represents the canonical isoform, and isoforms b and c (if present) are the alternatively spliced isoforms. In GH1, isoform b results from exon skipping and in FMR1 isoforms b and c result from alternative 3’ splice site usage. U2AF1 (S34F) yielded the most significant increase in alternative splicing activity for both GH1 and FMR1 (Figure 5C and D, respectively), consistent with previously published results.1 U2AF1 (S34Y) modestly enhanced relative expression of the alternative isoforms for both minigenes. Conversely, there was a reduction in relative expression of the alternative isoforms for both minigenes in cells expressing the Q157R (Figure 5C and D) and Q157P mutations (Supplementary Figure 7C and D). In cells expressing the S34F/Q157R double mutant (in which both the mutant S34F and Q157R occur on one allele, discovered in one patient with MDS1), GH1 splicing was indistinguishable from WT (Figure 5C) and there was a modest reduction in the relative expression of the alternative isoform of FMR1 (Figure 5D). Next, we examined the effects of different U2AF1 mutations on the splicing of endogenous DEK. Exon skipping in endogenous DEK was increased in 293T samples expressing S34F/Y, S34F/Q157R and Q157R mutants relative to WT (Figure 5E). As observed with the GH1 and FMR1 minigenes, the S34F mutant caused the most robust increase in alternative isoform b expression. However, unlike the GH1 and FMR1 minigenes, expression of the Q157R mutant resulted in increased alternative isoform splicing compared to WT expressing cells for DEK. Interestingly, analysis of TCGA AML RNA-seq data demonstrated that junctions differentially expressed in a sample with Q157P mutant U2AF1 vs. WT U2AF1 (| log2(fold change) | >1) do not share the signature at flanking sequences (C>U at e-3) that we detected in junctions differentially spliced by S34F U2AF1 (FDR <5%; Supplementary Figure 8). These results provide evidence that splicing is altered in a mutation-specific manner, but variable between specific junctions tested, with the most potent effects caused by U2AF1 (S34F) mutant.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Recurrent missense mutations in U2AF1 have specific effects on alternative splicing Go to: DISCUSSION Recent discoveries of recurrent mutations in core components of the pre-mRNA splicing complex highlight the potential importance of these genes in myelodysplastic syndromes. In this study, we used RNA-seq to detect global changes in splicing activity and isoform expression and discovered differences in expression of known and novel splice junctions. Our study is the first to analyze the impact of a mutant splicing factor on the transcriptome in a controlled genetic background in primary hematopoietic cells. So a consistent signature has not been defined for genes whose splicing is clearly affected by U2AF1 (S34F). Published results are conflicting, with one study reporting ~130 unspliced exons due to intron retention in mutant U2AF1-transfected HeLa cells2 while another (utilizing patient samples with a spectrum of splicing mutations) found no evidence for genome-wide intron retention, although these mutations did perturb TET2 splicing.6 Analysis of TCGA AML RNA-seq data revealed a predominance of exon skipping in 35 exons dysregulated by U2AF1 (S34F).20 The affected genes were involved in mitosis and RNA processing. Our results include a substantially larger number of alternative splicing events that were impacted by U2AF1 (S34F). Of the 35 genes that had significant exon skipping or retention in the data set from Pryzchodzen, et al.,20 only one gene (STRAP) overlaps with our results. When we validated the 544 junctions that were differential expressed in our RNA-seq data with the TCGA RNA-seq data, we found 10 genes that overlapped with our results, including STRAP and CCT6A. Although the DEK junction was not among these, the same DEK junction did have a p-value of 0.06 and concordant fold change in the TCGA data. Several characteristics of our experimental design may explain these largely non-overlapping results, including: (1) the use of CD34+ cells which have less genetic heterogeneity, compared to primary patient samples, (2) use of paired samples (S34F vs. WT), minimizing variability within biological replicates, and (3) differences in analytical approaches.  We found a higher frequency of uridine at the e-3 nucleotide in 3’ splice junctions that were skipped more often in U2AF1 (S34F) samples, including both exon skipping events and alternative 3’ splice site usage. These findings confirm previous observations related to exon skipping and alternative splice site usage.20, 30 This implies that there is selective or altered U2AF1 (S34F) binding to pre-mRNA at these junctions, possibly resulting from an increased affinity of U2AF1 (S34F) for C over U, relative to WT U2AF1, which we corroborated experimentally by determining the affinities of purified U2AF2/U2AF1 (WT or S34F) heterodimers for the affected splice sites of a representative example, DEK. Consistent with the S34F-affected splice site junctions, the S34F mutation selectively inhibited binding of the mutant U2AF1 complexes to the DEK splice site variants comprising U at the e-3 position. Conversely, substitution with a C at this position significantly increased U2AF1 (S34F) binding.  While it is not known which U2AF1 domain or domains directly bind RNA, the altered RNA binding affinity of the S34F mutant U2AF1 suggests that the ZnF domains are critical. The S34F mutation is in the first of these domains. In S. pombe, substitution of highly conserved cysteine residues (C18 and C149) to alanine of the ZnF domains results in lethality, and an RNA three-hybrid screen showed that these two ZnF domains are independently required for RNA binding of the U2AF heterodimer in yeast.33 Furthermore, the U2AF1 ZnF domains are predicted to be structurally similar to the murine and human ZFP36 family (both CX8CX5CX3H zinc fingers), which are known to bind RNA,34, 35 and our data suggest that the ZnF1 domain of U2AF1 may have this function. Rather than simply ablating function, the capacity of the S34F mutation to specifically discriminate between U and C at the e-3 position of the splice site junction implicates this residue in hydrogen bonds with the N3 or O4 positions of the pyrimidine base.  While mutant U2AF1 alters pre-mRNA splicing, the overall change in the total number of known and novel junctions is minimal, affecting (at an FDR <5%) fewer than 1% (1,594/201,501) of expressed junctions in 6% of analyzed genes. In addition, the proportion of isoforms induced by U2AF1 (S34F) expression is a small fraction of the total transcript for those genes. Collectively, these findings raise the possibility that disease pathogenesis induced by mutant U2AF1 may also be mediated through non-pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms that should be explored in future studies.  Finally, we discovered that the S34 and Q157 U2AF1 mutations have different effects on pre-mRNA splicing using GH1 and FMR1 minigenes. We detected an increase in relative expression of the alternative isoforms for both minigenes with S34 mutants, and a decrease in relative expression of these isoforms with Q157 mutants relative to WT, indicating that these mutations affect U2AF1-dependent splicing function differently depending on their location and the reporter junctions being queried (S34; ZnF1 and Q157; ZnF2). In fact, when splicing of endogenous DEK was analyzed following expression of U2AF1 (Q157R), a similar but less robust increase in alternative splicing was observed as seen with expression of U2AF1 (S34F). Junction analysis of one Q157P sample in the TCGA AML RNA-seq data adds credence to these findings. The differentially expressed junctions in this Q157P sample did not share the same signature at flanking sequences that were detected in junctions differentially spliced by S34F U2AF1 (C>U at e-3). These results suggest that there are differences in alternative splicing induced by S34F vs. Q157R/P mutations, but highlight the need for an unbiased transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) comparing expression of U2AF1 S34F vs. Q157R/P in order to elucidate the full extent of these similarities and differences. The splicing alterations detected with specific U2AF1 mutants may be shared by other splicing factors with recurrent mutations in myeloid neoplasms such as SF3B1, ZRSR2, SRSF2 and SF1 and common changes could serve as novel therapeutic targets across these diseases. Identifying important potential target genes that are affected by U2AF1 mutants is necessary for further understanding of their role in MDS and other cancers.  
1153|| Abstract Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematopoietic stem cell disorders that often progress to chemotherapy-resistant secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). We used whole genome sequencing to perform an unbiased comprehensive screen to discover all the somatic mutations in a sAML sample and genotyped these loci in the matched MDS sample. Here we show that a missense mutation affecting the serine at codon 34 (S34) in U2AF1 was recurrently mutated in 13/150 (8.7%) de novo MDS patients, with suggestive evidence of an associated increased risk of progression to sAML. U2AF1 is a U2 auxiliary factor protein that recognizes the AG splice acceptor dinucleotide at the 3′ end of introns and mutations are located in highly conserved zinc fingers in U2AF11,2. Mutant U2AF1 promotes enhanced splicing and exon skipping in reporter assays in vitro. This novel, recurrent mutation in U2AF1 implicates altered pre-mRNA splicing as a potential mechanism for MDS pathogenesis.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogenous group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by dysplastic blood cell formation and peripheral blood cytopenias. Up to 30% of patients with MDS will progress to highly chemotherapy-resistant secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers an unbiased approach to discover all the genetic mutations present in cancer genomes and has been used to identify novel mutations in de novo and therapy-related AML genomes3–7. Here we report the results of WGS of an MDS-derived sAML sample and the matched normal (skin) sample. We performed WGS using 100 base pair paired-end reads and obtained 39.1x and 38.2x haploid and 99.3% and 98.9% diploid coverage of the sAML and normal samples, respectively (see Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 1). We divided the genome into non-overlapping tiers, as previously described4, and validated putative mutations using deep sequencing of captured DNA isolated from the sAML, normal, and MDS samples. We validated 507 somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the sAML sample, including 30 SNVs in protein coding regions (tier 1 mutations). 505/507 SNVs preexisted in the MDS sample, including 30 tier 1 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Tables 2, 3). The same codon in U2AF1 (U2AF35) was mutated in 2 additional MDS-derived sAML cases analyzed by whole genome sequencing (data not shown). This was the sole recurrent mutation in these cases. To determine the frequency of this mutation in MDS, we sequenced the entire coding region of U2AF1, including 9 exons, in diagnostic bone marrow and paired normal (skin) samples from 150 consecutively accrued de novo MDS patients (including the index case) and identified 13 patients (8.7%) with missense mutations affecting the highly conserved serine at amino acid position 34 (S34) in U2AF1 (Fig. 1a). The same nucleotide was mutated in all samples, resulting in either a S34F (n=11) or S34Y (n=2) substitution (Supplementary Table 4). One patient with an S34F mutation (UPN 947519) also had a U2AF1 Q157R mutation located in the second zinc finger (Fig. 1a). Sequencing of the U2AF1 cDNA from this patient revealed that both mutations occur on the same allele. No other somatic SNVs affecting U2AF1 were detected in these samples. Subsequent analysis focused on the highly recurrent S34 mutations.  Figure 1 Figure 1 U2AF1 mutations found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) U2AF1 is the small (35 kDa) subunit of U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) that is involved in pre-mRNA processing (splicing), and it forms a heterodimer with the larger subunit U2AF2 (U2AF65)2. U2AF1 binds the 3′ AG splice acceptor dinucleotide of the pre-mRNA target intron2 and U2AF2 binds the adjacent polypyrimidine tract. PCR amplicons spanning the S34 codon were generated using genomic DNA and cDNA templates from unpurified MDS bone marrow cells from 11 patients with confirmed U2AF1 mutations, and subjected to deep sequencing to obtain mutant allele frequencies. Importantly, there was no deletion or uniparental isodisomy (UPD) that spanned the U2AF1 locus (chromosome 21q22.3) based on SNP arrays and whole genome sequencing data for the index case. Read counts from the genomic DNA samples (including the sAML sample from the index case and serial MDS samples from two other patients) showed that the S34 mutant allele frequencies were ~40–50%, indicating that the majority of cells in the samples contained a heterozygous mutation, even though the myeloblast counts ranged from 0–21% in the MDS samples (Fig. 1b). Similar results were obtained from cDNA deep sequencing (~30–50% mutant allele frequency), indicating that both the S34 mutant and wild-type alleles were expressed in all samples tested, regardless of the myeloblast count (Fig. 1c). In addition, there was no difference in the total levels of U2AF1 mRNA or the dominant U2AF1 isoform that was expressed in unfractionated MDS bone marrow samples from patients with and without U2AF1 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Collectively, these results suggest that U2AF1 mutations are an early, initiating genetic event in MDS pathogenesis.  Although eight of the mutant samples had myeloblast counts > 5%, patients with U2AF1 mutations were not restricted to a particular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) category and had a median IPSS score of 1 (range 0–3) (Supplementary Table 5). Patients with a del(20q) or −20 karyotype were more likely to harbor a U2AF1 mutation (P=0.03), although the number of patients with mutations and del(20q) or −20 is small (n=4) (Table 1). No difference in event-free or overall survival was observed in patients with or without U2AF1 mutations (Fig. 2a–b). However, the 2 mutant patients with the longest overall survival had received hematopoietic stem cell transplants (Supplementary Fig. 1). Patients with U2AF1 mutations had an increased probability of progression to sAML (P=0.03) (Fig. 2c), an observation that will require confirmation in a larger cohort. This corresponds to a U2AF1 mutation frequency of 15.2% (7/46 patients) in the subset of MDS patients that progress to sAML vs. 5.8% (6/104 patients) in the subset that did not. Since there was no statistical difference in the myeloblast count or IPSS distribution of patients with or without U2AF1 mutations (Table 1), the mutant genotype does not appear to be a surrogate for these well-established predictors of sAML risk.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Impact of U2AF1 mutations on clinical outcome Table 1 Table 1 Patient Characteristics Splicing involves cleavage of intronic sequences from pre-mRNA, followed by ligation of the remaining exons together to produce a mature mRNA product8. Inclusion and exclusion of different exons or utilization of alternative 3′ splice sites during pre-mRNA processing produces multiple protein isoforms that can have different functions within a cell, and alternative splicing can be affected by the levels of U2AF1 in a cell9–12. It is unknown which domain of U2AF1 binds the pre-mRNA. Interestingly, the S34 and Q157 residues are located within zinc finger domains (Fig. 1a) that may be important for RNA binding activity. Indeed, the U2AF1 zinc fingers are structurally similar to the murine and human ZFP36 family zinc fingers (both CX8CX5CX3H zinc fingers)13–15 that bind RNA and the noncanonical RNA recognition motif (RRM; also known as U2AF homology motif, UHM) in U2AF1 only weakly binds RNA16.  To examine the effects of the S34F mutation on U2AF1 splicing activity, we utilized previously described and validated in vitro double-reporter splicing and minigene reporter assays9,17. The double-reporter plasmid constitutively expresses β-galactosidase, while luciferase is expressed only if appropriate splicing removes an upstream intron that contains translational stop codons. Transient co-expression of the double-reporter plasmid pTN24 and the S34F mutant U2AF1 cDNA in 293T cells resulted in a significant increase in splicing (as detected by an increase in the luciferase/β-galactosidase ratio), compared to co-expression of wild-type U2AF1, despite similar total U2AF1 protein levels in all samples (Fig. 3a, P<0.001). The level of splicing was similar in cells depleted of endogenous U2AF1 compared to control cells (Fig. 3b, left column), and the increase in splicing observed with the S34F mutant U2AF1 is independent of endogenous U2AF1 levels (Fig. 3b, right column, P<0.001 when compared to vector alone). This suggests that splicing activity in this assay is insensitive to U2AF1 levels, and increased splicing mediated by the mutant protein is attributable to a novel gain-of-function activity.  Figure 3 Figure 3 U2AF1 S34F mutation induces splicing alterations Next, we examined exon skipping using a minigene reporter plasmid (a human gene fragment containing an upstream and downstream exon surrounding an intron-flanked exon). Appropriate splicing produces an mRNA with all 3 exons, while exon skipping fuses the upstream and downstream exons only. We measured the levels of exon skipping using a GH1 minigene reporter plasmid in cells transiently co-transfected with either wild-type or S34F mutant U2AF1 cDNA. The proportion of transcripts with a skipped exon (lower PCR band) relative to the appropriately spliced GH1 minigene (upper PCR band) is increased in cells expressing the S34F U2AF1 mutant compared to control or wild-type U2AF1 expression (Fig. 3c, P=0.01). This increase in exon skipping mediated by mutant U2AF1 remained significant after depletion of endogenous U2AF1 in 293T cells (Fig. 3c, P<0.02). We also observed an increased utilization of alternative 3′ cryptic splice sites in the FMR1 gene in clinical MDS samples with U2AF1 mutations compared to MDS samples without U2AF1 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The alternative splicing of FMR1 was confirmed to be mutant U2AF1-dependent using a FMR1 minigene splicing reporter assay in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 3b).  Collectively, these results suggest that U2AF1 S34 mutations may result in subtle increases in splicing efficiency (Fig. 3a) -- or possibly altered isoform expression (Fig. 3c) --which could induce gene expression changes. To test whether U2AF1 mutations alter global gene expression levels, we analyzed mRNA microarray data (Affymetrix U133plus2) obtained from bone marrow CD34+ cells purified from 6 MDS patients with a U2AF1 mutation, 9 MDS patients without a mutation, and 4 normal donors18. The U2AF1 mutant samples did not segregate together using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm with all 19 samples, however, the 6 U2AF1 mutant samples did segregate together when compared to the normal control samples (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Next, we identified the genes that were significantly different between control and mutant patients using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM)19. SAM identified 401 dysregulated probesets (50 up-regulated and 351 down-regulated) in U2AF1 mutant versus control samples (FDR<0.005) (Supplementary Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table 6). Three of the most enriched functional annotation categories for genes that are down-regulated in U2AF1 mutant samples are splicing and RNA recognition motif (RRM) genes (enrichment scores 2.5–4.3) (Supplementary Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 6). These results suggest that a compensatory down-regulation of splicing genes may exist in U2AF1 mutant samples. These gene categories were not down-regulated in U2AF1 wild-type MDS patients compared to controls (data not shown), suggesting that down-regulation of splicing and RRM genes is not common to all MDS samples, but instead is associated with U2AF1 mutations.  Mutations in U2AF1 represent a novel mechanism that could alter gene expression in MDS and expand the list of commonly mutated genes in MDS that may affect transcription or translation, including RPS14, TET2, EZH2, ASXL1, and DNMT3A20–26. Only two patients in our cohort of 150 de novo MDS samples had both a DNMT3A and U2AF1 mutation (Supplementary Table 7). Both of these mutations appear to be early genetic events in MDS, given their high mutant allele burdens in patients with early stage disease26.  U2AF1 is highly conserved (Fig. 1a)1, and homozygous loss is lethal in many organisms27–29. We did not observe any nonsense, frameshift or missense mutations affecting the coordinating CCCH residues in the zinc fingers, again suggesting the S34 mutations are not loss-of-function mutations. The corresponding amino acid in the human ZFP36L2 (a ZFP36 family member) protein interacts with RNA through a hydrogen bond, further suggesting that the S34 position may be important for RNA binding13. Additionally, interactions between conserved aromatic amino acids in ZFP36 family members and RNA bases stabilize the protein RNA complexes formed13. The two amino acid substitutions we identified at S34 add a bulky aromatic ring (phenylalanine or tyrosine) to the zinc finger, which may alter, or even enhance, binding of the zinc finger to RNA. We suggest that the S34F/Y mutations in U2AF1 alter the specificity of U2AF1-dependent splicing. Pre-mRNAs with strong polypyrimidine tracts can splice independently of U2AF1 in vitro, whereas weak polypyrimidine tracts are more dependent on U2AF1 for appropriate splicing2,11. Therefore, the pattern of U2AF specificity (determined by both U2AF1 and U2AF2) may be influenced by the nucleotide sequence in pre-mRNAs and may be an important factor in determining which genes are altered in cells expressing mutant U2AF1.  Alternative splicing has been described for a wide range of cancers30,31, although the underlying mechanisms that influence cancer pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Alterations in the transcriptome mediated by alternative splicing may contribute directly to cancer, or indirectly by engaging some other pathway. The identification of somatic mutations in spliceosome genes in MDS by our group and others32–34, raises the possibility that mutations in splicing factors, including U2AF1, may be responsible for the observed alterations of splicing in cancer. Ultimately, cancer cells may generate genetic diversity in a large number of genes by selecting cells with mutations in U2AF1 or other spliceosome proteins. Identification of key target genes affected by U2AF1 mutations will be critical for our understanding of how these mutations contribute to MDS pathogenesis.

The blast population (low SSC/CD45 dim) was sorted using a Reflection high speed cell sorter (Sony iCyt) directly into lysis buffer and genomic DNA was prepared by column purification (Qiagen DNeasy).  Whole genome sequence production  Four DNA libraries were generated for paired-end sequencing: two from the tumor sample (flow-sorted sAML myeloblasts), and two from the normal sample (punch biopsy of unaffected skin). Sequence data was generated using both Illumina GAIIx and Illumina Hiseq platforms in 2 × 100 paired-end reads. Reads were aligned individually to NCBI Build 36 of the human reference sequence using BWA 0.5.5 and SAMtools r544. Alignments were merged into a single BAM file and marked for duplicates using Picard 1.17 (http://picard.sourceforge.net). Only non-duplicate reads were used for all downstream analyses.  Somatic mutation detection  Candidate point mutations were predicted using SomaticSniper (D. Larson et al, in press), previously referred to as glfSomatic4,35. Putative single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with somatic score of 40 and average mapping quality of 40 were considered high-confidence (HC); all others were deemed low-confidence (LC). Small (<100 bp) insertion/deletion events (indels) were called using a combination of GATK36, IndelGenotyper, Pindel37, and a modified version of SAMtools38. Both SNVs and indels were annotated using gene structure and conservation information, and classified by tier as previously described4. Briefly, tier 1 contains all changes in the amino acid coding regions of annotated exons, consensus splice-site regions, and RNA genes (including microRNA genes). Tier 2 contains changes in highly conserved regions of the genome or regions that have regulatory potential. Tier 3 contains mutations in the nonrepetitive part of the genome that do not meet tier 2 criteria, and tier 4 contains mutations in the remainder of the genome. High confidence tier 2 and tier 3 mutations, and all tier 1 mutations (regardless of confidence) were selected for validation (see below).  To identify somatic DNA copy number changes from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, reads aligned by BWA39 were binned into contiguous, non-overlapping 1 kb windows. Copy number for each bin was normalized to the median copy number for each chromosome in tumor and normal separately. A Hidden Markov Model algorithm40 was used to generate a list of segments with copy number expressed as log2 (tumor/normal). Copy number changes were also supported if loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was observed in the affected regions. In brief, heterozygous SNPs were identified in WGS data from the normal sample (>10 reads of >q10 quality with non-reference allele frequencies of 0.4–0.6). The variant allele frequencies at these positions were then averaged in bins of 20 consecutive SNPs and visualized for the normal and tumor samples separately. Deletions, amplifications, inter-, and intrachromsomal rearrangements were also predicted using the BreakDancer algorithm41.  Mutation validation  To comprehensively evaluate tier 1–3 predictions, we utilized a custom solid-phase capture platform. We selected all tier 1 SNV predictions (HC and LC) and all HC tier 2–3 SNVs. Tier 1–3 indel predictions were also included. In addition, we used this approach to validate SV predictions (deletions and rearrangements). We identified 8–16 SNPs that were heterozygous in the normal DNA sample (determined using the WGS and SNPa data) that were located within the affected segments and 8 SNPs from flanking normal regions. The genomic positions of SNVs and indels (with a 200 bp margin) and SVs (with a 400 bp margin) were submitted for probe design. Probes were synthesized on custom HD2.1 long oligonucleotide arrays (Roche NimbleGen). Whole genome amplified DNA (REPLI-g, Qiagen) from the normal (skin), unfractionated MDS, and unfractionated sAML samples was used as bait for capture on the arrays and the recovered DNA (enriched for target sequences) was resequenced on the Illumina GAIIx platform.  At least 10x coverage was obtained for ~87.16% of the target sequence for all samples (see Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 1). Reads were mapped using BWA39, deduplicated, and merged into BAM files. The reference or somatic status at the nucleotide of interest was then determined for each sample using VarScan242 with the following parameters: min-coverage=10, min-var-freq=0.05, somatic-p-value<0.01, validation=1. To validate low-frequency (2–5%) SNVs, we re-ran VarScan with adjusted parameters: min-coverage=100, min-var-freq=0.02, somatic-p-value<0.01, validation=1. In validation mode, VarScan reads data from tumor and normal samples simultaneously, performing pair-wise comparisons at every position covered in both samples. Each position is classified as Reference (wild-type), Germline, LOH, or Somatic, based upon a comparison of the consensus genotypes and supporting read counts (Fisher’s Exact test). Positions called Somatic are further subjected to our internally-developed false-positive filter which removes sequencing- and alignment-related artifacts using several criteria (read count, mapping quality, average read position, strand representation, homopolymer-like sequence context, mismatch quality sum difference, trimmed read length, Q2 distance) and were manually reviewed. Chromosome X and Y somatic positions are determined using the false-positive filter and manual review. SIFT and PolyPhen2 computational algorithms were used to predict whether U2AF1 mutations were damaging, as previously described43,44.  Sanger sequencing  To screen for recurrence of U2AF1 mutations, we performed Sanger sequencing using whole genome amplified DNA extracted from unfractionated bone marrow aspirates and paired normal tissue (skin) from 150 individual patients with de novo MDS. PCR amplicons covering all 9 exons and splice sites in U2AF1 were sequenced using BigDye chemistry and analyzed on an ABI 3730 sequencer (primer sequences in Supplementary Table 8). Sequence variants were called by The Genome Institute’s mutational profiling pipeline and manually reviewed. Potential somatic mutations (present in the bone marrow sample and not detectable in skin) were confirmed by independent PCR and sequencing.  Deep sequencing of U2AF1 mutations in DNA and cDNA  Unfractionated bone marrow samples from 11 patients with validated U2AF1 mutations were selected for deep sequencing to estimate clone size. Whole genome amplified DNA from normal (skin), MDS, and sAML samples were amplified by PCR individually using barcoded primers (Supplementary Table 8). The products were then pooled and sequenced on the Roche/454 platform. In parallel, RNA was extracted from MDS and sAML samples (Trizol, Invitrogen), converted to cDNA using the Ovation RNA-seq Kit (NuGEN), and amplified with barcoded primers spanning intron/exon boundaries (Supplementary Table 8). Reads were aligned to Hs36 using BWA-SW39. Following alignment, BAM and pileup files were generated using SAMtools and analyzed by Picard to remove duplicates. Only uniquely mapped bases with >q20 scores were retained. Reads supporting the reference or variant allele were identified by VarScan2.  SNP array analysis  Genomic DNA samples (not subjected to whole genome amplification) from the normal, MDS, and sAML specimens (not flow-sorted) were hybridized to Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays (Affymetrix, Inc.). Analysis of copy number alterations and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite (Partek, Inc).  mRNA expression profiling  Total RNA was harvested from unfractionated bone marrow cells (69% myeloblast) from the secondary AML sample from UPN 266395 and hybridized to the Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST array. Raw data was extracted using the Affymetrix Expression Console (Affymetrix, Inc.) and analyzed in Prism 5.04 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).  Total RNA was harvested from CD34+ purified MDS bone marrow samples (n=15) and control bone marrow (n=4) and hybridized to the Affymetrix U133plus2 array, as previously reported18. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed using Ward’s clustering algorithm with a Euclidean distance similarity measure in Spotfire (TIBCO Software Inc). Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7b were performed as previously described19,45,46.  Reverse transcriptase PCR  cDNA was made from RNA using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase or Superscript III kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) (primer and probe sequences for GAPDH are provided in47). The U2AF1 primer and probe set spans exons 2–3 (Hs00739599_m1, Applied Biosystems). All samples were run in duplicate on a 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using the relative standard curve method. Non-quantitative RT-PCR for U2AF1 mRNA isoform expression was performed and loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Forward: 5′-GCCTCCATCTTCGGCACCGA-3′, Reverse: 5′-GGCATGGCTCAGAATCGCCC-3′).  Generation of U2AF1 expression plasmids  RNA from a patient bone marrow biopsy (UPN 571656) was used to generate both U2AF1 (wild-type) and U2AF1 (S34F mutant) expression vectors. cDNA was generated from patient bone marrow RNA using Superscript III kit (Invitrogen). Both wild-type and mutant U2AF1 cDNAs were obtained via PCR amplification, cloned with the Topo Cloning kit (Invitrogen), and sequenced for verification. The U2AF1 cDNAs were then shuttled into the EcoRI site of the pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen) for transient transfection experiments.  Luciferase-β-galactosidase double-reporter assay  293T cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (1 × 106 per well) and cultured in DMEM (Gibco/Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and L-glutamine. Following overnight culture, cells were co-transfected with the expression vectors (U2AF1 wild-type or S34F mutant, or empty vector) and the pTN24 splicing reporter plasmid (containing a constitutively expressed β-galactosidase reporter for transfection normalization and a luciferase reporter that is conditional on removal of a translational stop codon by splicing) with or without splicing modulators hnRNPG and Tra2α17. In some experiments, cells were also co-transfected with 30nM U2AF1-specific siRNA (5′-CGUAGAAAGUGUUGUAGUUGAUUGA-3′; IDT, Inc.) or 30nM siRNA scramble control (Dharmacon). Cells were harvested 48 hours following transfection, and reporter expression was detected, as previously described17 using the Dual Light Reporter System (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed by calculating the ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase signal. Changes in U2AF1 levels were confirmed by Western blot using antibodies specific for U2AF1 (SAS1300700, Sigma-Aldrich) or β-actin (A5441, Sigma-Aldrich) as a loading control. Three independent experiments were performed and the data was analyzed using a Student’s t-test.  Minigene constructs and transfection  293T cells were cultured and transfected with U2AF1 expression vectors, as above. Cells were also co-transfected with a GH1 minigene splicing reporter construct9. In other experiments, cells were co-transfected with a FMR1 minigene splicing reporter construct containing partial sequence from exons 14 and 15 and the complete intronic sequence. Amplification of the FMR1 DNA fragment (including the intron) was achieved using the FMR1-201 E15 set of primer sequences previously published10. The amplified fragment was cloned into the TopoTA vector (Invitrogen), purified following BamH1 and XhoI digestion, and subsequently cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Co-transfection of U2AF1 or control siRNAs was also performed, as above. Cells were harvested 48 hours following transfection, and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis via RT-PCR with random hexamers and oligo(dT) primers. Changes in minigene splicing were then measured by PCR of the cDNA using a T7 forward primer and gene-specific reverse primers as previously described9,10 and quantified by densitometry. U2AF1 knockdown by siRNA and U2AF1 reconstitution were confirmed by Western blot analysis, as above. Three to four independent experiments were performed and the data was analyzed using a Student’s t-test. Whole-exome sequencing studies have identified common mutations affecting genes encoding components of the RNA splicing machinery in hematological malignancies. Here, we sought to determine how mutations affecting the 3′ splice site recognition factor U2AF1 alter its normal role in RNA splicing. We find that U2AF1 mutations influence the similarity of splicing programs in leukemias, but do not give rise to widespread splicing failure. U2AF1 mutations cause differential splicing of hundreds of genes, affecting biological pathways such as DNA methylation (DNMT3B), X chromosome inactivation (H2AFY), the DNA damage response (ATR, FANCA), and apoptosis (CASP8). We show that U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3′ splice site motif in patients, in cell culture, and in vitro. Mutations affecting the first and second zinc fingers give rise to different alterations in splice site preference and largely distinct downstream splicing programs. These allele-specific effects are consistent with a computationally predicted model of U2AF1 in complex with RNA. Our findings suggest that U2AF1 mutations contribute to pathogenesis by causing quantitative changes in splicing that affect diverse cellular pathways, and give insight into the normal function of U2AF1’s zinc finger domains.  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of blood disorders characterized by dysplastic and ineffective hematopoiesis. Patients frequently suffer from cytopenias and are at increased risk for disease transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Tefferi and Vardiman 2009). The only curative treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, for which most patients are ineligible due to advanced age at diagnosis. The development of new therapies has been slowed by our incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease.  Recent sequencing studies of MDS patient exomes identified common mutations affecting genes encoding components of the RNA splicing machinery, with ∼45%–85% of patients affected (Graubert et al. 2011; Papaemmanuil et al. 2011; Yoshida et al. 2011; Visconte et al. 2012). Spliceosomal genes are the most common targets of somatic point mutations in MDS, suggesting that dysregulated splicing may constitute a common theme linking the disparate disorders that comprise MDS. Just four genes—SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2—carry the bulk of the mutations, which are mutually exclusive and occur in heterozygous contexts (Yoshida et al. 2011). Targeted sequencing studies identified high-frequency mutations in these genes in other hematological malignancies as well, including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and AML with myelodysplastic features (Yoshida et al. 2011). Of the four commonly mutated genes, SF3B1, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 encode proteins involved in 3′ splice site recognition (Shen et al. 2010; Cvitkovic and Jurica 2012), suggesting that altered 3′ splice site recognition is an important feature of the pathogenesis of MDS and related myeloid neoplasms.  U2AF1 (also known as U2AF35) may provide a useful model system to dissect the molecular consequences of MDS-associated spliceosomal gene mutations. U2AF1 mutations are highly specific—they uniformly affect the S34 and Q157 residues within the first and second CCCH zinc fingers of the protein—making comprehensive studies of all mutant alleles feasible (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, U2AF1’s biochemical role in binding the AG dinucleotide of the 3′ splice site is relatively well-defined (Merendino et al. 1999; Wu et al. 1999; Zorio and Blumenthal 1999). U2AF1 preferentially recognizes the core RNA sequence motif yAG|r (Fig. 1B), which matches the genomic consensus 3′ splice site and intron|exon boundary that crosslinks with U2AF1 (Wu et al. 1999). Nevertheless, our understanding of U2AF1:RNA interactions is incomplete. U2AF1’s U2AF homology motif (UHM) is known to mediate U2AF1:U2AF2 heterodimer formation (Kielkopf et al. 2001); however, both the specific protein domains that give rise to U2AF1’s RNA binding specificity and the normal function of U2AF1’s zinc fingers are unknown. Accordingly, the precise mechanistic consequences of U2AF1 mutations are difficult to predict.  Figure 1. Figure 1. U2AF1 mutations contribute to splicing programs in AML. (A) U2AF1 domain structure (Kielkopf et al. 2001; The UniProt Consortium 2012) and common mutations. (CCCH) CCCH zinc finger. (B) Schematic of U2AF1 interaction with the 3′ splice site of ... Since the initial reports of common U2AF1 mutations in MDS, the molecular consequences of U2AF1 mutations have been controversial. An early study found that overexpression of mutant U2AF1 in HeLa cells resulted in dysfunctional splicing marked by frequent inclusion of premature termination codons and intron retention (Yoshida et al. 2011), while another early study reported increased exon skipping in a minigene assay following mutant U2AF1 expression in 293T cells, as well as increased cryptic splice site usage in the FMR1 gene in MDS samples (Graubert et al. 2011). U2AF1 mutations have been suggested to cause both alteration/gain of function (Graubert et al. 2011) and loss of function (Yoshida et al. 2011; Makishima et al. 2012). More recently, two studies analyzed acute myeloid leukemia transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and found that exons with increased or decreased inclusion in samples with U2AF1 mutations exhibited different nucleotides prior to the AG of the 3′ splice site (Przychodzen et al. 2013; Brooks et al. 2014), suggesting that U2AF1 mutations may cause specific alterations to the RNA splicing process.  To determine how U2AF1 mutations alter RNA splicing in hematopoietic cells, we combined patient data, cell culture experiments, and biochemical studies. We found that U2AF1 mutations cause splicing alterations in biological pathways previously implicated in myeloid malignancies, including epigenetic regulation and the DNA damage response. U2AF1 mutations drive differential splicing by altering the preferred 3′ splice site motif in an allele-specific manner. Our results identify downstream targets of U2AF1 mutations that may contribute to pathogenesis, show that different U2AF1 mutations are not mechanistically equivalent, and give insight into the normal function of U2AF1’s zinc finger domains.  Go to: Results U2AF1 mutations are associated with distinct splicing programs in AML  We first tested whether U2AF1 mutations were relevant to splicing programs in leukemias with an unbiased approach. We quantified genome-wide cassette exon splicing in the transcriptomes of 169 de novo adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples that were sequenced as part of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2013) and performed unsupervised cluster analysis. Five of the seven samples carrying a U2AF1 mutation clustered together (Fig. 1C). One of the samples that fell outside of this cluster had a Q157 rather than S34 U2AF1 mutation, and the other carried a mutation in the putative RNA splicing gene KHDRBS3 in addition to a U2AF1 mutation, potentially contributing to its placement in an outgroup. Both of the outgroup U2AF1 mutant samples additionally had low mutant allele expression relative to wild-type (WT) allele expression (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that U2AF1 mutations are associated with distinct splicing patterns in patients and are consistent with a recent report that spliceosomal mutations define a subgroup of myeloid malignancies based on gene expression and DNA methylation patterns (Taskesen et al. 2014).  U2AF1 mutations alter RNA splicing in blood cells  To determine how U2AF1 mutations affect RNA splicing in an experimentally tractable system, we generated K562 erythroleukemic cell lines that stably expressed transgenic FLAG-tagged U2AF1 protein (WT, S34F, S34Y, Q157P, or Q157R mutations) at modest levels in the presence of the endogenous protein (Fig. 2A). This expression strategy, in which the transgene was modestly overexpressed at levels of 1.8–4.7× endogenous U2AF1 (Fig. 2B), is consistent with the coexpression of WT and mutant alleles at approximately equal levels that we observed in AML transcriptomes. Similar coexpression of WT and mutant alleles has been previously reported in MDS patients carrying U2AF1 mutations (Graubert et al. 2011). We separately knocked down (KD) endogenous U2AF1 to ∼13% of normal U2AF1 protein levels in the absence of transgenic expression to test whether the mutations cause gain or loss of function (Fig. 2A).  Figure 2. Figure 2. U2AF1 mutations alter splicing, but do not cause splicing failure. (A) Western blots showing levels of FLAG-tagged U2AF1 in K562 cells stably expressing the indicated alleles (top) and levels of endogenous U2AF1 in K562 cells following transfection with ... To identify mutation-dependent changes in splicing, we performed deep RNA-seq on these K562 cell lines stably expressing each mutant protein and on the control and U2AF1 KD cells (∼100M 2 × 49 bp reads per cell line). This provided sufficient read coverage to measure quantitative inclusion of ∼20,000 cassette exons that were alternatively spliced in K562 cells. Unsupervised cluster analysis of global cassette exon inclusion in these cell lines placed S34F/Y and Q157P/R as distinct groups and revealed that mutations within the first and second zinc fingers are associated with largely distinct patterns of exon inclusion (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with our cluster analysis of AML transcriptomes, in which the one sample with a Q157 mutation was placed as an outgroup to samples with S34 mutations.  We next assembled comprehensive maps of splicing changes driven by U2AF1 mutations in AML transcriptomes, K562 cells expressing mutant U2AF1, and K562 cells following U2AF1 KD. We tested ∼125,000 annotated alternative splicing events for differential splicing and assayed ∼160,000 constitutive splice junctions for evidence of novel alternative splicing or intron retention. We required a minimum change in isoform ratio of 10% to call an event differentially spliced. As our cluster analysis of K562 cells indicated that S34 and Q157 mutations generated distinct splicing patterns, we compared the six S34 AML samples to all U2AF1 WT AML samples. We separately identified splicing changes caused by both S34F and S34Y or both Q157P and Q157R in K562 cells relative to the WT control cells. The resulting catalogs of differentially spliced events revealed that all major classes of alternative splicing events, including cassette exons, competing splice sites, and retained introns, were affected by U2AF1 mutations (Fig. 2D; Supplemental Files S1–S5). Cassette exons constituted the majority of affected splicing events, followed by alternative splicing or intron retention of splice junctions annotated as constitutive in the UCSC Genome Browser (Meyer et al. 2013).  Thousands of splicing events were affected by each U2AF1 mutation, but the fraction of differentially spliced events was relatively low. For example, >400 frame-preserving cassette exons were differentially spliced in association with S34Y versus WT U2AF1 mutations; however, those >400 cassette exons constituted only ∼3.6% of frame-preserving cassette exons that are alternatively spliced in K562 cells (Fig. 2E). Expression of any mutant allele caused differential splicing of 2%–5% of frame-preserving cassette exons, with a bias toward exon skipping (Supplemental Fig. S1A). We did not observe increased levels of retained introns or isoforms that are predicted substrates for degradation by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) in association with any U2AF1 mutation. Instead, constitutive intron removal appeared slightly more efficient in cells expressing mutant versus WT U2AF1 (Fig. 2F; Supplemental Fig. S1B,C). In contrast, we did observe increased levels of predicted NMD substrates and mRNAs with unspliced introns following U2AF1 KD (Supplemental Fig. S1B,C). Consistent with these findings in K562 cells, AML samples carrying U2AF1 mutations did not exhibit increased levels of NMD substrates or intron retention (Fig. 2G; Supplemental Figs. S2–S4). We conclude that S34 and Q157 U2AF1 mutations cause splicing changes affecting hundreds of exons, but do not give rise to widespread splicing failure.  These results contrast with a previous report that the U2AF1 S34F mutation causes overproduction of mRNAs slated for degradation and genome-wide intron retention (Yoshida et al. 2011). The discrepancy between those results and our observations are likely due to differing experimental designs. This previous study acutely expressed the S34F mutation at ∼50× WT levels in HeLa cells, whereas we stably expressed each mutant protein at 1.8–4.7× WT levels in blood cells (Fig. 1D). Maintaining a balance between WT and mutant protein expression—like that observed in AML and MDS patients—may be important to maintain efficient splicing.  U2AF1 mutations cause differential splicing of cancer-relevant genes  We next sought to identify downstream targets of U2AF1 mutations that might contribute to myeloid pathogenesis. We took a conservative approach of requiring differential splicing in AML transcriptomes as well as in K562 cells to help identify disease-relevant events that are likely direct consequences of U2AF1 mutations. We intersected differentially spliced events identified in three distinct comparisons: AML S34 versus WT samples, K562 S34 versus WT expression, and K562 Q157 versus WT expression. Of AML S34-associated differential splicing, 16.8% was phenocopied in K562 S34 cells versus 4.6% for K562 Q157 cells, consistent with allele-specific effects of U2AF1 mutations (Fig. 3A). The relatively low overlap of ∼17% between AML and K562 S34-associated differential splicing is likely due to differences in gene expression patterns between K562 and AML cells, the modest nature of splicing changes caused by U2AF1 mutations (such that many changes fall near the border of our statistical thresholds for differential splicing), and our stringent restriction to events that are differentially spliced in association with both S34F and S34Y mutations in K562 cells. This analysis revealed 54 splicing events that were affected by both S34 and Q157 mutations in AML transcriptomes and K562 cells. When we instead intersected genes containing differentially spliced events—not requiring that identical exons or splice sites be affected—we found a substantially increased intersection of 140 genes (Table 1).  Figure 3. Figure 3. U2AF1 mutations affect genes involved in disease-relevant cellular processes. (A) Overlap between mutation-dependent differential splicing in AML S34F/Y patients, K562 S34F/Y cells, and K562 Q157P/R cells. Overlap taken at the level of specific events ... Table 1. Table 1. Genes that are differentially spliced in association with U2AF1 mutations Many genes that were differentially spliced in association with U2AF1 mutations participate in biological pathways previously implicated in myeloid malignancies. For example, DNMT3A encodes a de novo DNA methyltransferase and is a common mutational target in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (Ley et al. 2010; Walter et al. 2011). Multiple exons of its paralog DNMT3B, including an exon encoding part of the methyltransferase domain, are differentially spliced in AML patients carrying U2AF1 mutations as well as in K562 cells expressing U2AF1 mutant protein (Fig. 3B–D; Supplemental Fig. S5A,B). Similarly, different exons of ASXL1 are alternatively spliced in association with S34 mutations in AML transcriptomes and K562 cells, although the same exons are not consistently affected (Supplemental Files S1–S5). ASXL1 is a common mutational target in myelodysplastic syndromes and related disorders (Gelsi-Boyer et al. 2009), and U2AF1 and ASXL1 mutations co-occur more frequently than expected by chance (Thol et al. 2012). Other genes participating in epigenetic processes are differentially spliced as well, such as H2AFY (Fig. 3E; Supplemental Fig. S5C). H2AFY encodes the core histone macro-H2A.1, which is important for X chromosome inactivation (Hernández-Muñoz et al. 2005). As loss of X chromosome inactivation causes an MDS-like disease in mice (Yildirim et al. 2013), differential splicing of macro-H2A.1 could potentially be relevant to disease processes.  Isoform switches, wherein a previously minor isoform becomes the major isoform, were relatively rare but did occur. For example, a cassette exon at the 3′ end of the ATR gene, which encodes a PI3K-related kinase that activates the DNA damage checkpoint, is included at high rates in association with S34, but not Q157, mutations. This cassette exon alters the C terminus of the ATR protein, may render the mRNA susceptible to nonsense-mediated decay, and is highly conserved (Fig. 3F,G; Supplemental Fig. S5D). S34 mutations similarly cause an isoform switch from an intron-proximal to an intron-distal 3′ splice site of CASP8 that is predicted to shorten the N terminus of the protein (Fig. 3H; Supplemental Fig. S5E).  We noticed that splicing changes frequently affected multiple genes relevant to a specific biological process, such as DNA damage (ATR and FANCA) (Fig. 3G,I; Supplemental Fig. S5D,F). Consistent with this observation, Gene Ontology analysis indicated that genes involved in the cell cycle, chromatin modification, DNA methylation, DNA repair, and RNA processing pathways, among others, are enriched for differential splicing in both AML transcriptomes and K562 cells in association with U2AF1 mutations. This enrichment could be due to high basal rates of alternative splicing within these genes, which frequently are composed of many exons, or instead caused by specific targeting by mutant U2AF1. Upon correcting for gene-specific variation in the number of possible alternatively spliced isoforms, these pathways were no longer enriched in Gene Ontology analyses. We conclude that U2AF1 mutations preferentially affect specific biological pathways, but that this enrichment is due to frequent alternative splicing within such genes rather than specific targeting by U2AF1 mutant protein.  U2AF1 mutations cause allele-specific alterations in the 3′ splice site consensus  Previous biochemical studies showed that U2AF1 recognizes the core sequence motif yAG|r of the 3′ splice site (Merendino et al. 1999; Wu et al. 1999; Zorio and Blumenthal 1999). Accordingly, we hypothesized that the splicing changes caused by U2AF1 mutations might be due to preferential activation or repression of 3′ splice sites in a sequence-specific manner. To test this hypothesis, we identified consensus 3′ splice sites of cassette exons that were promoted or repressed in AML transcriptomes carrying U2AF1 mutations relative to WT patients. For each mutant U2AF1 sample, we enumerated all cassette exons that were differentially spliced between the sample and an average U2AF1 WT sample, requiring a minimum change in isoform ratio of 10%. Exons whose inclusion was increased or decreased in U2AF1 mutant samples exhibited different consensus nucleotides at the −3 and +1 positions flanking the AG of the 3′ splice site. As these positions correspond to the yAG|r motif bound by U2AF1, this data supports our hypothesis that U2AF1 mutations alter 3′ splice site recognition activity in a sequence-specific manner (Fig. 4A).  Figure 4. Figure 4. U2AF1 mutations alter 3′ splice site consensus sequences. (A) Consensus 3′ splice sites of cassette exons with increased or decreased inclusion in U2AF1 mutant relative to WT AML transcriptomes. Boxes highlight sequence preferences at ... Mutations affecting different residues of U2AF1 were associated with distinct alterations in the consensus 3′ splice site motif yAG|r of differentially spliced exons. The S34F and S34Y mutations, affecting the first zinc finger, were associated with nearly identical alterations at the −3 position in all six S34 mutant samples, whereas the Q157P mutation, affecting the second zinc finger, was associated with alterations at the +1 position (Supplemental Fig. S6). In contrast, cassette exons that were differentially spliced in randomly chosen U2AF1 WT samples relative to an average AML sample did not exhibit altered consensus sequences at the −3 or +1 positions (Supplemental Fig. S7). These results confirm the findings of two recent studies of this cohort of AML patients—which reported a frequent preference for C instead of T at the −3 position of differentially spliced cassette exons in U2AF1 mutant samples (Przychodzen et al. 2013; Brooks et al. 2014)—and extend their observations of altered splice site preference to show allele-specific effects of U2AF1 mutations, which have not been previously identified.  U2AF1 mutation-dependent sequence preferences (C/A >> T at the −3 position for S34F/Y and G >> A at the +1 position for Q157P) differ from the genomic consensus for cassette exons. C/T and G/A appear at similar frequencies at the −3 and +1 positions of 3′ splice sites of cassette exons (Supplemental Fig. S6,7), and minigene and genomic studies of competing 3′ splice sites indicate that C and T are approximately equally effective at the −3 position (Smith et al. 1993; Bradley et al. 2012). The consensus 3′ splice sites associated with promoted/repressed cassette exons in U2AF1 mutant transcriptomes also differ from U2AF1’s known RNA binding specificity. A previous study reported a core tAG|g motif in the majority of RNA sequences bound by U2AF1 in a SELEX experiment (Wu et al. 1999). Comparing that motif with preferences observed in U2AF1 mutant transcriptomes, we hypothesize that S34 U2AF1 promotes unusual recognition of C instead of T at the −3 position, while Q157 U2AF1 reinforces preferential recognition of G instead of A at the +1 position.  We next tested whether these alterations in 3′ splice site preference are a direct consequence of U2AF1 mutations. Comparing K562 cells expressing mutant versus WT U2AF1, we found that cassette exons that were promoted or repressed by each mutation exhibited sequence preferences at the −3 and +1 positions that were highly similar to those observed in AML patient samples (Fig. 4B). Mutations affecting identical residues (S34F/Y and Q157P/R) caused similar alterations in 3′ splice site preference, whereas mutations affecting different residues did not, confirming the allele-specific consequences of U2AF1 mutations. In contrast, cassette exons that were differentially spliced following KD of endogenous U2AF1 did not exhibit sequence-specific changes at the −3 or +1 positions of the 3′ splice site (Fig. 4C). We therefore conclude that S34 and Q157 mutations cause alteration or gain of function, consistent with the empirical absence of inactivating (nonsense or frameshift) U2AF1 mutations observed in patients.  U2AF1 mutations preferentially affect U2AF1-dependent 3′ splice sites  U2AF1 mutations are associated with altered 3′ splice site consensus sequences, yet only a relatively small fraction of cassette exons are affected by expression of U2AF1 mutant protein. Previous biochemical studies found that only a subset of exons have “AG-dependent” 3′ splice sites that require U2AF1 binding for proper splice site recognition (Reed 1989; Wu et al. 1999). We therefore speculated that exons that are sensitive to U2AF1 mutations might also rely upon U2AF1 recruitment for normal splicing. We empirically defined U2AF1-dependent exons as those with decreased inclusion following U2AF1 KD and computed the overlap between U2AF1-dependent exons and exons that were affected by U2AF1 mutant protein expression. For every mutation, we observed an enrichment for overlap with U2AF1-dependent exons, suggesting that U2AF1 mutations preferentially affect exons with AG-dependent splice sites (Fig. 4D).  U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3′ splice site motif yAG|r  Our genomics data shows that cassette exons promoted/repressed by U2AF1 mutations have 3′ splice sites differing from the consensus. We therefore tested whether altering the core 3′ splice site motif of an exon influenced its recognition in the presence of WT versus mutant U2AF1. We created a minigene encoding a cassette exon of ATR, which responds robustly to S34 mutations in AML transcriptomes and K562 cells (Fig. 3F,G), by cloning the genomic locus containing the ATR cassette exon and flanking constitutive introns and exons into a plasmid. The minigene exhibited mutation-dependent splicing of the cassette exon, as expected, although cassette exon recognition was less efficient than from the endogenous locus. We then mutated the −3 position of the cassette exon’s 3′ splice site to A/C/G/T and measured cassette exon inclusion in WT and S34Y K562 cells. Robust mutation-dependent increases in splicing required the A at the −3 position found in the endogenous locus, consistent with the unusual preference for A observed in our analyses of AML and K562 transcriptomes. We additionally observed a small but reproducible increase for C (Fig. 5A). We next performed similar experiments for Q157-dependent splicing changes. We created a minigene encoding a cassette exon of EPB49 (encoding the erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.9), mutated the +1 position of the 3′ splice site to A/C/G/T, and measured cassette exon inclusion in WT and Q157R K562 cells. Cassette exon recognition was suppressed by Q157R expression when the +1 position was an A, consistent with our genomic prediction, and was not affected by Q157R when the +1 position was mutated to another nucleotide. Therefore, for both ATR and EPB49, robust S34 and Q157-dependent changes in splicing required the endogenous nucleotides at the −3 and +1 positions.  Figure 5. Figure 5. U2AF1 mutations cause sequence-dependent changes in 3′ splice site recognition. (A) Schematic of ATR minigene (top) and inclusion of ATR cassette exon transcribed from minigenes with A/C/G/T at the −3 position of the 3′ splice ... We next tested how U2AF1 mutations influence constitutive, rather than alternative, splicing in an in vitro context. We used the adenovirus major late (AdML) substrate, a standard model of constitutive splicing, and mutated the −3 position of the 3′ splice site to C/T. We measured AdML splicing efficiency following in vitro transcription and incubation with nuclear extract of K562 cells expressing WT or S34Y U2AF1. The AdML substrate exhibited sequence-specific changes in splicing efficiency in association with U2AF1 mutations. Consistent with our genomic analyses, AdML with C/T at the −3 position was more/less efficiently spliced in S34Y versus WT cells (Fig. 5C). Taken together, our data demonstrate that U2AF1 mutations cause sequence-specific alterations in the preferred 3′ splice site motif in patients, in cell culture, and in vitro.  U2AF1 mutations may modify U2AF1:RNA interactions  Because U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3′ splice site motif yAG|r—the same motif that is recognized and bound by U2AF1 (Wu et al. 1999)—we next investigated whether U2AF1 mutations could potentially modify U2AF1’s RNA binding activity. U2AF1’s RNA binding specificity could originate from its U2AF homology motif (UHM) and/or its two CCCH zinc fingers. The UHM domain mediates U2AF heterodimer formation and is sufficient to promote splicing of an AG-dependent pre-mRNA substrate (Guth et al. 2001; Kielkopf et al. 2001). However, this domain binds a consensus 3′ splice site sequence with low affinity (Kielkopf et al. 2001), suggesting that it may be insufficient to generate U2AF1’s sequence specificity. Because U2AF1’s zinc fingers are independently required for U2AF RNA binding (Webb and Wise 2004), and our data indicate that zinc finger mutations alter splice site preferences, we hypothesized that U2AF1’s zinc fingers might directly interact with the 3′ splice site.  To evaluate whether this hypothesis is sterically possible, we started from the experimentally determined structure of the UHM domain in complex with a peptide from U2AF2 (Kielkopf et al. 2001), modeled the conformations of the zinc finger domains bound to RNA by aligning them to the CCCH zinc finger domains in the TIS11d:RNA complex structure (Hudson et al. 2004), and sampled the conformations of the two short linker regions using fragment assembly techniques (Leaver-Fay et al. 2011). The RNA was built in two segments taken from the TIS11d complex, one anchored in the N-terminal zinc finger and one in the C-terminal finger. We modeled multiple 3′ splice site sequences (primarily variants of uuAG|ruu) and explored a range of possible alignments of the 3′ splice site within the complex. The final register was selected on the basis of energetic analysis and manual inspection using known features of the specificity pattern of the 3′ splice site (in particular, the lack of a significant genomic consensus at the −4 and +3 positions, consistent with the experimental absence of a crosslink between U2AF1 and the −4 position) (Wu et al. 1999).  Based on these simulations, we propose a theoretical model of U2AF1 in complex with RNA wherein the zinc finger domains guide recognition of the yAG|r motif, consistent with the predictions of our mutational data. The model has the following features (Fig. 6A; Supplemental File S6). The first zinc finger contacts the bases immediately preceding the splice site, including the AG dinucleotide (Fig. 6B,C), while the second zinc finger binds immediately downstream (Fig. 6D). The RNA is kinked at the splice site and bent overall throughout the complex so that both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the motif are oriented toward the UHM domain and U2AF2 peptide. Contacts compatible with the 3′ splice site consensus are observed at the sequence-constrained RNA positions. The mutated positions S34 and Q157 are near the bases at which perturbed splice site preferences are observed for their respective mutations. Moreover, the modified preferences can, to some extent, be rationalized by contacts seen in our simulations. S34 forms a hydrogen bond with U(−1), and preference for U at −1 appears to decrease upon mutation; the Q157P mutation would improve electrostatic complementarity with G at +1 by removing a backbone NH group, in agreement with increased G preference in this mutant.  Figure 6. Figure 6. Theoretical model of the U2AF1:RNA complex. (A) Overview, with the zinc finger domains colored cyan, the RNA in salmon, the UHM beta sheet in blue, and alpha helices in red. The frequently mutated positions S34 and Q157 are shown in stick representation. ... Go to: Discussion Here, we have described the mechanistic consequences of U2AF1 mutations in hematopoietic cells and provided a catalog of splicing changes driven by each common U2AF1 mutation. U2AF1 mutations cause highly specific alterations in 3′ splice site recognition in myeloid neoplasms. Taken together with the high frequency of mutations targeting U2AF1 and genes encoding other 3′ splice site recognition factors, our results support the hypothesis that specific alterations in 3′ splice site recognition are important contributors to the molecular pathology of MDS and related hematological disorders.  We observed consistent differential splicing of multiple genes, such as DNMT3B and FANCA, that participate in molecular pathways previously implicated in blood disease. It is tempting to speculate that differential splicing of a few such genes in well-characterized pathways explain how U2AF1 mutations drive disease. However, we instead hypothesize that spliceosomal mutations contribute to dysplastic hematopoiesis and tumorigenesis by dysregulating a multitude of genes involved in many aspects of cell physiology. This hypothesis is consistent with two notable features of our data. First, hundreds of exons are differentially spliced in response to U2AF1 mutations. Second, many of the splicing changes are relatively modest. In both the AML and K562 data, we observed relatively few isoform switches, with the ATR and CASP8 examples illustrated in Figure 3 being notable exceptions. Therefore, we expect that specific targets such as DNMT3B probably contribute to, but do not wholly explain, U2AF1 mutation-induced pathophysiology. As additional data from tumor transcriptome sequencing become available—for example, as more patient transcriptomes carrying Q157 mutations are sequenced—precisely identifying disease-relevant changes in splicing will become increasingly reliable.  Our understanding of the molecular consequences of U2AF1 mutations will also benefit from further experiments conducted during the differentiation process. Both the AML and K562 data arose from relatively “static” systems, in the sense that the bulk of the assayed cells were not actively undergoing lineage specification. U2AF1 mutations likely cause similar changes in splice site recognition in both precursor and more differentiated cells, but altered splice site recognition could have additional consequences in specific cell types. A recent study reported that regulated intron retention is important for granulopoiesis (Wong et al. 2013), consistent with the idea that as-yet-unrecognized shifts in RNA processing may occur during hematopoiesis. By disrupting such global processes, altered splice site recognition could contribute to the ineffective hematopoiesis that characterizes MDS.  Relevance to future studies of spliceosomal mutations  Both mechanistic and phenotypic studies of cancer-associated somatic mutations frequently focus on single mutations, even when multiple distinct mutations affecting that gene occur at high rates. Similarly, distinct mutations affecting the same gene are frequently grouped together in prognostic and other clinical studies, thereby implicitly assuming that different mutations have similar physiological consequences. Our finding that different U2AF1 mutations are not mechanistically equivalent illustrates the value of studying all high-frequency mutations when feasible. The distinctiveness of S34 and Q157 mutation-induced alterations in 3′ splice site preference suggests that they could theoretically constitute clinically relevant disease subtypes, potentially contributing to the heterogeneity of MDS. Mutations affecting other spliceosomal genes may likewise have allele-specific consequences. For example, mutations at codons 625 versus 700 of SF3B1 are most commonly associated with uveal melanoma (Harbour et al. 2013; Martin et al. 2013) versus MDS (Graubert et al. 2011; Papaemmanuil et al. 2011; Yoshida et al. 2011; Visconte et al. 2012) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Quesada et al. 2011). Accordingly, we speculate that stratifying patients by mutation could prove fruitful for future studies of spliceosomal gene mutations.  Our study additionally illustrates how investigating disease-associated somatic mutations can give insight into the normal function of proteins. With a fairly restricted set of assumptions, we computationally predicted a family of models in which the first zinc finger of U2AF1 recognizes the AG dinucleotide of the 3′ splice site. As a computational prediction, the model must be tested with future experiments. Nonetheless, given the concordance between our theoretical model of U2AF1:RNA interactions and our mutational data, this model may provide a useful framework for future studies of U2AF1 function in both healthy and diseased cells.  Go to: Methods Vector construction and cell culture  Inserts encoding bicistronic constructs of the form U2AF1 + Gly Gly + FLAG + T2A + mCherry were created by standard methods (details in Supplemental Methods). These inserts were cloned into the self-inactivating lentiviral vector pRRLSIN.cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE (Addgene Plasmid 12252). The resulting plasmids coexpress U2AF1 and mCherry under control of the PGK promoter. K562 erythroleukemia cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. To generate stable cell lines, K562 cells were infected with concentrated lentiviral supernatants at a MOI of ∼5 in growth media supplemented with 8 μg/mL protamine sulfate. Cells were then expanded, and transduced cells expressing mCherry were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using a Becton Dickinson FACSAria II equipped with a 561-nm laser. For RNAi studies, K562 cells were transfected with a control (nontargeting) siRNA (Dharmacon D-001810-03-20) or a siRNA pool against U2AF1 (Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool L-012325-01-0005) using the Nucleofector II device from Lonza with the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V (program T16), and RNA and protein were collected 48 h after transfection.  mRNA sequencing  Total RNA was obtained by lysing 10 million K562 cells for each sample in TRIzol, and RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy columns. Using 4 μg of total RNA, we prepared poly(A)-selected, unstranded libraries for Illumina sequencing using a modified version of the TruSeq protocol (details in Supplemental Methods). RNA-seq libraries were then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 to a depth of ∼100 million 2 × 49 bp reads per sample.  Accession numbers  For the AML analysis, BAM files were downloaded from CGHub (“LAML” project) and converted to FASTQ files of unaligned reads for subsequent read mapping. For the HeLa cell analysis, FASTQ files were downloaded from DDBJ series DRA000503 (http://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/), and the reads were trimmed to 50 bp (after removing the first five bp) to restrict to the high-quality portion of the reads. A similar trimming procedure was performed in the original manuscript (Yoshida et al. 2011).  Genome annotations and read mapping  MISO v2.0 annotations were used for cassette exon, competing 5′ and 3′ splice sites, and retained intron events (Katz et al. 2010). Constitutive junctions were defined as splice junctions that were not alternatively spliced in any isoform of the UCSC knownGene track (Meyer et al. 2013). For read mapping purposes, a gene annotation file was created by combining isoforms from the MISO v2.0 (Katz et al. 2010), UCSC knownGene (Meyer et al. 2013), and Ensembl 71 (Flicek et al. 2013) annotations for the UCSC hg19 (NCBI GRCh37) human genome assembly, and a splice junction annotation file was created by enumerating all possible combinations of annotated splice sites as previously described (Hubert et al. 2013). RSEM (Li and Dewey 2011) and Bowtie (Langmead et al. 2009) were used to map reads to the gene annotation file, and TopHat (Trapnell et al. 2009) was used to align remaining unaligned reads to the genome and splice junctions (full details in Supplemental Methods).  Isoform expression measurements  MISO (Katz et al. 2010) and v2.0 of its annotations were used to quantify isoform ratios for annotated alternative splicing events, and alternative splicing of constitutive junctions and retention of constitutive introns was quantified with junction reads as previously described (Hubert et al. 2013). All analyses were restricted to splicing events with at least 20 relevant reads (reads supporting either or both isoforms) that were alternatively spliced in our data. Events were defined as differentially spliced between two samples if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) at least 20 relevant reads in both samples; (2) a change in isoform ratio of at least 10%; and (3) a Bayes factor ≥ 2.5 (AML data) or 5 (K562 data). Because the AML data had approximately twofold lower read coverage than the K562 data, we reduced the Bayes factor by a factor of two to compensate for the loss in statistical power. Wagenmakers’ framework (Wagenmakers et al. 2010) was used to compute Bayes factors for differences in isoform ratios between samples. A description of the isoform-specific PCR used for Supplemental Figure S5 is given in Supplemental Methods. To identify splicing events that were differentially spliced in AML S34 samples versus WT samples (Supplemental File S1), we used the Mann-Whitney U test and required P < 0.01. To identify splicing events that were differentially spliced in each AML sample with a U2AF1 mutation (Fig. 4A; Supplemental Fig. S6), each U2AF1 mutant sample was compared to an average U2AF1 WT sample. The average U2AF1 WT sample was created by averaging isoform ratios over all 162 U2AF1 WT samples.  Cluster analysis, sequence logos, and gene ontology enrichment  To perform the cluster analysis of AML transcriptomes (Fig. 1C) and K562 cells (Fig. 2C), we identified cassette exons that displayed changes in isoform ratios ≥ 10% across the samples and then further restricted to cassette exons with at least 100 informative reads across all samples. An informative read is defined as a RNA-seq read that supports either isoform, but not both. We created a similarity matrix using the Pearson correlation computed from the z-score normalized cassette exon inclusion values and clustered the samples using Ward’s method. Sequence logos were created with v1.26.0 of the seqLogo package in Bioconductor (Gentleman et al. 2004). Gene ontology analysis was performed with GOseq (Young et al. 2010) and is described further in Supplemental Methods.  Western blotting  Protein lysates from K562 cells pellets were generated by resuspension in RIPA buffer and protease inhibitor along with sonication. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay. Ten micrograms of protein was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody 1:1000 anti-U2AF1 (Bethyl Laboratories, catalog no. A302-080A), anti-FLAG (Thermo, catalog no. MA1-91878), anti-Histone H3 (Abcam, catalog no. ab1791), or anti-alpha-tubulin (Sigma, catalog no. T9026) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed with TBS containing 0.005% Tween 20 and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.  Minigenes  An insert containing the ATR genomic locus (Chr 3: 142168344–142172070) or EPB49 genomic locus (Chr 8: 21938036–21938724) was cloned into the EcoRV site of pUB6/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen) by Gibson assembly cloning (NEB). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate different nucleotides at the −3 position of the 3′ splice site. Details of minigene transfection and real-time PCR are specified in Supplemental Methods.  In vitro splicing  A pre-mRNA substrate transcribed from the AdML derivative HMS388 was used in all splicing reactions (Jurica et al. 2002; Reichert et al. 2002). T7 runoff transcription was used to generate G(5′)ppp(5′)G-capped radiolabeled pre-mRNA using UTP [α-32P], and K562 nuclear extracts were isolated following a published protocol (Folco et al. 2012) with a minor modification. Pre-mRNA substrates were incubated in standard splicing conditions, and RNA species were separated in a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized using a phosphoimager (full details in Supplemental Methods). For quantification in Figure 5, each species was normalized by subtracting the background and then dividing by the number of uracil nucleotides in that species. The percentage of the second step products was calculated by dividing the second step species (spliced mRNA and lariat intron) by the total of all species in the lane.  Protein structure prediction  Models of U2AF1 (residues 9–174) in complex with a RNA fragment extending from the 3′ splice site positions −4 to +3 were built by combining template-based modeling, fragment assembly methods, and all-atom refinement. Models were built using the software package Rosetta (Leaver-Fay et al. 2011) with template coordinate data taken from the UHM:ULM complex structure (Kielkopf et al. 2001) (PDB ID 1jmt: residues A/46–143) and the TIS11d:RNA complex structure (Hudson et al. 2004) (PDB ID 1rgo: U2AF1 residues 16–37 mapped to A/195–216; residues 155–174 mapped to A/159–179; RNA positions −4 to −1 mapped to D/1–4; RNA positions +1 to +3 mapped to D/7–9). The remainder of the modeled region (residues 9–15, 38–45, and 144–154) was built using fragment assembly (with templated regions held internally fixed) in a low-resolution representation (backbone heavy atoms and side chain centroids) and force field. The fragment assembly simulation consisted of 6000 fragment-replacement trials, for which fragments of size 6 (trials 1–3000), 3 (trials 3001–5000), and 1 (trials 5001–6000) were used. The RNA was modeled in two pieces, one anchored in the N-terminal zinc finger and the other in the C-terminal zinc finger, with docking geometries taken from the TIS11d:RNA complex. A pseudo-energy term favoring chain closure was added to the potential function to reward closure of the chain break between the RNA fragments. The fragment assembly simulation was followed by all-atom refinement during which all side chains as well as the nontemplated protein backbone and the RNA were flexible. Roughly 100,000 independent model building simulations were conducted, each with a different random number seed and using a randomly selected member of the 1rgo NMR ensemble as a template. Low-energy final models were clustered to identify frequently sampled conformations (the model depicted in Fig. 5A was the center of the largest cluster). We explored a range of possible alignments of the splice site RNA within the complex, with the final model selected on the basis of all-atom energies, RNA chain closure, manual inspection, and known sequence features of the 3′ splice site motif. We previously identified missense mutations in the U2AF1 splicing factor affecting codons S34 (S34F and S34Y) or Q157 (Q157R and Q157P) in 11% of patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Although the role of U2AF1 as an accessory factor in the U2 snRNP is well established, it is not yet clear how mutations affect splicing or contribute to MDS pathophysiology. We analyzed splice junctions in RNA-seq data generated from transfected CD34+ hematopoietic cells and found significant differences in the abundance of known and novel junctions in samples expressing mutant U2AF1 (S34F). For selected transcripts, splicing alterations detected by RNA-seq were confirmed by analysis of primary de novo MDS patient samples. These effects were not due to impaired U2AF1 (S34F) localization as it co-localized normally with U2AF2 within nuclear speckles. We further found evidence in the RNA-seq data for decreased affinity of U2AF1 (S34F) for uridine (relative to cytidine) at the e-3 position immediately upstream of the splice acceptor site and corroborated this finding using affinity binding assays. These data suggest that the S34F mutation alters U2AF1 function in the context of specific RNA sequences, leading to aberrant alternative splicing of target genes, some of which may be relevant for MDS pathogenesis.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Recent studies have revealed that core spliceosome components are targets of recurrent mutation in a variety of hematopoietic malignancies. Splicing factor mutations, particularly in SF3B1, U2AF1 and SRSF2, are present in approximately 50% of MDS cases, making them the most common class of mutations in this disease.1-6 These mutations are also common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), occurring with a frequency of ~14%,7 and SF3B1 is the second most frequently mutated gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.8-10  U2AF1 encodes the 35 kDa auxiliary factor for the U2 pre-mRNA splicing complex and recognizes the 3’ AG dinucleotide at the splice acceptor site in a pre-mRNA intron.11, 12 U2AF1 has four domains: a U2AF homology motif (UHM), two zinc finger (ZnF) domains, and an arginine-serine (RS) domain.13 U2AF1 heterodimerizes with U2AF2 through its UHM domain,13,14 and U2AF2 in turn binds the pre-mRNA as a complex with SF1.15 This U2AF1 interaction leads to the recruitment and stabilization of U2AF binding to degenerate pre-mRNA polypyrimidine (Py) tracts.16 U2AF1 also interacts directly with serine-arginine (SR) splice factors SRSF1 and SRSF2,17 and interacts either directly or indirectly with other factors during spliceosome assembly.18  11 distinct mutations have been reported in U2AF1, including 9 missense mutations (resulting in A26V, S34F/Y, R35L, R156H/Q, Q157P/R, or G213A substitutions) and 2 frame- shift mutations (affecting codons Q157 or E159).1, 2, 6, 19-22 Most of these mutations occur within the two ZnF domains of U2AF1, with S34 and Q157 being the most commonly mutated residues. In our previous analysis in MDS, the S34F substitution was the most common (66.7%), followed by Q157P (16.7%), S34Y (11%) and Q157R (5.6%) out of 18 total U2AF1 mutations.1, 22  We previously reported that mutant U2AF1 (S34F) causes increased exon skipping and cryptic/alternative splice site utilization in minigene assays.1 In addition, other groups have observed differential splicing resulting from exon inclusion and skipping in AML patient samples with S34F (n=4) or S34Y (n=2) mutations.20 Overexpression of U2AF1 (S34F) suppresses growth and proliferation, and increases the rate of apoptosis in HeLa cells in vitro. Hematopoietic stem cells (CD34−KSL) expressing the S34F, Q157P or Q157R mutations have reduced capability to reconstitute recipient mouse bone marrow.2 Collectively, these studies provide evidence that the S34F mutation affects not only U2AF1 function but may also alter hematopoiesis.  While there have been attempts to understand the global impact of the S34F mutant on splicing and gene expression using transcriptome sequencing (i.e., RNA-seq), the genetic heterogeneity of primary MDS and AML poses challenges for discovery of target genes and no consistently dysregulated genes have been reported. It is also unclear what role the ZnF domains play and whether mutations in the S34 and Q157 residues possibly alter U2AF1 interactions with RNA or result in mis-localization.  We performed transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on CD34+ hematopoietic cells to assess the global impact of mutant U2AF1 on splicing and gene expression. We found that U2AF1 (S34F) affects pre-mRNA splicing of a large number of target genes, some of which are known oncogenic drivers, and preferentially skips splice acceptor sites immediately adjacent to uridine at the −3 position. We also determined the effect of the S34F substitution on sub-cellular localization and on the RNA binding specificity of U2AF1 for a representative affected splice site and U and C-variants at the e-3 position. Finally, we examined the effect of a spectrum of U2AF1 mutations on splicing activity.  Go to: METHODS RNA sequencing  Human hematopoietic mononuclear cells (MNCs) were separated from cord blood using density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll Paque, GE Healthcare). CD34+ cells were isolated from MNCs using the CD34 MicroBead kit (Miltenyi Biotec) on an autoMACs magnetic separator. These cells were cultured in SFEMII media (Stemcell Technologies) supplemented with IL-3, SCF, FLT-3 and TPO cytokines. WT and S34F U2AF1 cDNAs were generated, as previously described,1 and then cloned into pcDNA3.1-Ires-GFP (PIG) to create PIG-U2AF1 (WT or S34F). CD34+ cells then were transfected with PIG-U2AF1 (WT or S34F) using the Nucleofector Kit for Human CD34+ Cells (Lonza). GFP+CD34+ cells were sorted 24 hours later, followed by RNA extraction using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Ribosomal RNA was depleted (Ribozero, Epicenter), followed by cDNA preparation and Illumina library production. Sequencing was performed on the HiSeq2000 platform (Illumina). Bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data is described in the supplementary material.  RNA-seq validation  RT-PCR followed by gel electrophoresis was carried out using RNA isolated from independent CD34+ samples, transfected and purified as described above. RNA extraction and cDNA preparation from patient samples has been previously described.1 Primers used for validation can be found in Supplementary Table 5 and were designed to span the splice junction such that both the canonical and alternatively spliced isoforms are amplified. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to quantify mRNA expression was performed using Taqman 2X Universal mix on the 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Bioscience) and analyzed using the relative quantification of comparative CT method.  RNA affinities of purified U2AF1 protein complexes  Fluorescence anisotropy changes were monitored during titration of fluorescein-labeled RNAs with purified protein complexes comprising U2AF2 (residues 85-471 at the C-terminus of NCBI RefSeq NP_001012496, isoform b), SF1 (residues 1-255 of NCBI RefSeq NP_004621) with either WT U2AF1 (residues 1-193 of NCBI RefSeq NP_006749) or the S34F mutant. Proteins were full-length with the exception of the nonspecific U2AF RS domains, and for SF1, a proline-rich C-terminal domain. The protein complex purification is explained in supplementary material. The 5’-labeled fluorescein RNAs (sequences DEK-“skipped”(UAG): 5’- UAAGAAAUACUAAAUUAAUUUCUAG AAAAGAGUCUCA; DEK-“skipped”-CAG: 5’- UAAGAAAUACUAAAUUAAUUUCCAG AAAAGAGUCUCA; DEK-“spliced”(CAG) 5’- AAUUGUGAUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCAG GAAAGGGGCAGA; DEK-“spliced”-UAG: 5’- AAUUGUGAUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCAG GAAAGGGGCAGA; the three nucleotides preceding 3’ splice site junction are underlined) were synthesized and purified (ThermoScientific Dharmacon). Fluorescence anisotropy changes were measured at 520 nm following excitation at 490 nm using a Fluoromax-3 (Horiba Ltd.) equipped with microcuvette (Starna Cells Inc.). An RNA stock (0.75 mM) was diluted to 25 nM and the protein complex stocks (20 μM) were diluted to the final concentrations shown in Supplementary Figure 5B. The protein and RNA buffer composition for the binding experiments was 25 mM HEPES pH 6.8, 150 mM NaCl, 25 μM ZnCl2 and 1 mM TCEP. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants were fit, as previously described.23  Minigene constructs and transfection  To create the MIG (MND Ires GFP)-U2AF1-Flag plasmid, U2AF1-Flag cDNA was amplified from the p3X-Flag-U2AF1 plasmid (obtained from the Kinji Ohno laboratory, Nagoya, Japan) and cloned into the MND-Ires-GFP (MIG) vector.24 The S34F, S34Y, S34F/Q157R, Q157R and Q157P mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Life Technologies) using the WT MIG-U2AF1-Flag construct as a template. 293T cells were co-transfected with each MIG-U2AF1-Flag expression plasmid described above and either the GH1 or FMR1 minigene reporter constructs described previously.1, 25 GFP+ cells were sorted 48 hours later, followed by RNA extraction and RT-PCR as previously described.1 Amplicons were visualized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified by densitometry (ImageJ). Three independent experiments were performed for each assay and analyzed using the Student’s t-test. Lysates were made from transfected 293T cells and immunoblotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-U2AF1 antibody (Abcam) to confirm over-expression.  Sub-cellular localization  Constructs containing the S34F mutant allele were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of p3X-Flag-U2AF1. 293T cells were transfected with either p3X- Flag-U2AF1 (WT) or p3X-Flag-U2AF1 (S34F). 24 hours later, the cells were fixed in 2-4% formaldehyde-PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and then washed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% (wt/vol) Triton X-100/PBS for 10 minutes and blocked with 1% goat serum/0.3%TritonX-100/PBS for 1 hour. The following primary antibodies were used for fluorescence microscopy: mouse monoclonal antibodies against Smith Antigen snRNP family (Y12; Abcam) or U2AF2 (Sigma), and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-mouse (Sigma) as a secondary antibody. Monoclonal anti-Flag M2-FITC (Sigma) used to detect Flag-tagged U2AF1 and TOPRO (Life Technologies) used as a nuclear counterstain. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with a 63X, 1.4 numerical aperture, Zeiss Plan Apochromat oil objective at 2.5 zoom and captured using Zeiss LSM510 software.  Go to: RESULTS The S34F mutation affects pre-mRNA splicing  We transfected primary human CD34+ hematopoietic cells with U2AF1 (either WT or the S34F mutant) and performed RNA-seq to comprehensively determine the effects of the S34F mutant on pre-mRNA splicing and gene expression. We isolated cells 24 hours after transfection in order to identify immediate splicing changes induced by mutant U2AF1, while minimizing alterations that may occur with prolonged time in culture or as a consequence of secondary adaptations to altered splicing. Total reads of the raw sequence output ranged from 300 to 500 million per sample (Supplementary Figure 1A). Unique reads mappable to the human transcriptome were similar across all samples except for one outlier (S34F sample in replicate R3), whose replicate was excluded from further analysis (Supplementary Figure 1B). The distribution of mapped bases (coding, untranslated (UTR), intergenic, intronic and ribosomal bases) was similar for all 8 samples, with coding and UTR comprising 60-80% of the bases (Supplementary Figure 1C). As expected, reads mapped to U2AF1 exon 2 demonstrated a G>A substitution only in cells transfected with the mutant cDNA (Supplementary Figure 1D). In these samples, mutant U2AF1 represented 85- 97% of total U2AF1 expression, after normalizing for total mapped reads in each sample. Subsequent analyses capitalize on the paired experimental design (i.e., the same pool of CD34+ cells transfected with either WT or mutant U2AF1, repeated in 3 biological replicates). The ratio of total U2AF1 expression (measured by FPKM) between mutant and WT samples were consistent across pairs (5.78, 2.49, 3.66 for R1, R2, and R4, respectively).  Though unsupervised clustering using adjusted expression levels (see Supplementary Methods) of 17,390 genes segregated samples based on genotype (mutant vs WT samples; Supplementary Figure 2A), lengths of dendrogram branches connecting samples within a genotype are similar to lengths of branches connecting samples of different genotypes. This indicates that the samples do not strongly cluster by genotype and that there is no strong, acute, global, gene-level effect induced by U2AF1 (S34F). To focus on those relatively few genes that were affected by U2AF1 (S34F), we applied edgeR, a statistical approach based on total counts of reads mapped to a gene that incorporates the experiment's paired design for improved power. This revealed that 1,296 genes were differentially expressed between paired WT U2AF1 and U2AF1 (S34F) samples (FDR < 5%). Hierarchical clustering of these differentially expressed genes (supervised at the 5% FDR cutoff) segregated mutant and WT samples, as expected (Supplementary Figure 2B).  We next analyzed junction-level expression (using edgeR and total reads mapped to a junction) to assess the effect of U2AF1 (S34F) on global splicing activity. We discovered that mutant U2AF1 alters pre-mRNA splicing of expressed junctions in 6% (959/15,687, FDR<5%) of genes (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 3A-B and Supplementary Table 2). Of the 959 genes alternatively spliced junctions, 241 (FDR<5%) were also differentially expressed at the gene level in S34F samples compared to WT (Supplementary Figure 3B and Supplementary Table 2). These expression differences involved known splice junctions (present in Ensembl, release 67), and novel junctions resulting from: 1) known splice acceptor and donor sites (novel junction involving a donor and acceptor that are individually present in Ensembl transcripts, but which have not been observed in combination), 2) known splice acceptor and novel (not present in Ensembl) splice donor sites, 3) novel splice acceptor and known splice donor sites, or 4) novel splice acceptor and donor sites (Supplementary Figure 3A). Both the known and novel junctions reflected an increase or decrease in mRNA isoforms due to alternative splicing, including exon skipping, alternative 3’ or 5’ splice site usage, and events that involved usage of both the alternative 5’ and 3’ splice sites (Supplementary Figure 3C; Supplementary Table 2). Next, we identified altered junctions differing by at least 4-fold in mutant vs. WT expressing samples. We discovered significant differences in the abundance of 544 out 202,401 total junctions (FDR<5%, | log2(fold change) | > 2) in cells expressing U2AF1 (S34F), compared with WT [known splice junctions (280/170,321; 0.16%); novel splice junctions (264/31,180; 0.85%)] (Figure 1A-D; Supplementary Table 2). Reads from novel junctions resulting from both novel acceptor and donor sites were not analyzed further.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Overexpression of U2AF1 (S34F) alters the distribution of known and novel splice junctions We selected 24 junctions with higher expression (FDR<5%; | log2(fold change) | >2) in U2AF1 (S34F) samples for validation in independently prepared CD34+ cells. Of these, we validated 10/20 known junctions (Figure 2A-B and Supplementary Figure 4A-C, left panels) and 4/4 novel junctions (Supplementary Figure 4D). 10 of the validated changes were further tested in primary clinical samples [n=6 MDS bone marrow samples with U2AF1 (S34F) vs. n=6 MDS controls with no U2AF1 splicing mutations] and 5 were confirmed, including junctions resulting from alternative splicing due to exon skipping in DEK and SMN1 and 3’ alternative site usage in SERPIN8B, KIAA1033, and IFI44 (Figure 2A-B and Supplementary Figure 4A-B, right panels). As further independent validation of the 544 junctions, we assessed their differential expression between 6 S34(F/Y) U2AF1 mutant AML patient samples and 108 control AML samples in publically-available TCGA RNA-seq data.26 Other than the S34 variants in the 6 mutant samples, none of the samples had nucleotide mutations or copy number alternations in U2AF1 or any of 272 other splicing factors. 10 junctions had statistically significant (FDR < 5%) dysregulation with concordant fold change, i.e., in the same direction as detected in CD34+ cells (p-value < 10−3; Supplementary Table 3).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Exon skipping and alternative splice site usage increased in U2AF1 (S34F) mutant samples It has been shown previously that U2AF1 is not required for splicing of introns containing strong Py tracts,27 but it is important for splicing of introns that contain short or weak Py tracts.11, 28, 29 To determine whether there were sequence differences in the 3’ splice sites of junctions affected by U2AF1 (S34F), we analyzed sequences flanking (from −20 to +3 bps) the 3’ AG dinucleotide (the binding site for U2AF1). We focused on exon skipping and alternative 3’ site usage events, as these represent the majority of dysregulated events (Supplementary Figure 3C). An exon-skipping event was defined as skipping of a single cassette exon (Figure 3A). An alternative 3’ usage event resulted in partial loss of an exon due to skipping of the canonical junction and usage of a single alternative 3’ splice site down-stream of the canonical 3’ splice site (Figure 3B). When we analyzed the 3’ splice sites of skipped exons, we found that there was a high frequency of uridine (U) at position e-3 in exons that were skipped more by U2AF1 (S34F) compared to those skipped more in WT [S34F>WT: 81/111 (73%); WT>S34F: 10/68 (15%); p=8.5x10−15] (Figure 3A), consistent with previously reported findings.20, 30 The 3’ canonical junctions skipped more by U2AF1 (S34F) also had a higher frequency of U at position e-3 [S34F>WT: 64/101 (63%); WT>S34F: 22/101 (22%); p=3.7x10−9] (Figure 3B, left panel), and resulted in increased 3’ alternative cryptic splice site usage, consistent with a recent report.30 We then analyzed the 3’ alternative cryptic splice site to determine whether there was a sequence preference for the S34F mutant. As seen with skipped exons, there was a higher frequency of uridine (U) at the e-3 position of the skipped junctions expressed more in U2AF1 (S34F) compared to WT [71/101 (70%); WT>S34F: 38/101 (38%); p=5.2x10−6] (Figure 3B, right panel). No other apparent differences in base preferences were noted in the Py tract preceding the 3’ AG dinucleotide of the skipped exons or junctions. As a control, we analyzed junctions that showed no evidence for differential expression by U2AF1 (S34F) [ | log2(fold change) | < 0.001] (Figure 3C). We did not observe any differences in sequences at the 5’ splice site of skipped exons, or at 5’ sites of exons with alternative 5’ or 3’ splice sites (Supplementary Figure 3D and data not shown), consistent with the known activity of U2AF1 which is restricted to 3’ splice sites. Collectively, these data suggest that the 3’ splice sites that are more frequently skipped by U2AF1 (S34F) are enriched for U at e-3, while alternative sites utilized more frequently by the mutant are enriched for C at e-3. We examined junctions that were validated in patient samples and found that all validated junctions (5/5) had U at position e-3 at skipped junctions, suggesting that this consensus sequence enriches for true positive junctions that are preferentially skipped by U2AF1 (S34F) (Supplementary Table 4).  Figure 3 Figure 3 The U2AF1 (S34F) mutant recognizes the uridine at position e-3 of the 3’ splice site less frequently The S34F mutation alters the affinity of pre-mRNA to U2AF1  The enhanced exon skipping and alternative 3’ splice site usage seen with the U2AF1 (S34F) mutant could be due to altered binding of U2AF1 to canonical 3’ AG (acceptor site). To explore this further, we compared the RNA affinities of WT and S34F-mutant U2AF1 for splice sites from a representative affected transcript, the DEK oncogene, where a U at position e-3 (i.e., UAG) was skipped in favor of splicing into a CAG splice site. The DEK1-“skipped” RNA oligo comprised the intron/exon region of the splice acceptor site of exon 3 (skipped by S34F mutant U2AF1) whereas the DEK- “spliced” RNA oligo comprised the downstream intron/exon 4 sequence that is preferentially spliced into by the mutant (Figure 4A). To better emulate the context of the assembling spliceosome, we used ternary complexes of either wild-type U2AF1 (residues 1-193) or the S34F mutant with accessory protein subunits for the early stage of 3’ splice site recognition: U2AF2 (residues 85-471 at the C-terminus) and SF1 (residues 1-255) (Figure 4B, Supplementary Figure 5A). Both of the U2AF proteins were full length with the exception of the nonspecific RS domains. For SF1, a C-terminal proline-rich domain thought to interact with 5’ splice site subunits was truncated. The RNA oligos were fluorescein-labeled and the RNA affinities were determined from anisotropy changes during titration with the purified protein complexes (Supplementary Figure 5B). Consistent with S34F-dependent skipping of the corresponding DEK splice site, the DEK-“skipped” RNA oligo bound less avidly to mutant U2AF1 (S34F) compared with WT (Figure 4C). The nearly identical binding of mutant or WT U2AF1 to the DEK-“spliced” RNA oligo also was consistent with the similar splicing of the downstream splice site in normal and mutant U2AF1 samples.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Comparison of the WT and S34F U2AF1 affinities for splice sites from a representative affected transcript, the DEK oncogene Based on the preferential, S34F-dependent skipping of junctions with U at position e-3 and splicing of junctions with C at position e-3 in the presence of mutant U2AF1 (S34F), we next tested the RNA sequence discrimination of the WT and S34F mutant protein complexes for the C or U e-3 variants of the DEK splice sites (Figure 4A). Alteration of the UAG in the skipped DEK sequence to CAG (DEK-“skipped”-CAG, Figure 4A) increased the affinity for both the U2AF1 protein complexes and to a significantly greater extent for the S34F-mutant (2-fold and 9-fold higher affinity for the WT and S34F proteins, respectively) (Figure 4C). Conversely, alteration of the CAG in the downstream, spliced DEK sequence to UAG (DEK-“spliced”-UAG, Figure 4A) decreased the affinity for both the U2AF1 protein complexes with a significantly greater penalty for the S34F mutant (factors of 2 and 6 affinity decrease for the WT and S34F proteins, respectively) (Figure 4C). These data demonstrate that the S34F mutation alters the sequence specificity of the ternary U2AF1 complex in favor of binding splice sites comprising C at e-3 and discriminates against splice sites comprising U at the e-3 position.  The S34F mutation does not affect U2AF1 localization within nuclear speckles  U2AF1 is diffusely distributed in the nucleoplasm and localizes within the nuclear speckles (sites of spliceosome assembly).31, 32 Using fluorescence immunocytochemistry on U2AF1-Flag (WT or S34F) transfected 293T cells, we found that U2AF1 (S34F) localized normally (Supplementary Figure 6A). Furthermore, U2AF1 (S34F) co-localized with U2AF2 and Smith Antigen family of snRNP proteins (Y12 antibody) in a similar pattern as WT (Supplementary Figure 6B), suggesting that the altered splicing activity of U2AF1 (S34F) was not due to abnormal trafficking of the mutant protein.  Specific effects of U2AF1 mutations in alternative splicing  Apart from the S34F substitution, there are 10 other reported somatic mutations in U2AF1 that may affect its function. Since mutations at codons S34 and Q157 are the most common, we utilized GH1 and FMR1 minigenes1, 25 to determine the effect of substitutions at these positions on splicing activity. The GH1 or FMR1 minigene was transiently co-transfected with either MND-IRES-GFP (MIG; empty vector) or MIG-U2AF1-Flag (WT, S34F, S34Y, S34F/Q157R, Q157R or Q157P alleles) into 293T cells. Over-expression was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure 5A; Supplementary Figure 7A) and Western blot analysis (Figure 5B; Supplementary Figure 7B). Isoform a represents the canonical isoform, and isoforms b and c (if present) are the alternatively spliced isoforms. In GH1, isoform b results from exon skipping and in FMR1 isoforms b and c result from alternative 3’ splice site usage. U2AF1 (S34F) yielded the most significant increase in alternative splicing activity for both GH1 and FMR1 (Figure 5C and D, respectively), consistent with previously published results.1 U2AF1 (S34Y) modestly enhanced relative expression of the alternative isoforms for both minigenes. Conversely, there was a reduction in relative expression of the alternative isoforms for both minigenes in cells expressing the Q157R (Figure 5C and D) and Q157P mutations (Supplementary Figure 7C and D). In cells expressing the S34F/Q157R double mutant (in which both the mutant S34F and Q157R occur on one allele, discovered in one patient with MDS1), GH1 splicing was indistinguishable from WT (Figure 5C) and there was a modest reduction in the relative expression of the alternative isoform of FMR1 (Figure 5D). Next, we examined the effects of different U2AF1 mutations on the splicing of endogenous DEK. Exon skipping in endogenous DEK was increased in 293T samples expressing S34F/Y, S34F/Q157R and Q157R mutants relative to WT (Figure 5E). As observed with the GH1 and FMR1 minigenes, the S34F mutant caused the most robust increase in alternative isoform b expression. However, unlike the GH1 and FMR1 minigenes, expression of the Q157R mutant resulted in increased alternative isoform splicing compared to WT expressing cells for DEK. Interestingly, analysis of TCGA AML RNA-seq data demonstrated that junctions differentially expressed in a sample with Q157P mutant U2AF1 vs. WT U2AF1 (| log2(fold change) | >1) do not share the signature at flanking sequences (C>U at e-3) that we detected in junctions differentially spliced by S34F U2AF1 (FDR <5%; Supplementary Figure 8). These results provide evidence that splicing is altered in a mutation-specific manner, but variable between specific junctions tested, with the most potent effects caused by U2AF1 (S34F) mutant.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Recurrent missense mutations in U2AF1 have specific effects on alternative splicing Go to: DISCUSSION Recent discoveries of recurrent mutations in core components of the pre-mRNA splicing complex highlight the potential importance of these genes in myelodysplastic syndromes. In this study, we used RNA-seq to detect global changes in splicing activity and isoform expression and discovered differences in expression of known and novel splice junctions. Our study is the first to analyze the impact of a mutant splicing factor on the transcriptome in a controlled genetic background in primary hematopoietic cells. So a consistent signature has not been defined for genes whose splicing is clearly affected by U2AF1 (S34F). Published results are conflicting, with one study reporting ~130 unspliced exons due to intron retention in mutant U2AF1-transfected HeLa cells2 while another (utilizing patient samples with a spectrum of splicing mutations) found no evidence for genome-wide intron retention, although these mutations did perturb TET2 splicing.6 Analysis of TCGA AML RNA-seq data revealed a predominance of exon skipping in 35 exons dysregulated by U2AF1 (S34F).20 The affected genes were involved in mitosis and RNA processing. Our results include a substantially larger number of alternative splicing events that were impacted by U2AF1 (S34F). Of the 35 genes that had significant exon skipping or retention in the data set from Pryzchodzen, et al.,20 only one gene (STRAP) overlaps with our results. When we validated the 544 junctions that were differential expressed in our RNA-seq data with the TCGA RNA-seq data, we found 10 genes that overlapped with our results, including STRAP and CCT6A. Although the DEK junction was not among these, the same DEK junction did have a p-value of 0.06 and concordant fold change in the TCGA data. Several characteristics of our experimental design may explain these largely non-overlapping results, including: (1) the use of CD34+ cells which have less genetic heterogeneity, compared to primary patient samples, (2) use of paired samples (S34F vs. WT), minimizing variability within biological replicates, and (3) differences in analytical approaches.  We found a higher frequency of uridine at the e-3 nucleotide in 3’ splice junctions that were skipped more often in U2AF1 (S34F) samples, including both exon skipping events and alternative 3’ splice site usage. These findings confirm previous observations related to exon skipping and alternative splice site usage.20, 30 This implies that there is selective or altered U2AF1 (S34F) binding to pre-mRNA at these junctions, possibly resulting from an increased affinity of U2AF1 (S34F) for C over U, relative to WT U2AF1, which we corroborated experimentally by determining the affinities of purified U2AF2/U2AF1 (WT or S34F) heterodimers for the affected splice sites of a representative example, DEK. Consistent with the S34F-affected splice site junctions, the S34F mutation selectively inhibited binding of the mutant U2AF1 complexes to the DEK splice site variants comprising U at the e-3 position. Conversely, substitution with a C at this position significantly increased U2AF1 (S34F) binding.  While it is not known which U2AF1 domain or domains directly bind RNA, the altered RNA binding affinity of the S34F mutant U2AF1 suggests that the ZnF domains are critical. The S34F mutation is in the first of these domains. In S. pombe, substitution of highly conserved cysteine residues (C18 and C149) to alanine of the ZnF domains results in lethality, and an RNA three-hybrid screen showed that these two ZnF domains are independently required for RNA binding of the U2AF heterodimer in yeast.33 Furthermore, the U2AF1 ZnF domains are predicted to be structurally similar to the murine and human ZFP36 family (both CX8CX5CX3H zinc fingers), which are known to bind RNA,34, 35 and our data suggest that the ZnF1 domain of U2AF1 may have this function. Rather than simply ablating function, the capacity of the S34F mutation to specifically discriminate between U and C at the e-3 position of the splice site junction implicates this residue in hydrogen bonds with the N3 or O4 positions of the pyrimidine base.  While mutant U2AF1 alters pre-mRNA splicing, the overall change in the total number of known and novel junctions is minimal, affecting (at an FDR <5%) fewer than 1% (1,594/201,501) of expressed junctions in 6% of analyzed genes. In addition, the proportion of isoforms induced by U2AF1 (S34F) expression is a small fraction of the total transcript for those genes. Collectively, these findings raise the possibility that disease pathogenesis induced by mutant U2AF1 may also be mediated through non-pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms that should be explored in future studies.  Finally, we discovered that the S34 and Q157 U2AF1 mutations have different effects on pre-mRNA splicing using GH1 and FMR1 minigenes. We detected an increase in relative expression of the alternative isoforms for both minigenes with S34 mutants, and a decrease in relative expression of these isoforms with Q157 mutants relative to WT, indicating that these mutations affect U2AF1-dependent splicing function differently depending on their location and the reporter junctions being queried (S34; ZnF1 and Q157; ZnF2). In fact, when splicing of endogenous DEK was analyzed following expression of U2AF1 (Q157R), a similar but less robust increase in alternative splicing was observed as seen with expression of U2AF1 (S34F). Junction analysis of one Q157P sample in the TCGA AML RNA-seq data adds credence to these findings. The differentially expressed junctions in this Q157P sample did not share the same signature at flanking sequences that were detected in junctions differentially spliced by S34F U2AF1 (C>U at e-3). These results suggest that there are differences in alternative splicing induced by S34F vs. Q157R/P mutations, but highlight the need for an unbiased transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) comparing expression of U2AF1 S34F vs. Q157R/P in order to elucidate the full extent of these similarities and differences. The splicing alterations detected with specific U2AF1 mutants may be shared by other splicing factors with recurrent mutations in myeloid neoplasms such as SF3B1, ZRSR2, SRSF2 and SF1 and common changes could serve as novel therapeutic targets across these diseases. Identifying important potential target genes that are affected by U2AF1 mutants is necessary for further understanding of their role in MDS and other cancers.  
1369||The serine–threonine kinase AKT regulates proliferation and survival by phosphorylating a network of protein substrates. In this study, we describe a kinase-independent function of AKT. In cancer cells harboring gain-of-function alterations in MET, HER2, or Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K), catalytically inactive AKT (K179M) protected from drug induced cell death in a PH-domain dependent manner. An AKT kinase domain mutant found in human melanoma (G161V) lacked enzymatic activity in vitro and in AKT1/AKT2 double knockout cells, but promoted growth factor independent survival of primary human melanocytes. ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors failed to block the kinase-independent function of AKT, a liability that limits their effectiveness compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors. Our results broaden the current view of AKT function and have important implications for the development of AKT inhibitors for cancer.  DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03751.001  Research organism: human, mouse Go to: eLife digest To maintain a healthy body, the ability of our cells to survive and divide is normally strictly controlled. If any cells manage to escape these restrictions, they may rapidly divide and form tumors, which can lead to cancer.  A protein called AKT can encourage cells to survive and divide, and in healthy cells it is only allowed to be active at specific times. However, in many cancer cells, the genes that make and control AKT activity can be altered by mutations, which can result in AKT being active at the wrong times.  Part of the AKT protein acts as an enzyme called a kinase and adds chemical groups called phosphates to other proteins. The phosphate groups can activate or deactivate these proteins to control cell survival and cell division. However, there are other sections to the AKT protein and it is not clear how they are involved in this protein's activity.  In this study, Vivanco et al. show that AKT has another role in cell survival that does not depend on its kinase. The experiments show that even when the kinase part of the protein is missing, AKT can help cancer cells to survive drug treatments and external conditions that would normally kill them. This role requires another section of the protein called the PH-domain.  There are several chemicals—called inhibitors—that can stop AKT from working properly, and they have the potential to be used to treat some types of cancer. These inhibitors work in different ways: some were able to block the activity of the kinase, but others inhibited AKT by binding to other parts of the protein. Therefore, to develop AKT inhibitors into effective drugs, it will be important to know precisely what role the protein plays in different types of cancers.  DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03751.002  Go to: Introduction The serine–threonine kinase AKT is a non-receptor kinase that plays critical roles in growth and metabolism (Pearce et al., 2010). AKT is aberrantly activated in many human cancers, usually due to mutations in upstream components of the Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway. AKT signaling is required for tumor maintenance in certain genetic contexts, as has been shown for some cancer cell lines harboring PI3K mutations or amplification of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase (She et al., 2008). Encouraged by these results, several ATP-competitive and allosteric AKT inhibitors have been identified (Engelman, 2009), but optimal strategies for the clinical development of these agents are currently unknown.  Go to: Results To address this question, we compared the activity of the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206 (Hirai et al., 2010) with the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors GSK690693 (Heerding et al., 2008; Rhodes et al., 2008) and GDC0068 (Lin et al., 2013). Each of these AKT inhibitors dose dependently inhibited AKT kinase activity in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line EBC1 as determined by phosphorylation of three AKT substrates (PRAS40, GSK3β, and BAD) in whole-cell lysates (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Consistent with previous reports (Okuzumi et al., 2009), the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors induced hyper-phosphorylation of AKT at the two regulatory phosphorylation sites threonine 308 and serine 473. When we compared the ability of the AKT inhibitors to induce cell death using a trypan blue exclusion assay, we observed significantly greater cell death induction by the allosteric inhibitor MK2206 compared to the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors GSK690693 (Figure 1B—source data 1) and GDC0068 (Figure 1C—source data 1) despite less complete inhibition of AKT substrate phosphorylation at these drug concentrations (Figure 1A).  Figure 1. Figure 1. Differential sensitivity of human cancer cells to different classes of AKT inhibitors. We had selected EBC1 lung cancer cells for our initial studies because they harbor amplification of MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates critical oncogenic signals through the PI3K/AKT axis (Gherardi et al., 2012). To test whether other MET-amplified human cancer cells show a similar drug response pattern, we extended our experiments to MET-amplified H1993 and H1648 NSCLC cell lines and GTL-16 gastric cancer cells. MK2206 again induced significantly more cell death than GSK690693 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 1—source data 1). In cell lines with other PI3K pathway alterations previously associated with ‘AKT-dependence’ (She et al., 2008), we also found that MK2006 induced significantly more cell death than ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors. These cell lines included breast cancer cells with HER2 amplification and/or PIK3CA-mutation (Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 3, Figure 1—source data 1). In contrast, MK2206 did not induce cell death in non-transformed bronchial epithelial cells (data not shown). MK2206 also did not induce cell death in lung cancer cell lines with activating EGFR mutations (Figure 1—figure supplement 4, Figure 1—source data 1) which have been linked with aberrant PI3K pathway activation (Engelman et al., 2005), suggesting that the mode of PI3K activation is critical in establishing AKT addiction in cancer.  To exclude the possibility that the greater cell death induction by the allosteric AKT inhibitor was due to additional effects on proteins other than AKT, we stably expressed a synthetic AKT mutant in which a residue critical for allosteric inhibitor binding (tryptophan 80) (Green et al., 2008; Calleja et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010) had been replaced by an alanine. Expression of AKT1 W80A or AKT2 W80A but not wild-type AKT1 or wild-type AKT2 completely rescued MK2206-induced cell death (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 5, Figure 1—source data 1). Western blot analysis confirmed that these AKT alleles are biochemically insensitive to MK2206 and prevented the induction of PARP cleavage, a marker of apoptosis (Figure 1—figure supplement 6, Figure 1—source data 1).  Of note, all three inhibitors were able to induce near-complete proliferation arrest (Figure 1—figure supplement 7, Figure 1—source data 1). These results demonstrate that allosteric and ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors differ in their ability to block AKT-mediated survival, and that this survival signal can be mediated by AKT1 or AKT2.  AKT regulates survival through phosphorylation of several protein substrates. We were therefore surprised that ATP-competitive inhibitors induced less cell death than MK2206 despite greater or equal inhibition of AKT substrate phosphorylation (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 8). We could not explain these results by differential effects on induction of ErbB3 expression or IGF-IRβ phosphorylation (Figure 1—figure supplement 9) which can accompany AKT inhibition and mediate resistance to AKT inhibitors (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011).  One potential explanation for our observations is that ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors might induce an AKT conformation which can serve as a platform for a kinase-independent survival signal (Figure 2A). If true, ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors might antagonize cell death induction by a variety of cell death stimuli, for example, inhibition of the MET kinase in MET-amplified EBC1 cells. We found this to be the case. Despite inducing a modest amount of cell death as single agent, GSK690693 antagonized the ability of crizotinib to kill EBC1 cells. The allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206, in contrast, did not compromise the ability of crizotinib to induce cell death (Figure 2B, Figure 2—source data 1).  Figure 2. Figure 2. Catalytically inactive AKT supports the survival of AKT-dependent human cancer cells. To provide genetic evidence for the kinase-independent AKT function, we took advantage of a synthetic AKT mutant which is catalytically inactive due to substitution of lysine by methionine at position 179 at the ATP-binding site (AKT K179M) (Franke et al., 1995). When we expressed this mutant in MCF7 breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-361 breast cancer cells and EBC1 lung cancer cells, catalytically inactive AKT (Figure 2C/D/E, Figure 2—source data 1) but not wild-type AKT (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—source data 1), protected from MK2206-induced cell death. Compared to the complete cell death protection provided by the drug-resistant W80A-AKT allele (Figure 1E, Figure 1—source data 1), the protection by the K179M-AKT allele was only partial, consistent with the coexistence of kinase-independent and kinase-dependent AKT signals.  We also used an AKT knockdown strategy to minimize the effect of AKT overexpression on the stoichiometry of the AKT signaling complex. For this purpose, we first generated EBC1 cells with doxycycline-inducible human-specific shRNAs for both AKT 1 and AKT 2 and then expressed a kinase-deficient (AKT1-K179M) AKT1 cDNA of murine origin that is partially resistant to knockdown due to mismatches in the mouse sequence. Protein levels of the hairpin-resistant AKT allele after doxycycline induction were similar to the levels of endogenous AKT in parental EBC1 cells (Figure 2F, top, lanes 6 and 8 vs lanes 1 and 3). Similar to our results with pharmacological AKT blockade, catalytically inactive AKT protected from cell death following doxycycline treatment and AKT depletion of these cells (Figure 2F, bottom, Figure 2—source data 1).  We next examined the effects of AKT inhibitors on phosphoinositide (PI) binding. In the absence of growth factors, AKT is inactive because intermolecular interactions between the pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase domain (KD) keep the kinase in a closed conformation (Calleja et al., 2009). Following growth factor stimulation, AKT shifts to an open conformation and becomes accessible to phosphorylation on threonine 308 and serine 473, a process that requires localization of AKT to the plasma membrane through the interaction with the phospholipid products of PI3K, phosphatidyl-inositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns (3,4,5)P3], and PtdIns(3,4)P2. Using a PI pull-down assay, we observed that MK2206 markedly impaired phosphoinositide binding (Figure 3A). This result is consistent with findings from structural studies that allosteric AKT inhibitors lock AKT in a closed conformation with its phospholipid binding site blocked by the kinase domain (Wu et al., 2010). In contrast to our findings with MK2206, incubation with the ATP-competitive inhibitor GSK690693 increased binding of AKT to PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 and this was associated with increased localization of AKT to the plasma membrane (Figure 3B).  Figure 3. Figure 3. Kinase-dead AKT protects from drug-induced cell death in a PH-domain-dependent manner. We next explored the structural requirements for the pro-survival signal of catalytically inactive AKT. Similar to GSK690693-bound AKT, the AKT1-K179M (or AKT2-K181M) mutant was hyper-phosphorylated at T308 (Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This phosphorylation event occurs at the plasma membrane (Stephens et al., 1998) and immunofluorescence in MCF10A and EBC1 cells confirmed that kinase-dead AKT was constitutively localized to the plasma membrane (Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 2).  To examine whether membrane localization was sufficient for the pro-survival function of AKT1-K179M, we replaced the PH-domain of AKT1-K179M by a membrane-targeting myristoylation signal and expressed this mutant in EBC1 cells. This mutant was unable to inhibit MK2206-induced cell death (Figure 3E, Figure 3—source data 1) despite being constitutively phosphorylated in the presence of MK2206 (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Lastly, we abolished the ability of the AKT1-K179M mutant to bind phospholipids by introducing a second substitution at an amino acid residue (R86) critical for binding of AKT to PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 (Thomas et al., 2002). Consistent with a loss of membrane localization, the R86A/K179M double mutant showed loss of AKT phosphorylation at threonine 308 when expressed in HCT116 cells that express no endogenous AKT (Ericson et al., 2010) (Figure 3—figure supplement 4A) and it did not protect from MK2206-induced dephosphorylation in cells which do express endogenous AKT (Figure 3—figure supplement 4B). Abrogation of phosphoinositide binding by the R86A substitution did not impair the pro-survival function of kinase-defective AKT (Figure 3F, Figure 3—source data 1). We observed a similar result with a second mutation (R25C) known to abolish phosphoinositide binding (Thomas et al., 2002) (Figure 3—figure supplement 4C, Figure 3—source data 1).  Mutations in the coding sequence of AKT are rare in human cancers but provide important insights into AKT regulation (Parikh et al., 2012). We wondered whether there was precedence in human cancer for kinase-dead AKT mutations. Our survey of published cancer sequencing data identified five AKT2 kinase domain mutations that occurred in at least two independent samples (G161V/E, R170W, I289M, H355Y, R368C/H) (Figure 4A). We engineered each of these mutations into an AKT2 expression vector and stably expressed the mutant protein in HCT116 cells with targeted deletions of AKT1 and AKT2 (HCT116-DKO). AKT2-G161V, but none of the other four kinase domain mutants, showed complete loss of in vitro AKT substrate phosphorylation, comparable to the synthetic kinase-dead K181M-AKT2 mutant included as control in our experiments (Figure 4B). Whole-cell lysates from G161V-AKT2 expressing cells showed loss of phosphorylation for the endogenous AKT kinase substrates PRAS40 and BAD (Figure 4C). In the phosphoinositide pull-down assay, AKT2-G161V showed altered phosphoinositide binding with acquired preference for PtdIns(4,5)P2, again similar to the synthetic kinase-dead AKT2 mutant (Figure 4D).  Figure 4. Figure 4. AKT mutants found in human cancer can promote cell survival independently of kinase activity. Since AKT2-G161V was found in a human melanoma sample, we explored the pro-survival potential of this mutant in immortalized human melanocytes. These cells required 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for survival in culture, as has previously been reported (Arita et al., 1992), but acquired the ability to survive in TPA-deficient media (RPMI) after stable expression of AKT2-G161V (Figure 4E, Figure 4—source data 1).  The increased PI(4,5)P2 binding of the kinase-dead G161V-AKT2 mutant (Figure 4D) was reminiscent of the most common somatic AKT mutation in human cancer (E17K-AKT1) which localizes to the plasma membrane due to increased affinity for the constitutive plasma membrane lipid PI(4,5)P2 (Carpten et al., 2007; Landgraf et al., 2008). This raised the question whether kinase activity might be dispensable for the pro-survival functions of the oncogenic E17K-AKT1 mutant. To explore this question, we compared the effects of E17K-AKT1 and a kinase-defective allele of this mutant (E17K/K179M-AKT1) in EBC1 cells. Compared to cells transduced with wild-type AKT, cells transduced with the E17K-AKT1 mutant showed residual AKT phosphorylation at equimolar concentrations of MK2206 (Figure 4F), consistent with the reported reduced sensitivity of E17K-AKT1 to allosteric ATP kinase inhibitors (Calleja et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Parikh et al., 2012). Expression of E17K-AKT1 provided partial protection from MK2206-induced cell death (Figure 4G, Figure 4—source data 1). Interestingly, the E17K/K179M-AKT1 double mutant provided a similar degree of protection as the E17K-AKT1 single mutant, suggesting that this cancer-associated PH-domain mutant can mediate survival signals independent of its catalytic activity in certain cellular contexts.  Lastly, we identified a human endometrial cancer cell line with a kinase domain mutation in AKT1 (G311D) (Barretina et al., 2012) that failed to induce phosphorylation of endogenous AKT substrates in AKT1/2 DKO HCT116 cells (Figure 5A). While knockdown of endogenous AKT1 or AKT2 resulted in growth inhibition, knockdown of AKT1 resulted in substantially greater cell death induction than knockdown of AKT2 (Figure 5B, Figure 5—source data 1), suggesting a state of addiction to signals provided by the mutant AKT1.  Figure 5. Figure 5. Endometrial cancer cells expressing endogenous kinase-deficient AKT1 are sensitive to AKT1 but not AKT2 knockdown. Go to: Discussion The work presented here represents the first example of a kinase-independent function of AKT (Figure 4H). Our findings that catalytically inactivating kinase domain mutations (AKT1-K179M, AKT2-K181M, AKT2-G161V) or ATP-competitive inhibitor binding to wild-type AKT can promote phosphoinositide binding document the critical importance of the kinase domain conformation on AKT PH-domain functions. It also suggests that hyper-phosphorylation of AKT in response to ATP-competitive inhibitors (Okuzumi et al., 2009) may not only be due to impaired phosphatase access (Chan et al., 2011) but also due to increased phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, given that the loss of phosphoinositide binding does not completely abolish the pro-survival function of kinase-deficient AKT, we suspect that the PH-domain promotes cell survival through regulation of interacting protein partners, and that perturbations in the kinase domain can influence PH-domain function by altering the ability of AKT to reach the appropriate sub-cellular compartment (likely those richest in PI(4,5)P2) and/or interact with specific effector proteins. Further studies are required to identify the effectors of catalytically inactive AKT and define its contribution to other AKT-regulated cellular processes.  Our findings have implications for the development of drugs to block AKT in cancer. Previous studies have shown that cancer-associated AKT mutations that favor an open conformation show reduced sensitivity to allosteric AKT inhibitors but retain sensitivity to ATP-competitive inhibitors (Calleja et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Parikh et al., 2012). Here, we show that cancer cells with aberrant AKT activation by common PI3K pathway lesions (HER2, PIK3CA, MET) show the opposite drug sensitivity profile with reduced sensitivity to ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors. The inability of ATP-competitive inhibitors to suppress non-catalytic AKT functions in certain genetic contexts may represent a liability compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors.

Go to: Methods Western blots  Cells were harvested directly on tissue culture plates with 1% triton cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, and normalized to equal amounts of total protein using the DC protein assay (Biorad).  Retroviral infections  For transduction of wild-type and mutant AKT alleles into EBC1, HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/−, MCF7, and MDA-MB-361 cells, amphotropic retroviruses were generated by co-transfection of retroviral constructs carrying the appropriate cDNA and the packaging plasmid pCL-Ampho (IMGENEX, San Diego, CA) into 293T cells. Viral particles were collected after 36 and 60 hr following transfection and target cells were infected for 18 hr with the respective virus. Stable expressors were derived through antibiotic selection. To immortalize human epidermal melanocytes (iHEM), primary melanocytes (ScienCell) were retrovirally infected with amphotropic pbabe-hTERT + p53DD virus using the above transduction protocol. For lentiviral transduction of Tet-inducible shRNAs targeting AKT1 and AKT2, viral particles were produced by co-transfection of shRNA constructs (listed above) with two packaging plasmids (pMD2G and pPAX2) into 293T cells. Five different viruses were generated (2 AKT1 hairpins and 3 AKT2 hairpins). Viral particles were collected at 36 and 60 hr after transfection. All five viruses were mixed, and infection of EBC1 cells was carried out for 8 hr after each virus collection. 36 hours after the last infection, cells were selected with 10 µM puromycin to derive stable expressors. Following selection, cells were also transduced with pLNCX-HA-mAKT1-K179M retrovirus and selected with 1 mg/ml G148 to generate cells with a hairpin-resistant AKT1-K179M allele.  Cell death assay  Cells were seeded on 6 cm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then treated with the indicated drugs at the indicated doses. Each treatment group was seeded in triplicate. Following treatment, both attached and unattached cells were harvested and counted on a ViCell Cell Viability analyzer. The instrument uses trypan blue to assess cell death. Cell death was expressed as the fraction of trypan blue-positive cells over the total number of cells. Statistical significance was assessed by one-tailed unequal variance t-test (ns = p > 0.05; * = p ≤ 0.05; ** = p ≤ 0.01, *** = p ≤ 0.001).  AKT kinase assay  AKT kinase assays were carried out using the non-radioactive AKT Kinase Assay Kit from Cell Signaling Technologies (Catalog #9840) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modification: HA-Tag antibody Sepharose bead conjugate was used to isolate AKT kinase. Briefly, HCT116 AKT1/2 DKO cells expressing exogenous HA-tagged AKT alleles were lysed in 1× lysis buffer and sonicated. Sonicated lysates were normalized to equal amounts of total protein. AKT was then purified from normalized lysates by HA immunoprecipitation for 3 hr at 4°C. HA beads were then washed two times with 500 µl lysis buffer and once with 1× kinase buffer. Beads were then resuspended in 50 µl kinase buffer, and kinase reaction was carried out for 30 min after addition of 1 µg of substrate and ATP to a final concentration of 200 µM. Reaction was terminated by adding 3× Laemmli buffer. 10 µl of kinase reaction were analyzed by immunoblot. Substrate phosphorylation and AKT content in each reaction was measured by immunoblot.  PIP binding assay  HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/− (with or without exogenous AKT) cells were grown on a monolayer, washed once with cold PBS, and harvested on the dish using lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, and EDTA-free protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Lysates were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. Cleared lysates were then normalized to equal amounts of total protein. The amount of AKT in each lysate was then quantified by Western blot using an HA antibody and the lysates normalized for AKT content using image analysis of AKT immunoreactive bands. Lysate from parental HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/− cells was used to normalize a second time for total protein amount. Each lysate was then divided into 10 aliquots to verify the final normalization by Western blot and for PIP binding analysis. PIP beads were obtained from Echelon Biosciences Inc. (Echelon Inc, Salt Lake City, UT). Each lysate was incubated with one PIP variant (30 μl of 50% bead slurry equivalent to approximately 200 pmoles) for 3 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with 10 vol of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling PIP beads in 3× Laemmli Sample Buffer at 95°C.  Immunofluorescence  Cells were washed with 1× PBS at room temperature, fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min, and permeabilized for 2 min in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Coverslips were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (wt/vol) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Primary antibody incubation was done for 1 hr in blocking solution, followed by five 1× PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 washes. Secondary antibody incubation was carried out for 1 hr followed by five washes and incubated with DAPI for 2 min to visualize DNA. Fluorescent images were acquired on an upright microscope (Axio imager; Carl Zeiss) equipped with 100× oil objectives, NA of 1.45, a camera (ORCA ER; Hamamatsu Photonics), and a computer loaded with image-processing software (Axiovision).  For confocal analysis, EBC1 cells were plated on fibronectin coated coverslips, washed with 1× PBS, fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Coverslips were then incubated in blocking solution (10% donkey serum, 0.1% BSA in PBS) for 1 hr, followed by incubation with a primary antibody (anti-HA) in blocking solution for 1 hr. Alexa-488 anti-mouse antibodies were used for detection. Coverslips were then incubated with Phalloidin 546 for 30 min. Nuclei were stained with DAPI for 3 min. Coverslips were then mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade reagent and images were acquired with a 40× magnification lens in a Leica TCS-SP5 (WLL) multiphoton confocal microscope.  
1373||The serine–threonine kinase AKT regulates proliferation and survival by phosphorylating a network of protein substrates. In this study, we describe a kinase-independent function of AKT. In cancer cells harboring gain-of-function alterations in MET, HER2, or Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K), catalytically inactive AKT (K179M) protected from drug induced cell death in a PH-domain dependent manner. An AKT kinase domain mutant found in human melanoma (G161V) lacked enzymatic activity in vitro and in AKT1/AKT2 double knockout cells, but promoted growth factor independent survival of primary human melanocytes. ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors failed to block the kinase-independent function of AKT, a liability that limits their effectiveness compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors. Our results broaden the current view of AKT function and have important implications for the development of AKT inhibitors for cancer.  DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03751.001  Research organism: human, mouse Go to: eLife digest To maintain a healthy body, the ability of our cells to survive and divide is normally strictly controlled. If any cells manage to escape these restrictions, they may rapidly divide and form tumors, which can lead to cancer.  A protein called AKT can encourage cells to survive and divide, and in healthy cells it is only allowed to be active at specific times. However, in many cancer cells, the genes that make and control AKT activity can be altered by mutations, which can result in AKT being active at the wrong times.  Part of the AKT protein acts as an enzyme called a kinase and adds chemical groups called phosphates to other proteins. The phosphate groups can activate or deactivate these proteins to control cell survival and cell division. However, there are other sections to the AKT protein and it is not clear how they are involved in this protein's activity.  In this study, Vivanco et al. show that AKT has another role in cell survival that does not depend on its kinase. The experiments show that even when the kinase part of the protein is missing, AKT can help cancer cells to survive drug treatments and external conditions that would normally kill them. This role requires another section of the protein called the PH-domain.  There are several chemicals—called inhibitors—that can stop AKT from working properly, and they have the potential to be used to treat some types of cancer. These inhibitors work in different ways: some were able to block the activity of the kinase, but others inhibited AKT by binding to other parts of the protein. Therefore, to develop AKT inhibitors into effective drugs, it will be important to know precisely what role the protein plays in different types of cancers.  DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03751.002  Go to: Introduction The serine–threonine kinase AKT is a non-receptor kinase that plays critical roles in growth and metabolism (Pearce et al., 2010). AKT is aberrantly activated in many human cancers, usually due to mutations in upstream components of the Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway. AKT signaling is required for tumor maintenance in certain genetic contexts, as has been shown for some cancer cell lines harboring PI3K mutations or amplification of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase (She et al., 2008). Encouraged by these results, several ATP-competitive and allosteric AKT inhibitors have been identified (Engelman, 2009), but optimal strategies for the clinical development of these agents are currently unknown.  Go to: Results To address this question, we compared the activity of the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206 (Hirai et al., 2010) with the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors GSK690693 (Heerding et al., 2008; Rhodes et al., 2008) and GDC0068 (Lin et al., 2013). Each of these AKT inhibitors dose dependently inhibited AKT kinase activity in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line EBC1 as determined by phosphorylation of three AKT substrates (PRAS40, GSK3β, and BAD) in whole-cell lysates (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Consistent with previous reports (Okuzumi et al., 2009), the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors induced hyper-phosphorylation of AKT at the two regulatory phosphorylation sites threonine 308 and serine 473. When we compared the ability of the AKT inhibitors to induce cell death using a trypan blue exclusion assay, we observed significantly greater cell death induction by the allosteric inhibitor MK2206 compared to the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors GSK690693 (Figure 1B—source data 1) and GDC0068 (Figure 1C—source data 1) despite less complete inhibition of AKT substrate phosphorylation at these drug concentrations (Figure 1A).  Figure 1. Figure 1. Differential sensitivity of human cancer cells to different classes of AKT inhibitors. We had selected EBC1 lung cancer cells for our initial studies because they harbor amplification of MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates critical oncogenic signals through the PI3K/AKT axis (Gherardi et al., 2012). To test whether other MET-amplified human cancer cells show a similar drug response pattern, we extended our experiments to MET-amplified H1993 and H1648 NSCLC cell lines and GTL-16 gastric cancer cells. MK2206 again induced significantly more cell death than GSK690693 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 1—source data 1). In cell lines with other PI3K pathway alterations previously associated with ‘AKT-dependence’ (She et al., 2008), we also found that MK2006 induced significantly more cell death than ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors. These cell lines included breast cancer cells with HER2 amplification and/or PIK3CA-mutation (Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 3, Figure 1—source data 1). In contrast, MK2206 did not induce cell death in non-transformed bronchial epithelial cells (data not shown). MK2206 also did not induce cell death in lung cancer cell lines with activating EGFR mutations (Figure 1—figure supplement 4, Figure 1—source data 1) which have been linked with aberrant PI3K pathway activation (Engelman et al., 2005), suggesting that the mode of PI3K activation is critical in establishing AKT addiction in cancer.  To exclude the possibility that the greater cell death induction by the allosteric AKT inhibitor was due to additional effects on proteins other than AKT, we stably expressed a synthetic AKT mutant in which a residue critical for allosteric inhibitor binding (tryptophan 80) (Green et al., 2008; Calleja et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010) had been replaced by an alanine. Expression of AKT1 W80A or AKT2 W80A but not wild-type AKT1 or wild-type AKT2 completely rescued MK2206-induced cell death (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 5, Figure 1—source data 1). Western blot analysis confirmed that these AKT alleles are biochemically insensitive to MK2206 and prevented the induction of PARP cleavage, a marker of apoptosis (Figure 1—figure supplement 6, Figure 1—source data 1).  Of note, all three inhibitors were able to induce near-complete proliferation arrest (Figure 1—figure supplement 7, Figure 1—source data 1). These results demonstrate that allosteric and ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors differ in their ability to block AKT-mediated survival, and that this survival signal can be mediated by AKT1 or AKT2.  AKT regulates survival through phosphorylation of several protein substrates. We were therefore surprised that ATP-competitive inhibitors induced less cell death than MK2206 despite greater or equal inhibition of AKT substrate phosphorylation (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 8). We could not explain these results by differential effects on induction of ErbB3 expression or IGF-IRβ phosphorylation (Figure 1—figure supplement 9) which can accompany AKT inhibition and mediate resistance to AKT inhibitors (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011).  One potential explanation for our observations is that ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors might induce an AKT conformation which can serve as a platform for a kinase-independent survival signal (Figure 2A). If true, ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors might antagonize cell death induction by a variety of cell death stimuli, for example, inhibition of the MET kinase in MET-amplified EBC1 cells. We found this to be the case. Despite inducing a modest amount of cell death as single agent, GSK690693 antagonized the ability of crizotinib to kill EBC1 cells. The allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206, in contrast, did not compromise the ability of crizotinib to induce cell death (Figure 2B, Figure 2—source data 1).  Figure 2. Figure 2. Catalytically inactive AKT supports the survival of AKT-dependent human cancer cells. To provide genetic evidence for the kinase-independent AKT function, we took advantage of a synthetic AKT mutant which is catalytically inactive due to substitution of lysine by methionine at position 179 at the ATP-binding site (AKT K179M) (Franke et al., 1995). When we expressed this mutant in MCF7 breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-361 breast cancer cells and EBC1 lung cancer cells, catalytically inactive AKT (Figure 2C/D/E, Figure 2—source data 1) but not wild-type AKT (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—source data 1), protected from MK2206-induced cell death. Compared to the complete cell death protection provided by the drug-resistant W80A-AKT allele (Figure 1E, Figure 1—source data 1), the protection by the K179M-AKT allele was only partial, consistent with the coexistence of kinase-independent and kinase-dependent AKT signals.  We also used an AKT knockdown strategy to minimize the effect of AKT overexpression on the stoichiometry of the AKT signaling complex. For this purpose, we first generated EBC1 cells with doxycycline-inducible human-specific shRNAs for both AKT 1 and AKT 2 and then expressed a kinase-deficient (AKT1-K179M) AKT1 cDNA of murine origin that is partially resistant to knockdown due to mismatches in the mouse sequence. Protein levels of the hairpin-resistant AKT allele after doxycycline induction were similar to the levels of endogenous AKT in parental EBC1 cells (Figure 2F, top, lanes 6 and 8 vs lanes 1 and 3). Similar to our results with pharmacological AKT blockade, catalytically inactive AKT protected from cell death following doxycycline treatment and AKT depletion of these cells (Figure 2F, bottom, Figure 2—source data 1).  We next examined the effects of AKT inhibitors on phosphoinositide (PI) binding. In the absence of growth factors, AKT is inactive because intermolecular interactions between the pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase domain (KD) keep the kinase in a closed conformation (Calleja et al., 2009). Following growth factor stimulation, AKT shifts to an open conformation and becomes accessible to phosphorylation on threonine 308 and serine 473, a process that requires localization of AKT to the plasma membrane through the interaction with the phospholipid products of PI3K, phosphatidyl-inositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns (3,4,5)P3], and PtdIns(3,4)P2. Using a PI pull-down assay, we observed that MK2206 markedly impaired phosphoinositide binding (Figure 3A). This result is consistent with findings from structural studies that allosteric AKT inhibitors lock AKT in a closed conformation with its phospholipid binding site blocked by the kinase domain (Wu et al., 2010). In contrast to our findings with MK2206, incubation with the ATP-competitive inhibitor GSK690693 increased binding of AKT to PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 and this was associated with increased localization of AKT to the plasma membrane (Figure 3B).  Figure 3. Figure 3. Kinase-dead AKT protects from drug-induced cell death in a PH-domain-dependent manner. We next explored the structural requirements for the pro-survival signal of catalytically inactive AKT. Similar to GSK690693-bound AKT, the AKT1-K179M (or AKT2-K181M) mutant was hyper-phosphorylated at T308 (Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This phosphorylation event occurs at the plasma membrane (Stephens et al., 1998) and immunofluorescence in MCF10A and EBC1 cells confirmed that kinase-dead AKT was constitutively localized to the plasma membrane (Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 2).  To examine whether membrane localization was sufficient for the pro-survival function of AKT1-K179M, we replaced the PH-domain of AKT1-K179M by a membrane-targeting myristoylation signal and expressed this mutant in EBC1 cells. This mutant was unable to inhibit MK2206-induced cell death (Figure 3E, Figure 3—source data 1) despite being constitutively phosphorylated in the presence of MK2206 (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Lastly, we abolished the ability of the AKT1-K179M mutant to bind phospholipids by introducing a second substitution at an amino acid residue (R86) critical for binding of AKT to PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 (Thomas et al., 2002). Consistent with a loss of membrane localization, the R86A/K179M double mutant showed loss of AKT phosphorylation at threonine 308 when expressed in HCT116 cells that express no endogenous AKT (Ericson et al., 2010) (Figure 3—figure supplement 4A) and it did not protect from MK2206-induced dephosphorylation in cells which do express endogenous AKT (Figure 3—figure supplement 4B). Abrogation of phosphoinositide binding by the R86A substitution did not impair the pro-survival function of kinase-defective AKT (Figure 3F, Figure 3—source data 1). We observed a similar result with a second mutation (R25C) known to abolish phosphoinositide binding (Thomas et al., 2002) (Figure 3—figure supplement 4C, Figure 3—source data 1).  Mutations in the coding sequence of AKT are rare in human cancers but provide important insights into AKT regulation (Parikh et al., 2012). We wondered whether there was precedence in human cancer for kinase-dead AKT mutations. Our survey of published cancer sequencing data identified five AKT2 kinase domain mutations that occurred in at least two independent samples (G161V/E, R170W, I289M, H355Y, R368C/H) (Figure 4A). We engineered each of these mutations into an AKT2 expression vector and stably expressed the mutant protein in HCT116 cells with targeted deletions of AKT1 and AKT2 (HCT116-DKO). AKT2-G161V, but none of the other four kinase domain mutants, showed complete loss of in vitro AKT substrate phosphorylation, comparable to the synthetic kinase-dead K181M-AKT2 mutant included as control in our experiments (Figure 4B). Whole-cell lysates from G161V-AKT2 expressing cells showed loss of phosphorylation for the endogenous AKT kinase substrates PRAS40 and BAD (Figure 4C). In the phosphoinositide pull-down assay, AKT2-G161V showed altered phosphoinositide binding with acquired preference for PtdIns(4,5)P2, again similar to the synthetic kinase-dead AKT2 mutant (Figure 4D).  Figure 4. Figure 4. AKT mutants found in human cancer can promote cell survival independently of kinase activity. Since AKT2-G161V was found in a human melanoma sample, we explored the pro-survival potential of this mutant in immortalized human melanocytes. These cells required 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for survival in culture, as has previously been reported (Arita et al., 1992), but acquired the ability to survive in TPA-deficient media (RPMI) after stable expression of AKT2-G161V (Figure 4E, Figure 4—source data 1).  The increased PI(4,5)P2 binding of the kinase-dead G161V-AKT2 mutant (Figure 4D) was reminiscent of the most common somatic AKT mutation in human cancer (E17K-AKT1) which localizes to the plasma membrane due to increased affinity for the constitutive plasma membrane lipid PI(4,5)P2 (Carpten et al., 2007; Landgraf et al., 2008). This raised the question whether kinase activity might be dispensable for the pro-survival functions of the oncogenic E17K-AKT1 mutant. To explore this question, we compared the effects of E17K-AKT1 and a kinase-defective allele of this mutant (E17K/K179M-AKT1) in EBC1 cells. Compared to cells transduced with wild-type AKT, cells transduced with the E17K-AKT1 mutant showed residual AKT phosphorylation at equimolar concentrations of MK2206 (Figure 4F), consistent with the reported reduced sensitivity of E17K-AKT1 to allosteric ATP kinase inhibitors (Calleja et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Parikh et al., 2012). Expression of E17K-AKT1 provided partial protection from MK2206-induced cell death (Figure 4G, Figure 4—source data 1). Interestingly, the E17K/K179M-AKT1 double mutant provided a similar degree of protection as the E17K-AKT1 single mutant, suggesting that this cancer-associated PH-domain mutant can mediate survival signals independent of its catalytic activity in certain cellular contexts.  Lastly, we identified a human endometrial cancer cell line with a kinase domain mutation in AKT1 (G311D) (Barretina et al., 2012) that failed to induce phosphorylation of endogenous AKT substrates in AKT1/2 DKO HCT116 cells (Figure 5A). While knockdown of endogenous AKT1 or AKT2 resulted in growth inhibition, knockdown of AKT1 resulted in substantially greater cell death induction than knockdown of AKT2 (Figure 5B, Figure 5—source data 1), suggesting a state of addiction to signals provided by the mutant AKT1.  Figure 5. Figure 5. Endometrial cancer cells expressing endogenous kinase-deficient AKT1 are sensitive to AKT1 but not AKT2 knockdown. Go to: Discussion The work presented here represents the first example of a kinase-independent function of AKT (Figure 4H). Our findings that catalytically inactivating kinase domain mutations (AKT1-K179M, AKT2-K181M, AKT2-G161V) or ATP-competitive inhibitor binding to wild-type AKT can promote phosphoinositide binding document the critical importance of the kinase domain conformation on AKT PH-domain functions. It also suggests that hyper-phosphorylation of AKT in response to ATP-competitive inhibitors (Okuzumi et al., 2009) may not only be due to impaired phosphatase access (Chan et al., 2011) but also due to increased phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, given that the loss of phosphoinositide binding does not completely abolish the pro-survival function of kinase-deficient AKT, we suspect that the PH-domain promotes cell survival through regulation of interacting protein partners, and that perturbations in the kinase domain can influence PH-domain function by altering the ability of AKT to reach the appropriate sub-cellular compartment (likely those richest in PI(4,5)P2) and/or interact with specific effector proteins. Further studies are required to identify the effectors of catalytically inactive AKT and define its contribution to other AKT-regulated cellular processes.  Our findings have implications for the development of drugs to block AKT in cancer. Previous studies have shown that cancer-associated AKT mutations that favor an open conformation show reduced sensitivity to allosteric AKT inhibitors but retain sensitivity to ATP-competitive inhibitors (Calleja et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Parikh et al., 2012). Here, we show that cancer cells with aberrant AKT activation by common PI3K pathway lesions (HER2, PIK3CA, MET) show the opposite drug sensitivity profile with reduced sensitivity to ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors. The inability of ATP-competitive inhibitors to suppress non-catalytic AKT functions in certain genetic contexts may represent a liability compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors.

Go to: Methods Western blots  Cells were harvested directly on tissue culture plates with 1% triton cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, and normalized to equal amounts of total protein using the DC protein assay (Biorad).  Retroviral infections  For transduction of wild-type and mutant AKT alleles into EBC1, HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/−, MCF7, and MDA-MB-361 cells, amphotropic retroviruses were generated by co-transfection of retroviral constructs carrying the appropriate cDNA and the packaging plasmid pCL-Ampho (IMGENEX, San Diego, CA) into 293T cells. Viral particles were collected after 36 and 60 hr following transfection and target cells were infected for 18 hr with the respective virus. Stable expressors were derived through antibiotic selection. To immortalize human epidermal melanocytes (iHEM), primary melanocytes (ScienCell) were retrovirally infected with amphotropic pbabe-hTERT + p53DD virus using the above transduction protocol. For lentiviral transduction of Tet-inducible shRNAs targeting AKT1 and AKT2, viral particles were produced by co-transfection of shRNA constructs (listed above) with two packaging plasmids (pMD2G and pPAX2) into 293T cells. Five different viruses were generated (2 AKT1 hairpins and 3 AKT2 hairpins). Viral particles were collected at 36 and 60 hr after transfection. All five viruses were mixed, and infection of EBC1 cells was carried out for 8 hr after each virus collection. 36 hours after the last infection, cells were selected with 10 µM puromycin to derive stable expressors. Following selection, cells were also transduced with pLNCX-HA-mAKT1-K179M retrovirus and selected with 1 mg/ml G148 to generate cells with a hairpin-resistant AKT1-K179M allele.  Cell death assay  Cells were seeded on 6 cm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then treated with the indicated drugs at the indicated doses. Each treatment group was seeded in triplicate. Following treatment, both attached and unattached cells were harvested and counted on a ViCell Cell Viability analyzer. The instrument uses trypan blue to assess cell death. Cell death was expressed as the fraction of trypan blue-positive cells over the total number of cells. Statistical significance was assessed by one-tailed unequal variance t-test (ns = p > 0.05; * = p ≤ 0.05; ** = p ≤ 0.01, *** = p ≤ 0.001).  AKT kinase assay  AKT kinase assays were carried out using the non-radioactive AKT Kinase Assay Kit from Cell Signaling Technologies (Catalog #9840) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modification: HA-Tag antibody Sepharose bead conjugate was used to isolate AKT kinase. Briefly, HCT116 AKT1/2 DKO cells expressing exogenous HA-tagged AKT alleles were lysed in 1× lysis buffer and sonicated. Sonicated lysates were normalized to equal amounts of total protein. AKT was then purified from normalized lysates by HA immunoprecipitation for 3 hr at 4°C. HA beads were then washed two times with 500 µl lysis buffer and once with 1× kinase buffer. Beads were then resuspended in 50 µl kinase buffer, and kinase reaction was carried out for 30 min after addition of 1 µg of substrate and ATP to a final concentration of 200 µM. Reaction was terminated by adding 3× Laemmli buffer. 10 µl of kinase reaction were analyzed by immunoblot. Substrate phosphorylation and AKT content in each reaction was measured by immunoblot.  PIP binding assay  HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/− (with or without exogenous AKT) cells were grown on a monolayer, washed once with cold PBS, and harvested on the dish using lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, and EDTA-free protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Lysates were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. Cleared lysates were then normalized to equal amounts of total protein. The amount of AKT in each lysate was then quantified by Western blot using an HA antibody and the lysates normalized for AKT content using image analysis of AKT immunoreactive bands. Lysate from parental HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/− cells was used to normalize a second time for total protein amount. Each lysate was then divided into 10 aliquots to verify the final normalization by Western blot and for PIP binding analysis. PIP beads were obtained from Echelon Biosciences Inc. (Echelon Inc, Salt Lake City, UT). Each lysate was incubated with one PIP variant (30 μl of 50% bead slurry equivalent to approximately 200 pmoles) for 3 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with 10 vol of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling PIP beads in 3× Laemmli Sample Buffer at 95°C.  Immunofluorescence  Cells were washed with 1× PBS at room temperature, fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min, and permeabilized for 2 min in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Coverslips were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (wt/vol) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Primary antibody incubation was done for 1 hr in blocking solution, followed by five 1× PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 washes. Secondary antibody incubation was carried out for 1 hr followed by five washes and incubated with DAPI for 2 min to visualize DNA. Fluorescent images were acquired on an upright microscope (Axio imager; Carl Zeiss) equipped with 100× oil objectives, NA of 1.45, a camera (ORCA ER; Hamamatsu Photonics), and a computer loaded with image-processing software (Axiovision).  For confocal analysis, EBC1 cells were plated on fibronectin coated coverslips, washed with 1× PBS, fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Coverslips were then incubated in blocking solution (10% donkey serum, 0.1% BSA in PBS) for 1 hr, followed by incubation with a primary antibody (anti-HA) in blocking solution for 1 hr. Alexa-488 anti-mouse antibodies were used for detection. Coverslips were then incubated with Phalloidin 546 for 30 min. Nuclei were stained with DAPI for 3 min. Coverslips were then mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade reagent and images were acquired with a 40× magnification lens in a Leica TCS-SP5 (WLL) multiphoton confocal microscope.  
1751||Mutations in metabolic enzymes, including isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2, in cancer strongly implicate altered metabolism in tumorigenesis. IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze the interconversion of isocitrate and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). 2OG is a TCA cycle intermediate and an essential cofactor for many enzymes, including JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases, TET 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases, and EglN prolyl-4-hydroxylases. Cancer-associated IDH mutations alter the enzymes such that they reduce 2OG to the structurally similar metabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2HG]. Here we review what is known about the molecular mechanisms of transformation by mutant IDH and discuss their implications for the development of targeted therapies to treat IDH mutant malignancies.  Keywords: 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, cancer metabolism, chondrosarcoma, glioma, isocitrate dehydrogenase, leukemia Cellular metabolism has been hypothesized to play a central role in cancer since the observation made almost a century ago by Otto Warburg (Warburg 1956) that cancer cells preferentially generate energy by metabolizing glucose to lactate. Even in the presence of oxygen, cancer cells switch from generating ATP by the highly energy-efficient process of oxidative phosphorylation to the much less efficient process of glycolysis (Vander Heiden et al. 2009; Dang 2012). Why this switch occurs has long been a mystery, although the observation that normal cells use “aerobic glycolysis” during periods of increased proliferation supports the hypothesis that this metabolic switch is an important feature of rapidly dividing cells (Locasale and Cantley 2011; Lunt and Vander Heiden 2011). Recent work suggests that aerobic glycolysis facilitates cellular transformation by producing the high levels of glycolytic intermediates that proliferating cells need for the biosynthesis of lipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids. Moreover, metabolic reprogramming appears to be sufficient to mediate tumorigenesis in some systems (Lyssiotis and Cantley 2012; Sebastian et al. 2012). Nevertheless, whether altered cellular metabolism is a cause of cancer or merely an adaptive response of cancer cells in the face of accelerated cell proliferation is still a topic of some debate.  The recent identification of cancer-associated mutations in three metabolic enzymes suggests that altered cellular metabolism can indeed be a cause of some cancers (Pollard et al. 2003; King et al. 2006; Raimundo et al. 2011). Two of these enzymes, fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), are bone fide tumor suppressors, and loss-of-function mutations in FH and SDH have been identified in various cancers, including renal cell carcinomas and paragangliomas. The third mutated enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), is a more complicated case. Mutations in two isoforms of IDH, IDH1 and IDH2, are common in a diverse array of cancers, including gliomas and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (Dang et al. 2010). The mutant enzymes are not catalytically inactive. Rather, the cancer-associated mutations alter the catalytic activity of the enzymes such that they produce high levels of a metabolite, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2HG], which is normally found at very low levels in cells (Dang et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2010). How this aberrant enzymatic activity contributes to cellular transformation is an area of intense interest and some controversy, and several hypotheses have been proposed for how IDH mutations promote tumorigenesis. It has been suggested that (R)-2HG functions as an “oncometabolite” to promote cellular transformation, perhaps by altering the redox state of cells or modulating the activity of metabolic and epigenetic tumor suppressor enzymes that use the structurally similar metabolite α-ketoglutarate as a cosubstrate (Reitman and Yan 2010; Yen et al. 2010; Kaelin 2011). Others have posited that loss of IDH activity from either loss of the wild-type allele or gain of a dominant-negative mutant allele alters normal mitochondrial function and promotes the metabolic switch of cancer cells to glycolysis (Leonardi et al. 2012; Oermann et al. 2012).  Here, we review the spectrum of tumors that harbor IDH mutations and discuss what has been learned to date about how mutant IDH and (R)-2HG contribute to tumorigenesis. We also discuss the potential of mutant IDH as a therapeutic target in cancer and discuss some of the outstanding questions about mutant IDH biology that warrant further investigation.  Go to: Normal functions of the IDH family of metabolic enzymes Eukaryotic cells express three different isoforms of IDH (Fig. 1; Dalziel 1980). IDH1 and IDH2 are homodimeric NADP+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to produce α-ketoglutarate (also known as 2-oxoglutarate [2OG]), NADPH, and CO2 (Fig. 2). IDH3 is a structurally unrelated heterotetrameric NAD+-dependent enzyme that similarly decarboxylates isocitrate and produces 2OG, NADH, and CO2. The reactions catalyzed by IDH1 and IDH2 are reversible, and the directionality of the reactions therefore depends in large part on the relative Km values of the forward and reverse reactions and the relative levels of isocitrate and 2OG in the cell (Lemons et al. 2010). The reaction catalyzed by IDH3, on the other hand, is irreversible under physiologic conditions and is principally regulated by substrate availability and positive and negative allosteric effectors. Calcium, ADP, and citrate activate IDH3, whereas ATP, NADH, and NADPH inhibit this enzyme (Gabriel et al. 1986).  Figure 1. Figure 1. The role of the IDH family of enzymes in the TCA cycle. Shown here are the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic reactions that involve IDH; also shown are the principal mechanisms of entry of glucose and glutamine-derived carbon molecules into the TCA cycle. ... Figure 2. Figure 2. Reactions catalyzed by wild-type and mutant IDH1 and IDH2. Wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze a two-step reaction (indicated by blue arrows). The first step involves the oxidation of isocitrate to the unstable intermediate oxalosuccinate. In this reaction, ... The different IDH isoforms have overlapping, but nonredundant, roles in cellular metabolism (Fig. 1; Mailloux et al. 2007; Reitman and Yan 2010). IDH1 localizes to the cytoplasm and peroxisomes and plays a role in promoting the activity of the numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear dioxygenases that require 2OG as a cosubstrate (Hausinger 2004). Another important function of IDH1 is the generation of nonmitochondrial NADPH. NADPH provides critical reducing equivalents needed for lipid biosynthesis and is also an essential antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress and radiation damage (Jo et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2007). Finally, as the reaction catalyzed by IDH1 is reversible, IDH1 is capable of catalyzing the reductive carboxylation of 2OG to isocitrate, which can then be further metabolized to acetyl-CoA to support lipid biosynthesis (Koh et al. 2004; Filipp et al. 2012; Metallo et al. 2012).  IDH2 and IDH3, in contrast, localize to the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 1). IDH3 plays a central role in mitochondrial respiration by catalyzing one of the rate-limiting steps of the TCA cycle. The 2OG produced by IDH3 is further metabolized to succinate, and the NADH is used by the electron transport chain to generate ATP (Barnes et al. 1971). It is not clear whether IDH2 likewise contributes to flux through the TCA cycle. Rather, IDH2 is thought to regulate energy metabolism by modulating the relative abundance of isocitrate and 2OG in the mitochondria (DeBerardinis et al. 2008). Under conditions where levels of mitochondrial glutamate are high or under hypoxic conditions when glucose-dependent citrate production is compromised, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) converts glutamate to 2OG (Sazanov and Jackson 1994; Comte et al. 2002). The resultant increase in the 2OG:isocitrate ratio favors the reverse IDH2 reaction, which results in conversion of 2OG and NADPH to isocitrate and NADP+. This isocitrate can then be fed into the TCA cycle by IDH3, which converts the isocitrate back to 2OG and produces additional NADH, or isomerized by aconitase to produce citrate. Citrate, in addition to being a TCA cycle intermediate, is a critical metabolite required for fatty acid biosynthesis. Accordingly, IDH2-mediated reductive carboxylation of 2OG plays an important role in sustaining energy production and promoting cell proliferation during periods of hypoxia (Wise et al. 2011; Filipp et al. 2012). IDH2, as an important source of mitochondrial NADPH, also plays a critical role in the protection of cells from mitochondrial-specific oxidative stress, such as that generated by the electron transport chain (Lee et al. 2004, 2007).  Go to: IDH mutations in human cancer Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly invasive brain tumor that is notoriously refractory to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In 2008, in an effort to identify novel therapeutic targets in GBM, Parsons et al. (2008) undertook a landmark genomic sequencing effort of 22 adult primary and secondary GBM tumors. They identified recurrent somatic mutations at Arg132 of IDH1 that were present in five of the six secondary GBMs but none of the 16 primary GBMs included in the study. Several follow-up sequencing studies of malignant gliomas confirmed that IDH1 Arg132 mutations are very common in specific types of adult brain tumors, occurring in >70% of adult grade II and grade III gliomas and >80% of adult secondary GBMs (Balss et al. 2008; Bleeker et al. 2009). Moreover, many of the grade II/III gliomas and secondary GBMs that are IDH1 wild type harbor mutations at the analogous codon, Arg172, of IDH2 (Hartmann et al. 2009; Yan et al. 2009). Overall, 80%–90% of adult grade II/III gliomas and secondary GBMs harbor mutations at either Arg132 of IDH1 or Arg172 of IDH2 (Table 1; Chang et al. 2011). Conversely, <10% of primary GBMs and pediatric GBMs harbor IDH mutations, and no IDH mutations have been identified to date in brain tumors of nonglial subtypes (Balss et al. 2008; Yan et al. 2009; Capper et al. 2010; Byeon et al. 2012).  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of IDH1 and IDH2 mutant alleles in human cancers In 2009, Mardis et al. (2009) performed whole-genome sequencing of a case of normal karyotype AML (NK-AML) and identified a mutation at Arg132 of IDH1. Further sequencing efforts confirmed that IDH mutations are highly recurrent in clonal myeloid disorders. Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are present in 5%–20% of cases of de novo NK-AML and in 10%–20% of cases of secondary AML that result from leukemic transformation of “premalignant” myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) (Kosmider et al. 2010; Pardanani et al. 2010; Tefferi et al. 2010; Patnaik et al. 2012; Rakheja et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2012). IDH mutations are also present, albeit at a lower frequency (5%–10%), in chronic-phase MDS and MPN but are rare in translocation-positive AML (Mardis et al. 2009; Abbas et al. 2010). IDH2 mutations are also present in 10%–40% of cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) but are uncommon in other T- or B-cell lymphoid malignancies (Cairns et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012).  IDH mutations have been found in a number of other solid tumors besides gliomas. Over 50% of chondrosarcomas harbor IDH mutations (Amary et al. 2011a; Arai et al. 2012; Meijer et al. 2012), and IDH mutations have been linked to the pathogenesis of the enchondromatosis syndromes Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome (Pansuriya et al. 2010). Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome are rare nonhereditary pediatric cancer predisposition syndromes in which affected children develop cartilaginous tumors as their developing bones undergo endochondral ossification. Recently, sequencing analysis has determined that 40%–90% of the tumors in these patients harbor mutations at Arg132 of IDH1 or Arg172 of IDH2 (Amary et al. 2011b; Pansuriya et al. 2011). Interestingly, many of these patients develop multiple independent IDH mutant tumors but express wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 in their normal tissues. This suggests that their IDH mutations are occurring during embryonic development and that their tumors are a consequence of somatic mosaicism of mutant IDH-expressing cells. Interestingly, Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome appear to be associated with an increased risk of secondary neoplasms; in particular, gliomas and AML. IDH mutations have also been found in 10%–20% of cholangiocarcinomas as well as a few rare cases of paraganglioma, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer (Sjoblom et al. 2006; Bleeker et al. 2009; Kang et al. 2009; Gaal et al. 2010; Sequist et al. 2011; Borger et al. 2012).  Among the cancers associated with IDH mutations, the mutations appear to have a predilection for certain tumor subtypes or locations. In cholangiocarcinoma, the frequency of IDH mutations in intrahepatic tumors is 28%, whereas the frequency is only 7% in extrahepatic tumors (Borger et al. 2012). In chondrosarcomas, IDH mutations appear to be exclusive to central, periosteal, and dedifferentiated tumors, with no IDH mutations having been identified to date in peripheral chondrosarcomas or other cartilaginous tumors (Amary et al. 2011a; Arai et al. 2012).  IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur at different frequencies in different tumor types (Table 1). In gliomas, >80% of IDH mutations occur at Arg132 of IDH1 and result in replacement of the arginine residue with a histidine (IDH1 R132H) (Balss et al. 2008; Yan et al. 2009; Chang et al. 2011). In cholangiocarcinomas and chondrosarcomas, IDH1 Arg132 mutations are also far more common than IDH2 Arg172 mutations, although the IDH1 mutations in these tumors most often result in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution (IDH1 R132C) (Amary et al. 2011a; Arai et al. 2012; Borger et al. 2012). This is in contrast to AML, where IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur at similar frequencies (Abbas et al. 2010; Marcucci et al. 2010; Paschka et al. 2010; Koszarska et al. 2012). The single most common IDH mutation in AML is the replacement of Arg140 of IDH2 with a glutamine (IDH2 R140Q). Interestingly, IDH2 Arg140 mutations have not been found in gliomas, cholangiocarcinomas, or chondrosarcomas. However, an IDH1 mutation analogous to Arg140 of IDH2, IDH1 Arg100, has been described in rare cases of glioma (Pusch et al. 2011). In AITL, all of the IDH mutations reported to date are IDH2 mutations, with >90% occurring at IDH2 Arg172 (Cairns et al. 2012). Why the frequency of these different amino acid substitutions is so variable in different tumors is not known. It is also worth noting that IDH1 and IDH2 mutations appear to be mutually exclusive. There are no reported cases of brain tumors harboring both mutations, and although rare cases of IDH1/IDH2 double mutant AML have been reported, it is not clear whether these mutations occur in the same or different leukemic subclones (Paschka et al. 2010).  The prognostic significance of IDH mutations is not consistent across all tumor types. In the case of GBM, IDH mutations appear to confer a more favorable prognosis, with a median survival for patients with IDH mutant GBM of 31 mo, as compared with a median survival of 15 mo for patients with IDH wild-type GBM (Yan et al. 2009; SongTao et al. 2012). Whether this difference is driven by the IDH mutational status of the tumors or reflects other fundamental biological differences between primary and secondary GBM is as yet unclear. In AML, the prognostic significance of IDH mutations is still somewhat ambiguous. Several studies have reported that IDH mutational status does not impact prognosis in AML, whereas other studies have found that IDH mutations are associated with an increased or decreased risk of disease relapse when compared with IDH wild-type disease, depending on the specific patient population examined (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2011; Rakheja et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2012). In MDS and MPN, IDH mutations have been consistently found to be markers of poor prognosis. Furthermore, the observation that the frequency of IDH mutations is higher in late stage MPN and high-risk MDS (20%) than in early stage and low-risk disease (<4%), coupled with the observation that IDH mutations are frequently present in secondary AML, has lead to speculation that IDH mutations are involved in the progression of chronic MDS and MPN to full-blown leukemia. (Tefferi et al. 2010, 2012; Thol et al. 2010; Patnaik et al. 2012).  Go to: Catalytic activity of mutant IDH When IDH mutations were first identified in cancer, they were hypothesized to contribute to tumorigenesis by causing loss of function and dominant-negative inhibition of wild-type IDH activity (Yan et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2009). However, subsequent studies found that, on the contrary, tumor-associated IDH mutations cause a gain of function (Dang et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2010). The mutations are all located in the active sites of the enzymes. Arg100 and Arg132 in IDH1 and Arg140 and Arg172 in IDH2 form hydrogen bonds with the α-carboxyl and β-carboxyl groups of isocitrate and mediate isocitrate binding (Xu et al. 2004). Mutations at these residues decrease the binding affinity of the enzyme active sites for isocitrate and increase their binding affinity for NADPH, which significantly abrogates the normal oxidative decarboxylation activity of the enzymes (Dang et al. 2009). In addition to abrogating the “forward” catalytic activity of IDH, the mutations change the conformation of the enzyme active site such that the “reverse” reaction is only a partial reaction, one in which 2OG is reduced but not carboxylated. This results in conversion of 2OG to (R)-2HG rather than isocitrate (Fig. 2). In short, IDH mutations cause the reverse IDH reaction to be favored but partially disrupted, leading to high-level production of (R)-2HG.  Interestingly, although IDH1 and IDH2 mutants both produce (R)-2HG, they appear to have somewhat distinct enzymatic properties. Cells that express mutant IDH1 accumulate less (R)-2HG than do mutant IDH2-expressing cells (Ward et al. 2013). Moreover, (R)-2HG production by mutant IDH1 is enhanced by coexpression of wild-type IDH1, whereas mutant IDH2-expressing cells accumulate high levels of (R)-2HG independent of wild-type IDH2 activity. It has been hypothesized that the lower production of (R)-2HG by mutant IDH1 is due to the fact that cytoplasmic 2OG is limiting in cells, whereas mitochondrial 2OG is not. Consistent with this model, the addition of a mitochondrial localization signal to mutant IDH1 results in enhanced (R)-2HG production. Interestingly, mutant IDH1 forms heterodimers with wild-type IDH1, but mutant IDH2 does not bind wild-type IDH2 (Dang et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2013). It has been hypothesized that heterodimerization of wild-type and mutant IDH1 in the cytoplasm provides the mutant subunit with a local source of 2OG that can then be metabolized to (R)-2HG. Consistent with this model, it has recently been reported that loss of the wild-type IDH1 allele in IDH1 mutant gliomas is associated with significantly lower tumor levels of (R)-2HG than are seen in heterozygous IDH1 mutant tumors (Jin et al. 2013).  Go to: Mutant IDH is an oncogene In a number of different in vitro transformation assays, expression of mutant IDH promotes the proliferation and inhibits the differentiation of cells. Expression of a tumor-derived IDH1 mutant (IDH1 R132H), but not a catalytically inactive form of the mutant enzyme, enhances the proliferation and soft agar colony formation of immortalized human astrocytes and confers growth factor independence and blocks the erythropoietin-induced differentiation of TF-1 cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line (Koivunen et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013). Expression of mutant IDH is also able to inhibit the differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and the differentiation of primary murine hematopoietic stem cells and immortalized murine myeloid progenitor cells (Figueroa et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013).  Although mutant IDH is able to promote cellular transformation in vitro, the mutant enzyme does not appear to be sufficient to transform primary cells in vivo. Sasaki et al. (2012a,b) have characterized the phenotype of a conditional knock-in mouse model in which they inserted IDH1 R132H into the endogenous IDH1 locus and expressed mutant IDH in either the brains or the hematopoietic systems of mice. Brain-specific expression of IDH1 R132H during embryogenesis results in perinatal lethality of the mice from cerebral hemorrhage without evidence of underlying malignancy (Sasaki et al. 2012a). Although it is possible that the mice would develop brain tumors if they lived longer, the hematopoietic-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, which have a normal life span, similarly do not develop malignancy (Sasaki et al. 2012b).  Despite the lack of a cancer phenotype in the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, the hematopoietic stem cell phenotype of the mice does provide some insights into how mutant IDH contributes to tumorigenesis. Although IDH1 R132H-expressing bone marrow cells are not immortalized, the mice do show selective expansion of their hematopoietic stem and early progenitor compartments but not their committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitor compartments. This observation is quite interesting given the distinct self-renewal properties of these different cell types. Normal committed progenitors are unable to self-renew and are consigned to undergo further differentiation, whereas stem cells and early progenitors have inherent self-renewal capabilities (Chao et al. 2008; Orford and Scadden 2008; Seita and Weissman 2010). When stem cells and early progenitors divide, they make the decision to undergo either symmetric division, in which both daughter cells are identical to the original cell, or asymmetric division, in which one daughter cell is identical to the original cell and the other is committed to undergoing further differentiation. The balance between symmetric and asymmetric cell division is crucial to cellular homeostasis. Excessive symmetric division causes inappropriate expansion of stem cell compartments, whereas excessive asymmetric division results in stem cell exhaustion (Jacob and Osato 2009; Marciniak-Czochra et al. 2009; Matsumoto and Nakayama 2013). The observation that only stem and early progenitor cells are expanded in the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice suggests that mutant IDH promotes leukemogenesis by increasing symmetric division within a population of cells that have inherent self-renewal capacity but that mutant IDH is not, by itself, able to immortalize self-renewing cells or bestow self-renewal upon more differentiated cells. This observation has important biological implications. The limited ability of mutant IDH to promote the proliferation of primary cells suggests that the specific cell lineage in which the IDH mutation occurs significantly influences the ability of the mutation to contribute to transformation. An IDH mutation in a committed progenitor cell would likely not confer a proliferative advantage to that cell, whereas the same mutation in a more primitive cell would contribute to clonal expansion.  It is also notable that hematopoietic stem cells isolated from IDH1 R132H knock-in mice are able to differentiate normally in vitro and are able to competitively repopulate the bone marrow of transplanted recipient mice. This suggests that expression of mutant IDH has little if any effect on cellular differentiation in otherwise normal hematopoietic cells. This limited ability of mutant IDH to block the differentiation of normal primary cells suggests that other specific mutations that cooperate with mutant IDH to block cellular differentiation are likely to be required to bring about the maturation arrest that is characteristic of leukemia cells.  Go to: Mutant IDH-derived (R)-2HG is an oncometabolite 2HG is a five-carbon dicarboxylic acid with a chiral center at the second carbon atom (Fig. 2). There are therefore two possible enantiomers of 2HG: (R)-2HG [otherwise known as (D)-2HG] and (S)-2HG [otherwise known as (L)-2HG]. (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG are both byproducts of normal mitochondrial metabolism (Kranendijk et al. 2012). The principal source of (R)-2HG in IDH wild-type cells is a reaction catalyzed by hydroxyacid–oxoacid transhydrogenase (HOT) (Struys et al. 2005b). HOT converts γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) to succinic semialdehyde (SSA), with concomitant reduction of 2OG to (R)-2HG. (S)-2HG is generated during conversion of oxaloacetate to (L)-malate by (L)-malate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the TCA cycle (Rzem et al. 2007).  (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG are believed to be unwanted byproducts of cellular metabolism, and their intracellular levels in normal cells are maintained at <0.1 mM. 2HG is prevented from accumulating in cells by the actions of two enzymes—(D)-2HG and (L)-2HG dehydrogenase (2HGDH)—that convert (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG, respectively, back to 2OG (Struys et al. 2005a; Steenweg et al. 2010). There is currently no known physiologic role for either enantiomer in normal metabolism.  IDH mutants exclusively produce the (R) enantiomer of 2HG, and the levels of (R)-2HG in IDH mutant tumors can be extremely elevated, ranging from 1 mM to as high as 30 mM (Dang et al. 2009; Gross et al. 2010; Choi et al. 2012). These high levels of (R)-2HG appear to be a consequence of a significant imbalance between (R)-2HG production and metabolism in tumor cells. IDH1 R132H has an estimated catalytic rate (Kcat) of 1.0 × 103 sec−1 (Dang et al. 2009), whereas recombinant D2HGDH has an estimated Kcat of 0.8 sec−1 (Engqvist et al. 2009). It is therefore likely that mutant IDH overwhelms the capacity of D2HGDH to oxidize the excess (R)-2HG back to 2OG. This model is supported by the observation that in patients with type I (D)-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D2HGA), an inborn neurometabolic disorder caused by germline mutations in D2HGDH, levels of (R)-2HG are elevated but to a much lesser extent than is observed in IDH mutant tumors (Wickenhagen et al. 2009). Type II D2HGA, which is caused by germline IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R140G mutations, is associated with higher levels of (R)-2HG and a more severe clinical course (Kranendijk et al. 2010, 2011). Interestingly, D2HGA is not associated with an increased incidence of cancer. It is important to note, however, that many patients with severe D2HGA die in infancy and early childhood, and it is therefore difficult to make definitive conclusions about an association between high levels of (R)-2HG and long-term susceptibility to cancer.  High intracellular concentrations of (R)-2HG are sufficient to mediate the in vitro transforming effects of mutant IDH. Treatment of TF-1 leukemia cells with concentrations of a cell-permeable form of (R)-2HG that achieve tumor-relevant intracellular levels is able to recapitulate the effects of mutant IDH expression (Losman et al. 2013), and treatment of cells with cell-permeable (R)-2HG is able to inhibit the differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and immortalized murine myeloid progenitor cells (Lu et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013). Furthermore, tumor cells that harbor IDH mutations and produce high levels of (R)-2HG appear to require continuous (R)-2HG to remain transformed. Withdrawal of (R)-2HG from TF-1 leukemia cells transformed by cell-permeable (R)-2HG reverses their growth factor independence and restores their ability to differentiate (Losman et al. 2013), and inhibition of mutant IDH1 expression in glioma cell lines that harbor naturally occurring IDH1 R132H mutations impairs in vitro colony formation and in vivo tumor engraftment by the cells (Rohle et al. 2013). Finally, highly potent and specific inhibitors of mutant IDH have been developed that are able to reverse the transformation of TF-1 cells expressing IDH1 R132H and IDH2 R140Q (Popovici-Muller et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013). These inhibitors also induce the differentiation of primary IDH mutant human leukemia cells in vitro and recapitulate the effects of suppression of IDH1 R132H expression in IDH mutant glioma cell lines in vitro and in vivo (Rohle et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013). Taken together, these findings suggest that the transforming activity of mutant IDH is mediated by (R)-2HG and that (R)-2HG is necessary to maintain the transformed phenotype of tumor cells that harbor IDH mutations.  Go to: Mechanisms of transformation by (R)-2HG Several mechanisms of mutant IDH-mediated transformation have been proposed. One model for how mutant IDH contributes to tumorigenesis, and the one that has perhaps gained the most traction since the discovery of (R)-2HG, is transformation by 2OG antagonism. (R)-2HG is structurally and chemically very similar to 2OG (Fig. 2), and it has been proposed that (R)-2HG transforms cells by competitively inhibiting 2OG-dependent enzymes that function as tumor suppressors (Chowdhury et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012; Lu et al. 2012). There are ∼70 known and putative 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in the GenBank DNA database that could be relevant targets of (R)-2HG in mutant IDH-mediated transformation (Table 2).  Table 2. Table 2. List of known and putative 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in the in the GenBank DNA database TET2  The myeloid tumor suppressor TET2 is a particularly intriguing candidate to be a pathogenically relevant target of (R)-2HG in IDH mutant tumors. TET1, TET2, and TET3 are members of a family of 2OG-dependent DNA-modifying enzymes that hydroxylate 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to generate 5-hydroxymethycytosine (5hmC) (Tahiliani et al. 2009; Ito et al. 2010). The TET enzymes are also able to further oxidize 5hmC to generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) (He et al. 2011; Ito et al. 2011). Somatic mutations in TET2, including chromosomal microdeletions and missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, are common in clonal myeloid disorders, occurring in 10%–40% of cases of AML, MDS, MPN, and CMML (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2009; Delhommeau et al. 2009; Tefferi et al. 2009; Couronne et al. 2010; Chou et al. 2011). Interestingly, TET2 appears to be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Although a subset of cases of MDS and AML present with biallelic TET2 loss, the majority of cases present with heterozygous TET2 mutations (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2009; Bejar et al. 2011; Gaidzik et al. 2012). The other TET family members are not recurrently mutated in hematopoietic malignancies, although TET1 is an infrequent MLL fusion partner in rare cases of MLL translocation-positive AML (Lorsbach et al. 2003).  TET enzymes are thought to play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by mediating the demethylation of DNA. The conversion of 5mC to 5hmC and then to 5fC and 5caC by TET enzymes results in the generation of guanine:oxidized cytosine base-pair mismatches. It has been hypothesized that these mismatches are substrates for base excision repair by thymine–DNA glycosylase (TDG) (He et al. 2011; Raiber et al. 2012). It has also been suggested that 5caC residues are substrates for an as yet unidentified enzyme that can decarboxylate 5caC to generate unmethylated cytosine (Ito et al. 2011). In either case, oxidation of 5mC by TET enzymes, followed by TDG-mediated base excision or 5caC decarboxylation, would result in DNA demethylation. Indeed, overexpression of TET2 in HEK293 cells results in decreased 5mC levels and increased 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC levels, whereas knockdown of TET1 in mouse embryonic stem cells results in decreased 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC levels (Ito et al. 2011).  Given the putative role for TET2 in DNA demethylation, it would be expected that loss of TET2 activity should impair DNA demethylation and result in DNA hypermethylation. However, different studies have found inconsistent and even contradictory associations between TET2 mutational status and DNA methylation status in myeloid diseases. One study reported that TET2 mutant AML has a DNA hypermethylation signature (Figueroa et al. 2010). Two other studies found that genomic DNA is hypermethylated in TET2 wild-type myeloid diseases and is hypomethylated in TET2 mutant myeloid diseases (Ko et al. 2010; Perez et al. 2012). In yet another study, 5hmC levels were reported to be lower in TET2 mutant CMML than in TET2 wild-type disease, but global DNA methylation was the same in both cohorts (Yamazaki et al. 2012). In this last study, when locus-specific CpG island methylation was analyzed, only 11 of 27,578 CpG sites were differentially methylated between 5hmC-low and 5hmC-high patient samples. In the 5hmC-low patient samples, of the differentially methylated CpG sites, two were hypermethylated and the other nine were hypomethylated, suggesting that 5hmC levels do not correlate with 5mC levels at all. Some of these inconsistencies may be due to technical differences in experimental approach. It is also possible that TET2 mutations alter the methylation state of DNA at specific loci and only variably alter global DNA methylation.  Although 5mC and 5hmC are the only known substrates of TET2, TET2 may have other hydroxylation substrates besides DNA that mediate its tumor suppressor functions. Moreover, the hydroxylation of 5mC and the oxidation of 5hmC by TET2 might have other functions besides being intermediate steps in DNA demethylation. It has been observed that, in some cells, 5hmC modifications are copied to daughter strands during DNA replication (Szulwach et al. 2011). This requires a considerable expenditure of energy, as the daughter strands would first need to be methylated and then hydroxylated in order to maintain parental DNA 5hmC status. It seems unlikely that there would be significant selective pressure to maintain a nonfunctional transitional state of DNA demethylation. Rather, it seems more likely that 5hmC modifications and perhaps also 5fC and 5caC modifications play specific roles in the regulation of 5mC in the regulation of gene expression, perhaps by serving as recognition sites for the binding of distinct epigenetic and transcriptional regulators. Consistent with this hypothesis, specific “readers” of 5mC, 5hmC, and oxidized forms of 5hmC have recently been identified (Mellen et al. 2012; Spruijt et al. 2013). These include the transcriptional repressor MeCP2, which preferentially binds 5mC and 5hmC; the cell cycle regulator p53, which preferentially binds 5fC; and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, which preferentially binds 5caC. How the binding of these “readers” to modified cytosine residues contributes to the regulation of gene expression is not well understood, but it is likely that any perturbation of these interactions through imbalances in hydroxylation and oxidation of cytosine residues would have profound effects on cellular homeostasis.  There are several lines of evidence to suggest that TET2 is an important target of (R)-2HG in mutant IDH-mediated transformation. The catalytic activity of TET2 is potently inhibited by (R)-2HG in vitro (Xu et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012). Furthermore, IDH mutant brain tumors and leukemias frequently display global DNA hypermethylation signatures (Figueroa et al. 2010; Ko et al. 2010; Turcan et al. 2012). Perhaps the most persuasive evidence for a link between IDH and TET2 mutations is the observation that IDH mutations are mutually exclusive with TET2 mutations in AML (Figueroa et al. 2010; Gaidzik et al. 2012). This suggests that the two mutations act on the same leukemogenic pathways and have redundant effects on cellular transformation. Indeed, (R)-2HG enhances the transforming effects of partial inhibition of TET2. In TF-1 cells, depletion of TET2 induces growth factor independence and blocks cellular differentiation similarly to expression of mutant IDH, and this transformation by TET2 depletion is potentiated by cell-permeable (R)-2HG (Losman et al. 2013).  It is unclear whether TET2 and IDH are similarly linked in other tumors. Depletion of TET2 in immortalized human astrocytes phenocopies the transforming effects of mutant IDH expression, but TET2 mutations have not been described in brain tumors (Koivunen et al. 2012). Interestingly, TET2 promoter methylation is increased in some cases of IDH wild-type grade II/III glioma (Kim et al. 2011). Given that promoter methylation is frequently associated with transcriptional silencing, this suggests that TET2 expression and activity are lost in these IDH wild-type gliomas. Taken as a whole, these observations suggest that loss of TET2 activity by either a loss-of-function mutational event, epigenetic silencing, or inhibition of TET2 activity by (R)-2HG is a frequent and important pathogenic event in brain tumors and myeloid diseases.  The evidence that IDH and TET2 mutations function in the same oncogenic pathway notwithstanding, it is worth noting that the phenotype of the conditional TET2 knockout mouse is quite distinct from that of the IDH1 R132H knock-in mouse described above (Moran-Crusio et al. 2011; Sasaki et al. 2012b). Homozygous deletion of TET2 in the hematopoietic compartment of mice does not cause leukemia but does result in a more significant expansion of hematopoietic stem and early progenitor cells than is seen in IDH1 R132H knock-in mice. Furthermore, TET2-null hematopoietic stem cells have a marked competitive repopulating advantage in transplanted recipient mice when compared with TET2 wild-type stem cells. This increased repopulating activity is not seen with IDH1 R132H knock-in stem cells, suggesting that self-renewal is more markedly enhanced by loss of TET2 than by expression of mutant IDH. TET2-null mice also show granulocyte and monocyte precursor lineage expansion and a skewing of myeloid differentiation toward monocyte/macrophage lineages, phenotypes that are not observed in IDH1 R132H knock-in mice.  There appears to be a dose-dependent effect of loss of TET2 activity on murine hematopoiesis. Mice with heterozygous loss of TET2 show an intermediate hematologic phenotype, with a less dramatic increase in stem cell self-renewal and a less dramatic dysregulation of myeloid differentiation than is seen in the TET2-null mice. This observation raises an interesting point. If transformation by TET2 suppression is indeed gene dosage-dependent, then it is reasonable to assume that selective pressure exists for heterozygous TET2 mutant cells and IDH mutant cells to further inhibit TET2 activity. A heterozygous TET2 mutant clone could do this by mutating the remaining wild-type TET2 allele or acquiring an IDH mutation. An IDH mutant clone could do this by acquiring a TET2 mutation. Why, then, are IDH mutations and heterozygous TET2 mutations mutually exclusive? One possible explanation is that the clonal advantage conferred by loss of TET2 is less dose-dependent in human myeloid cells than it is in mice. A cell that has already partially inhibited TET2 activity by either losing one allele of TET2 or acquiring an IDH mutation might not benefit significantly from further TET2 inhibition. With this in mind, it is interesting to note that, although biallelic TET2 loss is relatively common in MDS, occurring in >25% of cases, complete loss of TET2 is not associated with a more aggressive clinical disease phenotype (Jankowska et al. 2009; Mohamedali et al. 2009; Bejar et al. 2011).  Another possible explanation for the mutual exclusivity of TET2 and IDH mutations in leukemia is that acquisition of an IDH mutation confers a clonal disadvantage to TET2 mutant cells. Cells expressing mutant IDH grow more slowly under optimal culture conditions than their parental counterparts (Seltzer et al. 2010; Bralten et al. 2011; Losman et al. 2013). This suggests that mutant IDH and (R)-2HG have growth-suppressive effects that coexist with their transforming, growth-promoting effects. Perhaps in cells that do not require mutant IDH for cell growth and survival (for example, cells in which TET2 is already mutated), the negative effects of (R)-2HG on proliferation overwhelm the positive effects of (R)-2HG on transformation. This explanation could also account for the less pronounced phenotype of the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice as compared with the TET2 conditional knockout mice. Perhaps the mild phenotype of the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice is not the result of inadequate inhibition of TET2 but rather is a reflection of the balance between the protransforming effects of (R)-2HG inhibition of TET2 and the anti-transforming effects of (R)-2HG inhibition of other, growth-promoting enzymes.  JmjC histone demethylases  The JmjC family of histone lysine demethylases is another family of enzymes that may be a pathogenically relevant target of (R)-2HG. Histone demethylases play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression (Klose et al. 2006; Shilatifard 2006). Histone methylation defines the structure of chromatin, and methylation of some histone residues (H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79) is often associated with transcriptionally active euchromatin, whereas other histone methylation marks (H3K9, H3K27, and H4K20) are usually associated with transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. The patterns of histone methylation at different genetic loci are a function of the balance between the activities of histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases, each of which binds and alters the methylation of specific histone lysine residues. Disruption of histone methylation or demethylation can have profound effects on gene expression, and JmjC histone demethylases have been linked to the pathogenesis of a number of different cancers (Cloos et al. 2008; Varier and Timmers 2011).  Several JmjC histone demethylases appear to function as tumor suppressors. The H3K36 JmjC demethylase KDM2B (JHDM1B/FBX10) is a transcriptional repressor that regulates ribosomal gene expression and represses c-Jun-mediated transcription (Frescas et al. 2007; Koyama-Nasu et al. 2007). Consistent with its putative role as a tumor suppressor, KDM2B expression is significantly lower in brain tumors than in normal brain tissue. The H3K9 JmjC demethylase KDM3B (JMJD1B) is frequently deleted in 5q− MDS and AML (Hu et al. 2001), and the H3K4 JmjC demethylase KDM5C (JARID1C) is occasionally mutated and inactivated in clear cell renal carcinoma (Dalgliesh et al. 2010; Hakimi et al. 2013). The H3K27 JmjC demethylase KDM6A (UTX) and its paralog, KDM6B (JMJD3), can also function as tumor suppressors. KDM6A cooperates with the Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein to enforce cell cycle blockade and also negatively regulates the activity of NOTCH (Herz et al. 2010; Terashima et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010). KDM6B is involved in the regulation of p53 and has been shown to promote the terminal differentiation of glioblastoma cells (Barradas et al. 2009; Sola et al. 2011).  It is possible that inhibition of tumor suppressor histone demethylases by (R)-2HG contributes to transformation by mutant IDH. In fact, (R)-2HG has been shown to inhibit the activity of many 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in vitro, including the JmjC histone demethylases KDM2A, KDM4A, KDM4C, and KDM7A (Chowdhury et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2012). Although the IC50 values for inhibition of 2OG-dependent enzymes by (R)-2HG vary considerably (ranging from 25 μM to >10 mM), it is important to remember that (R)-2HG can accumulate to millimolar levels in tumors. Moreover, overexpression of mutant IDH and treatment of cells with cell-permeable (R)-2HG has been reported to increase H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, and H3K79 histone methylation marks in cell culture models (Lu et al. 2012).  The biological significance of the histone methylation changes induced in vitro by (R)-2HG is not clear, and it is not yet known whether (R)-2HG affects histone methylation in primary human IDH mutant tumors. H3K9 trimethylation is frequently increased in IDH mutant gliomas (Vanneti et al. 2013). However, many IDH wild-type gliomas also display H3K9 hypermethylation, suggesting that aberrant histone methylation is a common finding in brain tumors irrespective of IDH mutational status. In the hematopoietic-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, bone marrow stem cells show a modest increase in methylated H3K4 levels but no change in other histone methylation marks (Sasaki et al. 2012b). Furthermore, no differences in global histone methylation are apparent in the brains of the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice (Sasaki et al. 2012a). Although this could be interpreted as evidence that (R)-2HG does not significantly affect histone methylation in vivo, it is also possible that (R)-2HG induces biologically important changes in histone methylation only at specific genetic loci that promote tumor formation. Histone methylation changes that are beneficial could be preferentially retained in mutant IDH-expressing cells, whereas deleterious changes could be reversed by compensatory changes such as down-regulation of specific histone methyltransferases.  As described above, several JmjC histone demethylases can function as tumor suppressors. However, some histone demethylases are also known to promote tumor growth. Moreover, there are multiple examples of chromatin-modifying enzymes—including histone demethylases and their opposing methyltransferases—that can act as either oncoproteins or tumor suppressors in different cellular contexts (Cloos et al. 2008). It is interesting to speculate that the different functions of the JmjC histone demethylases in different tissues could explain, at least in part, the tissue specificity of IDH mutations in cancer. If the proliferation and survival of a particular cell were dependent on the activity of JmjC histone demethylases that are potently inhibited by (R)-2HG, that cell would likely be relatively resistant to transformation by mutant IDH. Conversely, a cell in which those same JmjC histone demethylases are dispensable for proliferation or have tumor suppressor functions might be particularly vulnerable to transformation by mutant IDH.  EglN prolyl-4-hydroxylases  EglN1, EglN2, and EglN3 are members of a family of 2OG-dependent dioxygenases that regulate the activity of HIF, a heterodimeric transcription factor that mediates the cellular response to hypoxia (Kaelin and Ratcliffe 2008; Semenza 2012). In the presence of oxygen, EglN hydroxylates specific proline residues on HIFα, and these hydroxylated proline residues are then recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3–ubiquitin ligase complex. The VHL complex polyubiquitylates HIFα and targets it for proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, when intracellular levels of oxygen are low, the activity of EglN is inhibited. This permits accumulation of HIFα, which can then heterodimerize with HIFβ, translocate to the nucleus, and activate the transcriptional response of cells to hypoxia. EglN1 is believed to be the principal HIF prolyl-hydroxylase, with EglN2 and EglN3 playing variable compensatory roles in the regulation of HIF in different tissues under specific cellular conditions.  EglN enzymes were initially reported to be inhibited by (R)-2HG (Zhao et al. 2009). However, further study has shown that, on the contrary, (R)-2HG potentiates EglN activity in vitro and in vivo and blunts the induction of HIFα in response to hypoxia in cell culture models (Koivunen et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013). Consistent with this observation, IDH mutant brain tumors display decreased HIF activation compared with their wild-type counterparts (Williams et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012). It should be noted that HIFα levels are elevated in the brains of the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice (Sasaki et al. 2012a). However, these mice succumb at birth to cerebral hemorrhage, suggesting that their brain perfusion during development is abnormal. It is possible that tissue hypoxia, rather than a direct effect of (R)-2HG on EglN activity, is the cause of increased brain levels of HIFα in these mice.  Likewise, there is no evidence that HIF is activated in human IDH mutant leukemias. On the contrary, there is evidence to suggest that activation of HIF inhibits myeloid leukemia. A number of human myeloid leukemia cell lines have been reported to proliferate more slowly and undergo terminal differentiation and apoptosis upon exposure to hypoxia and upon overexpression of HIFα (Huang et al. 2003; di Giacomo et al. 2009; Zhang and Chen 2009; He et al. 2013), and inhibition of HIFα expression by RNAi blocks the differentiation of leukemia cells in response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (Zhang et al. 2008; Zhang and Chen 2009). Moreover, in a mouse model of acute promyelocytic leukemia, exposure of diseased mice to intermittent hypoxia induces leukemia cell differentiation and prolongs survival of the mice (Liu et al. 2006). These observations suggest that HIF may be a tumor suppressor in myeloid leukemia. However, it is not known whether the HIF response to hypoxia is truly blunted in IDH mutant tumors in vivo, as one would predict given that (R)-2HG can serve as an EglN agonist.  The ability of (R)-2HG to function as an EglN cosubstrate appears to play an important role in mutant IDH-mediated cellular transformation. In immortalized human astrocytes, either overexpression of EglN1 or depletion of HIF1α is sufficient to promote soft agar colony formation (Koivunen et al. 2012). Conversely, depletion of EglN1 in mutant IDH-transformed astrocytes inhibits the growth and soft agar colony formation of the cells. Intriguingly, (S)-2HG, which potently inhibits EglN in vitro, is unable to promote transformation of TF-1 leukemia cells. In fact, (S)-2HG antagonizes TF-1 cell transformation induced by TET2 loss (Losman et al. 2013). This is despite the fact that (S)-2HG is a more potent inhibitor of TET2 than is (R)-2HG (Xu et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012). Depletion of EglN1 in transformed TF-1 cells reverses transformation induced by expression of mutant IDH or by depletion of TET2, suggesting that the anti-leukemic properties of (S)-2HG relate to its ability to inhibit EglN1 (Losman et al. 2013). In short, inhibition of EglN1 by (S)-2HG reverses the leukemic transformation that would otherwise ensue as a result of its inhibition of TET2 activity.  Other candidate targets of (R)-2HG  A number of other 2OG-dependent enzymes might be inhibited by (R)-2HG in IDH mutant tumors (Table 2). Three types of collagen hydroxylases—the Leprecan family of prolyl-3-hydroxylases, the P4HA family of prolyl-4-hydroxylases, and the PLOD family of lysyl-5-hydroxylases—all require 2OG for activity, and P4HA1 has been found to be inhibited by (R)-2HG in vitro (Koivunen et al. 2012). The collagen prolyl-hydroxylases mediate the hydroxylation of proline residues required for formation of the collagen triple helix (Gorres and Raines 2010), and the collagen lysyl-hydroxylases mediate the hydroxylation of lysine residues required for collagen cross-linking into stable fibrils (Bank et al. 1999). Interestingly, collagen maturation has been found to be impaired in the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, suggesting that these enzymes are targets of inhibition by mutant IDH in vivo (Sasaki et al. 2012a). Although a role for these enzymes in cancer has not been established, the observation that expression of collagen prolyl-3-hydroxylases and prolyl-4-hydroxylases is down-regulated in many B-cell lymphomas suggests that these enzymes function as tumor suppressors in some tissues (Teodoro et al. 2006; Hatzimichael et al. 2012).  Other potential 2OG-dependent targets of (R)-2HG include FIH1 (factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1), an asparaginyl hydroxylase that regulates the transcriptional activity of HIF (Mahon et al. 2001); the ABH family of DNA demethylases that are involved in DNA damage repair (Lee et al. 2005); and the RNA demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated), which is believed to be important for the regulation of cellular metabolism (Jia et al. 2008; Berulava et al. 2013).  Go to: Other possible mechanisms of transformation by mutant IDH Another proposed mechanism of transformation by mutant IDH harkens back to Warburg's mitochondrial model of oncogenesis. Warburg (1956) hypothesized that the primary defect in cancer cells is impaired mitochondrial function, which causes cells to switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Warburg's model has been somewhat discredited by the observation that mitochondrial function is not impaired in most cancer cells (Wallace 2012). However, there are data to suggest that (R)-2HG directly interferes with normal mitochondrial function. Some D2HGA patients have elevated levels of urinary lactate, suggesting that they have some degree of mitochondrial dysfunction (Kranendijk et al. 2012). Furthermore, the activity of two enzyme complexes in the electron transport chain, complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and complex V (ATP synthase), can be inhibited by (R)-2HG in vitro (Kolker et al. 2002; Latini et al. 2005). Inhibition of ATP synthase expression and activity has been observed in some cancers and is believed to directly promote cellular transformation by causing the accumulation of excess electrons that are then transferred to molecular oxygen to generate superoxide (O2−) (Willers and Cuezva 2011).  Mutant IDH-expressing cells may have an impaired ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Latini et al. 2003). Conversion of 2OG to (R)-2HG by mutant IDH consumes NADPH, and the high catalytic rate of the mutant IDH reaction could conceivably result in depletion of cellular NADPH (Yan et al. 2009; Bleeker et al. 2010). NADPH is the electron donor used by glutathione reductase to regenerate reduced glutathione, which is the principal cellular and mitochondrial antioxidant that regulates cellular redox (Kirsch and De Groot 2001; Block and Gorin 2012). Depletion of NADPH might therefore decrease the ability of cells to neutralize DNA-damaging oxygen-free radicals. NADPH also has other regulatory functions in cells that could contribute to cellular transformation. NADPH plays a role in nutrient sensing and participates in the regulation of the cellular metabolic rate (Newsholme et al. 2010; Newsholme and Krause 2012), and NADPH is also involved in the regulation of thioredoxins, enzymes that regulate the thiol-disulphide redox state and activity of several transcription factors, including NF-κB and AP1 (Arner and Holmgren 2000; Kabe et al. 2005).  Although dysregulation of cellular redox has been shown to contribute to transformation in other types of cancer, it is not clear whether NADPH and ROS are in fact dysregulated in IDH mutant tumors. Consistent with the notion that mutant IDH can perturb cellular NADPH levels, the embryonic brains of the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice have a slight increase in their NADP+:NADPH ratio and slightly decreased levels of reduced glutathione (Sasaki et al. 2012a). However, the brains of the IDH1 R132H mice have lower, not higher, levels of ROS than control mice. In the hematopoietic-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, the NADP+:NADPH ratio and the levels of ROS are normal in the bone marrow (Sasaki et al. 2012b). Despite the apparent lack of increased ROS in the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, it is nonetheless possible that cellular redox dysregulation plays a role in transformation by mutant IDH. The mice may have subtle or compartmentalized, and yet pathophysiologically relevant, perturbations in their brain and bone marrow redox states that only become apparent under conditions of oxidative stress. It is also possible that otherwise normal cells have compensatory mechanisms that largely maintain redox homeostasis in the presence of mutant IDH and that these mechanisms are defective in cancer cells.  Another potential contributor to mutant IDH-mediated transformation is deficiency of wild-type IDH activity. Although most tumor-associated mutations in IDH result in (R)-2HG production, a few rare IDH1 and IDH2 mutants that do not produce (R)-2HG have recently been identified in lymphoid and thyroid tumors (Ward et al. 2012). These mutations are monoallelic and result in either decreased enzymatic activity or loss of expression of the mutant enzyme. It has not yet been determined whether these loss-of-function mutations contribute to cellular transformation or are simply passenger mutations, but they do raise the possibility that IDH haploinsufficiency in IDH mutant cells could be tumorigenic.  Go to: Therapeutic targeting of IDH mutant tumors The observation that (R)-2HG is sufficient to promote cellular transformation and that transformation by (R)-2HG is reversible suggests that inhibiting (R)-2HG production by mutant IDH would have efficacy in the treatment of IDH mutant cancers. In this regard, first-generation mutant IDH inhibitors capable of suppressing the production of (R)-2HG in vitro and in vivo have recently been reported (Popovici-Muller et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013; Rohle et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013).  As described above, EglN activation plays a causal role in the transformation of astrocytes by mutant IDH in cell culture models and appears to play a permissive role in the transformation of TF-1 leukemia cells by mutant IDH. These findings, if proven robust, warrant further exploration of the potential of EglN inhibitors for the treatment of IDH mutant neoplasms. A number of EglN inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of anemia and tissue ischemia, some of which have advanced to human clinical trials (Robinson et al. 2008; Miyata et al. 2011; Sen Banerjee et al. 2012; Forristal et al. 2013).  Finally, it seems likely that the millimolar levels of (R)-2HG that accumulate in IDH mutant tumors also create certain liabilities for tumor cells. For example, inhibition of certain enzymes by (R)-2HG, whether they are pathogenic targets or “bystanders,” might decrease cellular fitness and hence decrease the resistance of cells to certain forms of therapeutic attack. There is some indirect evidence to support this idea. For example, introduction of mutant IDH into TF-1 cells confers a growth disadvantage to the cells under cytokine-rich conditions even though mutant IDH confers a growth advantage to the cells under cytokine-poor conditions (Losman et al. 2013). Moreover, stable expression of IDH1 R132H impedes the growth and migration of human IDH1 wild-type GBM cell lines both in vitro and in mouse xenografts models (Bralten et al. 2011). The relatively good prognosis and enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation therapy of IDH mutant brain tumors might also reflect deleterious effects of (R)-2HG in tumor cells (Houillier et al. 2010; SongTao et al. 2012; Li et al. 2013). Therefore, another strategy for tackling IDH mutant tumors could be to systematically identify and target the unique dependencies that are created in the presence of millimolar concentrations of (R)-2HG, thereby converting the oncometabolite into an Achilles' heel.  Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 were originally identified in glioma,1,2 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasm, and myelodysplastic (MDS) syndrome patients3⇓-5 but are increasingly found in a diverse set of other tumor entities such as chondrosarcoma,6 lymphoma,7 melanoma,8 and thyroid cancer.9 In cytogenetically normal AML, mutated IDH1 is found in 10.9% of patients,10 whereas mutated IDH2 is found in 12.1%.11 Mutations in IDH1 are almost exclusively found at amino acid arginine 132,12 and IDH2 mutations are found more frequently at position R140 and less frequently at position R172.13 All mutations affect the active site of the enzymes where isocitrate and reduced NAD phosphate bind.14⇓-16 Whereas the enzymatic function of mutant IDH to convert isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate is impaired, it gains a neomorphic function to convert α-ketoglutarate to R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG, also known as D-2HG).14⇓-16Genome-wide methylation studies revealed a strong association of mutant IDH1 with an increased number of methylated cytosine guanine dinucleotide (CpGs).17 Similarly, AML patients with mutant TET2 showed a higher number of methylated CpGs, whereas IDH and TET2 mutations almost never occur in the same patient.17 This observation led to the hypothesis that mutant IDH inhibits TET2 function, thus leading to increased DNA methylation and leukemia.17 Indeed, the metabolite 2HG was shown to inhibit the function of TET2, resulting in DNA hypermethylation.18 Many other α-ketoglutarate–dependent dioxygenases and histone demethylases are competitively blocked by 2HG.17⇓⇓⇓-21 Interestingly, a recent study showed that R-2HG, but not S-2-hydroxyglutarate (S-2HG), promotes cytokine independence of a leukemia cell line through activation of the EglN1 prolyl hydroxylase.19,22Several studies suggested that mutant IDH1 and specifically 2HG block myeloid and adipocyte differentiation.17,20 The biological function of mutant IDH1 has been recently studied in a knock-in mouse model, demonstrating an increase in the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells and increased cell proliferation and splenomegaly.23 Mutant mice did not develop leukemia and had a similar survival as wild-type mice, suggesting that mutant IDH1 alone is not sufficient to induce leukemia.23 Potentially collaborating genes in AML patients are mutant NPM1 and FLT3; these mutations frequently co-occur with mutant IDH.24 Xu et al demonstrated that expression of HoxA genes was increased in IDH1 mutated cells.18To identify potentially collaborating partners of mutant IDH1, we investigated the ability of other oncogenes to collaborate with mutant IDH1 in leukemogenesis.Materials and methodsMore information on materials and methods can be found in the supplemental information on the Blood website.Retroviral vectors and vector productionRetroviral vectors MSCV-PGKneo,25 MSCV-HoxA9-PGKneo,25 and pSF91-IRES-eGFP26 have been described previously. pSF91-IRES-eGFP has been modified for Gateway cloning by inserting the RfA cassette (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) as described.27 The 1.2-kb coding region of human IDH1 was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from complementary DNA of bone marrow cells from an MDS syndrome patient with a heterozygous IDH1R132C mutation. Helper-free recombinant retrovirus produced in supernatants of transfected ecotropic Phoenix packaging cell line was used to transduce the ecotropic GP+E86 packaging cell line.28Mice and retroviral infection of primary bone marrow cellsSix- to 8-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany, and kept in pathogen-free conditions at the central animal laboratory of Hannover Medical School. All animal experiments were approved by the Lower Saxony state office for consumer protection, Oldenburg, Germany. Primary mouse bone marrow cells were transduced as previously described.29Bone marrow transplantation and monitoring of miceEqual numbers of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing, sorted bone marrow cells from C57BL/6J mice were injected intravenously in lethally irradiated syngeneic recipient mice that were irradiated with 800 cGy, accompanied by a life-sparing dose of 1 × 105 freshly isolated bone marrow cells from syngeneic mice. Donor chimerism was monitored by tail vein bleeds and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of GFP-expressing cells every 4 weeks as previously described.30 Blood counts with differential white blood cell analysis were performed using an ABC Vet Automated Blood counter (Scil animal care company GmbH, Viernheim, Germany). Lineage distribution was determined by FACS analysis (FACS Calibur; Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) as previously described.29Clonogenic progenitor assayColony-forming cell (CFC) units were assayed in methylcellulose (Methocult M3234; StemCell Technologies, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) as described in supplemental Methods.Patient samples and CD34+ cellsDiagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples were analyzed from 400 adult patients (16-60 years) with de novo or secondary AML (FAB M0-M2, M4-M7) who had entered the multicenter treatment trial AML-SHG 01/99 or 02/95 for mutations in IDH1 as previously described.10 The association of IDH1 mutations with expression levels of HOXA and HOXB cluster genes in adult AML patients up to 60 years of age were studied in 457 patients of the Hemato-Oncology Cooperative study group.31 The association of IDH1 mutations with HOXA9 was studied in an independent cohort.32 In brief, HG-U133-plus2 microarray data of 197 AML patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas Data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/).32 The normalized intensity signals of the 2 HOXA9-specific probes were extracted and log2 transformed. Bone marrow of healthy donors was obtained from the transplantation unit of Hannover Medical School. CD34+ cells were isolated using the CD34 microbead kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Written informed consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was approved by the institutional review board of Hannover Medical School.2-hydroxyglutarate measurementTo determine intracellular R- and S-2HG levels, 5-10 million cells were sonicated for 10 minutes at intervals of 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off at 4°C using the Bioruptor (Diagenode, Liege, Belgium) followed by 2 rounds of freeze–thaw cycles. All analyses were performed on an AB Sciex 4000 Q-trap triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). Liquid chromatography was performed on an Xterra C18 analytical column (150 × 3.9 mm [inner diameter]; 5-μm bead size) with water–acetonitrile (96.5:3.5 by volume) containing 125 mg/L ammonium formate (pH adjusted to 3.6 by addition of formic acid) as mobile phase as described.33Cell-cycle analysis in vitro and in vivoFor cell-cycle analysis, mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with 100 µL 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (1 mM) at 36, 24, and 12 hours before harvest. For in vitro labeling, 10 µM of BrdU was added to 1 million cells for 6 hours. Cell-cycle analysis was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BD Pharmingen, catalog no. 557892).Apoptosis measurementCells were stained with Annexin V-APC and 7AAD according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BD Pharmingen; catalog no. 550474).ImmunoblottingCellular lysates were prepared and immunoblotting was performed as described previously.34 Antibodies and methods are described in the supplemental Methods.Quantitative RT-PCRRNA was extracted and reverse transcribed as previously described.35 Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR was done as previously described using SYBR green (Invitrogen) for quantification of double-stranded DNA on a StepOne Plus cycler (Applied Biosystems).36 Relative expression was determined with the 2−ΔΔCT method,37 and the housekeeping gene transcript Abl1 was used to normalize the results.Methylation analysisGenomic DNA was isolated from cells using the Allprep DNA RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). One µg of genomic DNA was bisulfite converted with the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo Research, Freiburg, Germany). A PCR amplification of 50-100 ng equivalent of the starting amount of converted DNA was performed with C to T conversion-specific primers, cloned in pCR2.1-TOPO sequencing vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced by Sanger sequencing.Gene expression profilingGFP+ cells were sorted from mouse bone marrow cells 4 weeks after transplantation and were hybridized to an identical lot of Affymetrix GeneChips. Further details are described in the supplemental Methods. Gene expression profiling data can be found at the Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number GSE45019).In vitro cytotoxicity assayCells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/mL in flat bottom 96-well plates (100 µL/well) and incubated under light protective conditions. The drugs were added to the culture medium at the specified concentrations. After 64 hours, 10 µL alamarBlue (Abd Serotec, Raleigh, NC) was added per well. Fluorescence intensity was measured after 72 hours on a microplate reader (Safire; Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). All experiments were performed in duplicate with 3 independently transduced cell lines.H2O2 measurementThe measurement of hydrogen peroxide was carried out using the Amplex-red hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay kit as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany).Computational screeningIDH1mut crystal structure in the closed conformation (Protein Data Bank ID code 3INM) was built using Modeler.38 HMS-101 was identified by in silico drug screening of approximately 500 000 compounds against mutant IDH1 using compounds of the ZINC database.39Statistical analysisPairwise comparisons were performed by Student t test for continuous variables and by χ-squared test for categorical variables. The 2-sided level of significance was set at P < .05. Comparison of survival curves were performed using the log-rank test. A binary logistic regression model was used to analyze associations between mutation status of IDH1, NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, and expression levels HOXA9. Statistical analyses were performed with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Munich, Germany), GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA), or SPSS 20.0 (IBM Deutschland, Ehningen, Germany). Graphical representation was prepared using Adobe Illustrator CS5.1 (Adobe Systems GmbH, Munich, Germany).ResultsMutant IDH1 induces a myeloproliferative-like disease in immortalized bone marrow cellsTo test whether mutant IDH1 induces a myeloid malignancy, we cloned IDH1wt and IDH1mut from a patient with MDS syndrome and transduced control (CTL), IDH1wt, or IDH1mut constructs in 5-fluorouracil pretreated bone marrow cells. The cumulative CFC yield from sorted transgene positive cells was not increased and the cells stopped proliferating after the second replating (Figure 1A).Figure 1Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 1 Effect of constitutive expression of mutated IDH1 in primary bone marrow cells in vitro and in vivo.

WB, western blot.We transduced 5-fluorouracil pretreated bone marrow cells with CTL, wild-type, and mutant IDH1 constructs and confirmed transgene expression in bone marrow cells 4 weeks after transplantation (Figure 1B). A high ratio of R-2HG to S-2HG was observed in bone marrow cell lysates from IDH1mut transduced cells compared with IDH1wt , or control cells (Figure 1C). In vivo, when transplanting equal numbers of transgene-positive cells, engraftment in peripheral blood was stable over time (Figure 1D), and complete blood counts (Figure 1E-G), immunophenotype of GFP+ cells in peripheral blood (Figure 1H), and spleen weight at 20 weeks after transplantation (Figure 1I) were similar between CTL, IDH1wt, and IDH1mut mice, suggesting that retrovirally expressed mutant IDH1 alone is insufficient to induce myeloproliferation.To identify other potentially collaborating genes, we compared gene expression levels of known oncogenes between IDH1wt and IDH1mut AML patients. Eight of 11 HOXA cluster genes and 6 of 10 HOXB cluster genes were significantly higher expressed in IDH1 mutant than in wild-type patients (supplemental Figure 1A-B). Overexpression of HOXA9 in IDH1mut patients was confirmed in an independent patient cohort (supplemental Figure 2). HOXA9 was independently overexpressed in IDH1 mutant patients in multivariate analysis including NPM1, FLT3-ITD, and CEBPA mutation status (supplemental Table 1). Because HOXA9 was most differentially expressed between mutant and wild-type IDH1 patients (Figure 2A), and constitutive HOXA9 expression induces a long-latency myeloproliferative disease (MPD) in mice,25,40 we transduced HoxA9-immortalized bone marrow cells with CTL, wild-type, and mutant IDH1 constructs for in vivo evaluation of their leukemogenic potential (Figure 2B; supplemental Figure 3A-B). A high ratio of R-2HG to S-2HG in cell lysates from IDH1mut-transduced cells compared with IDH1 wild-type or control cells confirmed the integrity of our model (Figure 2C).Figure 2Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 2 Mutant IDH1 induces a myeloproliferative-like disease in immortalized bone marrow cells.

(I) Percentage of blast cells in bone marrow of moribund mice (mean ± SEM of the indicated number of mice). (J) Representative Wright-Giemsa–stained cytospin preparations of bone marrow cells from moribund mice (Scale bar: 25 µm in the upper panel; Scale bar: 10 µm in the lower panel). *P < .05; **P < .01; ns, not significant.Equal numbers of sorted, GFP+ cells were injected in lethally irradiated mice with a life-sparing dose of helper cells. Engraftment of GFP+ cells in peripheral blood was higher in IDH1mut-transduced cells at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after transplantation compared with IDH1wt or CTL-transduced cells (Figure 2D). Mice receiving transplants with IDH1-mutated cells developed severe leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia after week 4 of transplantation, whereas blood counts in control mice remained normal (Figure 2E-G). Interestingly, IDH1mut mice died with a median latency of 83 days after transplantation, whereas IDH1wt and CTL mice died significantly later (167 and 210 days after transplantation, respectively; IDH1mut vs IDH1wt, P < .001; IDH1mut vs CTL, P < .001; Figure 2H).At time of death, the majority of bone marrow cells were derived from IDH1- or CTL-transduced (GFP+) cells (supplemental Figure 4A-B). Transduced cells in bone marrow and spleen had a myeloid phenotype predominantly expressing the myeloid marker CD11b and 20% to 30% expressing the progenitor cell marker cKit (supplemental Figure 4C-D). Morphologic evaluation of bone marrow from moribund mice showed that the majority of bone marrow cells had monocytic morphology with an increased proportion of immature cells and slightly more blasts in IDH1mut than in wild-type or CTL mice (Figure 2I-J). Bone marrow cells from moribund mice were readily transplantable into secondary animals with a shorter median survival of IDH1mut compared with IDH1wt mice (supplemental Figure 5). At 2 months after transplantation, no significant difference was observed in GFP+lin−ckit+Sca+ and GFP+lin−ckit+Sca+CD34− stem and progenitor cells from IDH1wt or IDH1mut mice (supplemental Figure 6A-B). Southern blot analysis confirmed full proviral integration for each retroviral construct and showed an oligoclonal disease for IDH1mut mice and a monoclonal pattern for IDH1wt mice (supplemental Figure 7). Thus, mutant IDH1 induced a short-latency MPD-like myeloid leukemia in HoxA9-immortalized bone marrow cells, demonstrating its oncogenic potential in vivo.Mutant IDH1 promotes cell-cycle transitionTo assess the biologic effect of mutant IDH1, we compared cell-cycle phases and rate of apoptosis in mutant and wild-type IDH1 cells. Analyzing GFP+ bone marrow cells from mice at 9 weeks after transplantation, the rate of apoptosis did not differ between mutated or wild-type IDH1 or CTL transduced cells and was similar to the rate of apoptosis in GFP− cells (supplemental Figure 8A). However, the proportion of cells in S/G2/M phases was significantly higher in bone marrow cells transduced with IDH1mut when compared with cells transduced with IDH1wt or CTL (Figure 3A). The quantitative cell-cycle differences for the HoxA9 immortalized mouse bone marrow cells transduced with CTL, IDH1wt, and IDH1mut cells in vivo are summarized in Figure 3B and in vitro in supplemental Figure 8B.Figure 3Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 3 Mutant IDH1 promotes cell-cycle transition independently of 2-hydroxyglutarate.

(D) Methylation analysis of the CpG island in the Cdkn2b (p15) promoter in Hoxa9 cells transduced with IDH1wt and IDH1mut. DNA from in vitro–cultured cells was extracted and bisulfite treated. CpG methyltransferase-treated DNA from IDH1mut cells served as a positive control. The p15 promoter CpG was amplified and subcloned. Twenty clones were sequenced per cell type. Exons are represented by vertical rectangles. White horizontal bars above the exons show CpG islands; black horizontal bars below the exons show the tested region. An open circle indicates a nonmethylated CpG; a black circle indicates a methylated CpG. The percent methylation of the CpG island is calculated by the proportion of methylated CpGs from all investigated CpGs. (E) Methylation analysis of the CpG island in the Cdkn2a (p16) promoter in Hoxa9 cells transduced with IDH1wt and IDH1mut. The analysis was performed as described in the Figure 3D legend. *P < .05; **P < .01; ns, not significant.Gene expression profiles suggested that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors were among the most downregulated genes in IDH1mut cells. We quantified gene expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (Cdkn) 1a (p21), 1b (p27), 2a (p16), and 2b (p15) and found them markedly downregulated in IDH1mut when compared with IDH1wt cells (Figure 3C), providing an explanation for the enhanced cell proliferation in IDH1mut cells. 2HG was previously shown to induce DNA hypermethylation,17 and silencing of CDKN2A and CDKN2B expression by promoter hypermethylation has previously been reported in AML.41 To assess whether Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b expression was downregulated by promoter methylation in our model, we quantified methylated promoter CpGs by sequencing alleles of bisulfite converted DNA. The CpG island in the promoter of Cdkn2b showed low levels of DNA methylation in IDH1wt, IDH1mut, and CTL cells (Figure 3D). The CpG islands in the promoter of Cdkn2a showed low levels of DNA methylation in IDH1wt and CTL cells, whereas IDH1mut cells had slightly increased levels of DNA methylation (Figure 3E). These data suggest that mutated IDH1 enhances cell proliferation through reduced expression of CDK inhibitors; however, transcriptional repression rather than gene silencing by promoter methylation seems to be the mechanism for low expression of CDK inhibitors.Mutant IDH1 activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalingTo identify pathways that are dysregulated by mutant IDH1, we performed gene expression profiling with cells transduced with HoxA9 and CTL, IDH1wt, or IDH1mut. GFP-expressing cells were harvested from bone marrow 4 weeks after transplantation. In unsupervised hierarchical clustering, mutated cells clustered together and separated from IDH1wt or CTL cells (Figure 4A). Differentially expressed genes are listed in supplemental Table 2. We next performed gene set enrichment analysis using the gene sets from gene ontology. Most gene sets were related to membrane receptors, signaling, intracellular organelles and transport, and cell morphogenesis and migration, several of which characterize monocytic function (Figure 4B; supplemental Table 3).Figure 4Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 4 Mutant IDH1 activates MAPK signaling. (A) Row-scaled unsupervised hierarchical clustering of cells transduced with HoxA9 and CTL, IDH1wt, or IDH1mut. Three cell lines per group were generated by independent transductions of bone marrow cells and were transplanted in 1 lethally irradiated mouse each. The cells were harvested from bone marrow 4 weeks after transplantation and were sorted for GFP expression. Gene expression profiling using RNA from sorted cells was performed on Affymetrix Mouse 430.2 arrays. After robust multi-array average normalization, unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed on variance filtered genes based on a log2 interquartile range of 1.6.

(K) Hydrogen peroxide levels in cultured cells of the indicated cells that were incubated with Amplex red reaction mixture for 16 hours (mean ± SEM of 4 independent experiments measured in triplicate). *P < .05; ns, not significant.Genes related to MAPK signaling were highly enriched in IDH1 mutant cells (Figure 4C, P < .001; supplemental Table 3). To identify whether mutated IDH1 perturbs intracellular signaling as indicated by gene set enrichment analysis, we determined the inhibitory effect of 15 drugs that block a specific signaling pathway. IDH1mut cells were resistant to inhibition with the MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126, which inhibits MAPK signaling, whereas inhibition of JNK, p38, NFkB, PI3-kinase, mTOR, PKC, PLC, PKA-CREB, GSK3β, HIF1-α, Hexokinase, and c-Met was similarly effective in IDH1mut, IDH1wt, and CTL cells (Figure 4D; supplemental Figure 9). Further, IDH1mut cells were also resistant to MEK1/2 inhibitors AZD6244 and GSK 1120212 (Figure 4E-F). Protein levels of ERK and phospho-ERK, and specifically the ratio of phospho-p44/total-p44 were highly upregulated in HoxA9 IDH1mut cells when compared with HoxA9 IDH1wt and HoxA9 CTL cells demonstrating MAPK activation on the protein level (Figure 4G-H; supplemental Figure 10). We also evaluated the effect of mutant IDH1 on ERK in bone marrow cells that do not overexpress HOXA9. Transduced cells were transplanted and sorted from bone marrow after 8 weeks. Total ERK was not increased in mutant IDH1 cells. However, the ratio of phospho-ERK to total ERK was higher by trend (P = .05) in mutant IDH1 compared with wild-type IDH1 or control cells for both p44 and p42 isoforms (supplemental Figure 11). We next studied the phosphorylation of downstream and upstream targets of ERK. No difference in phosphorylation levels of Elk-1 and p90RSK (Ser380) was observed between CTL, IDH1wt, and IDH1mut cells (Figure 4I), but phosphorylation of CREB was increased in IDH1mut cells (Figure 4I). Levels of activated RAS and total RAS were similar in CTL, IDH1wt, and IDH1mut cells, suggesting that other signals than RAS activate ERK (Figure 4J). We next assessed whether increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be responsible for MEK/ERK activation in IDH1 mutated cells. Indeed, ROS levels were significantly higher in IDH1mut cells compared with IDH1wt or CTL cells (Figure 4K). In summary, mutant IDH1 is associated with enhanced MAPK signaling, possibly through increased ROS levels, and induces resistance against MEK inhibitors.A novel inhibitor of mutant IDH1 inhibits human AML cell growthBecause inhibition of several signaling pathways did not selectively inhibit IDH1mut cells, we performed a computational drug screen using the ZINC library39 and the published crystal structure of mutant IDH1. By computational screening we identified a potential inhibitor of mutant IDH1 termed 2-[2-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl]ethyl]-1,4-dimethylpiperazine (here termed HMS-101). Computational modeling showed that HMS-101 binds to the isocitrate-binding pocket of mutant IDH1 (Figure 5A). The 50% inhibition/inhibitory concentration for HMS-101 was significantly lower in mouse bone marrow cells transduced with IDH1mut compared with IDH1wt (1 µM vs 12 µM, respectively, P < .001, Figure 5B). Treatment of HoxA9+IDH1mut cells with HMS-101 at 10 µM significantly reduced intracellular R-2HG levels in vitro (Figure 5C). HMS-101 induced apoptosis in IDH1mut cells as evidenced by Annexin V staining (Figure 5D) and cell-cycle analysis by BrDU (Figure 5E-F). Phospho-ERK1/2 and the ratio of phospho-ERK/total-ERK were markedly reduced in IDH1mut cells compared with IDH1wt or control cells, when treated with HMS-101 (10 µM; Figure 5G; supplemental Figure 12). Next, we evaluated the effect of HMS-101 on human AML cells and CD34+ bone marrow cells from healthy donors. Cells were treated in vitro with HMS-101 (10 µM), the highest tolerated dose in normal CD34+ human bone marrow cells (supplemental Figure 13) or solvent control for 72 hours to study the rate of apoptosis, or they were plated in methylcellulose in the presence of HMS-101 (10 µM) or solvent control. The percentage of apoptotic cells in HMS-101–treated cells relative to solvent-treated cells was significantly higher in cells from IDH1 mutant patients (P = .001), but not in IDH1wild-type (P = .9) or CD34+ cells from healthy controls (P = .1), and was higher in IDH1 mutant patients compared with IDH1 wild-type patients or healthy controls (P = .001 and P = .04, respectively; Figure 5H). Colony formation in HMS-101–treated cells relative to solvent-treated cells was significantly inhibited in cells from IDH1 mutant patients (P < .0001), and also to some extent in IDH1wt patients (P = .002), but was not affected in CD34+ cells from healthy controls. Colony formation in HMS-101–treated cells was lower in IDH1 mutant patients compared with IDH1 wild-type and control patients (P = .003 and P < .001, respectively; Figure 5I), suggesting a higher efficacy in IDH1 mutant than in IDH1 wild-type AML. In summary, we identified an inhibitor of mutant IDH1 that shows promising activity in mouse bone marrow cells and in primary human AML cells, suggesting that mutant IDH1 is a relevant and druggable target in AML.Figure 5Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 5 A novel inhibitor of mutant IDH1 inhibits human AML cell growth.

Mutant IDH1 accelerated cell-cycle transition possibly by repression of CDK inhibitors, and enhanced MAPK/ERK signaling. A novel inhibitor of mutant IDH1 decreased 2HG production and inhibited progenitor cells from IDH1 mutated AML patients, suggesting that mutant IDH1 is a relevant and druggable target in AML.In initial experiments, we evaluated the effect of mutant IDH1 alone in vivo. Within 5 months after transplantation, we did not see an engraftment benefit of mutant IDH1 and therefore decided to stop the experiment. Sasaki et al showed that IDH1mut knock-in mice developed splenomegaly and increased levels of hematopoietic stem cells in older mice, but did not die of myeloid disease within 2 years of observation.23 Because of the relatively short observation period in our study, we may have missed such an effect of mutant IDH1. However, we focused on collaborating oncogenes to mimic the physiologic situation in AML patients, where several mutations may co-occur. Based on an initial report that mutant IDH1 was associated with HOX gene overexpression,18 we confirmed this association in 2 large cohorts of AML patients and selected HOXA9 as a potential cooperating oncogene.We found that mutant IDH1 in combination with HoxA9 accelerates the onset of an MPD. Following Bethesda criteria, we termed the disease MPD-like myeloid leukemia.42 The contribution of mutant IDH1 to the disease phenotype seems to be enhanced cell proliferation as evidenced by a rapid increase in white blood cell counts and spleen weight in transplanted mice, an increased proportion of cells in S/G2/M phases of cell cycle in vivo and in vitro, and shorter disease latency in primary and secondary transplants. The frequency of hematopoietic stem cells was similar between mutant and wild-type IDH1 and controls, likely because of the fairly differentiated monocytic phenotype of HoxA9-expressing cells that dominated the morphology of all groups.We observed a slight increase in bone marrow blasts in mutant IDH1 cells, suggesting that mutant IDH1 has an inhibitory effect on differentiation. Previous studies showed that mutant IDH1 blocks myeloid and adipocyte differentiation,17,20 as evidenced by an increased cKit expression in CFCs from mouse bone marrow transduced with mutant IDH2, when compared with wild-type IDH2,17 and reduced lipid droplet accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells transduced with IDH2R172K when compared with either wild-type IDH2 or vector control.20By gene set enrichment analysis in our study, we found MAPK signaling most upregulated in mutant IDH1 cells. Western blot analysis of ERK1/2 and pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK signaling supported activation of the MAPK pathway, whereas inhibition of many other signaling pathways did not show differential sensitivity in mutant or wild-type cells. MAPK signaling was also upregulated in a previous study in melanoma cells ectopically expressing mutated IDH1.8 We found that IDH1mut cells generated increased levels of ROS, which are known to activate MAPK signaling. Previous studies have shown that elevated 2HG levels resulted in increased ROS levels43,44; altered reduced NAD phosphate metabolism resulting from mutated IDH1 could further exacerbate this effect. Two previous studies measured ROS levels in IDH1 mutated cells and did not find elevated levels of ROS.8,23 This discrepancy may be due to different methods that were used in these studies. ROS levels were measured by CM-H2DCFDA staining in the negative studies, which has 35- and 39-fold lower reactivity to H2O2 than to the hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite anion, respectively,45 whereas Amplex red was used in our study reacting primarily with H2O2. Alternatively, ROS levels and MAPK signaling may be increased due to enhanced cell proliferation.46A recent study showed that mutant IDH1 induces cytokine independence in the leukemia cell line TF1. Interestingly, this effect was also seen when cells were treated with R-2HG, but not when treated with S-2HG,22 demonstrating the biologic relevance of R-2HG. To explore whether inhibition of the enzymatic function of mutated IDH1 had antileukemic effects, we searched for specific IDH1 inhibitors using an in silico screening platform. One of our hits with high affinity to mutated IDH1 demonstrated promising activity in vitro on cell proliferation and ERK signaling. The specificity of the IDH1 inhibitor HMS-101 was shown by reduction of R-2HG levels in IDH1 mutant cells. The inhibitor enhanced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation in murine cells and primary AML cells from IDH1 mutated patients. Colony formation was also reduced in some AML patients with wild-type IDH1, but not in CD34+ bone marrow cells from healthy donors. This data suggest that primary AML cells depend on mutated IDH1, that targeting of IDH1 may have therapeutic benefit, and that mutant IDH1 can be effectively targeted in human AML cells.In summary, mutant IDH1 cooperates with HOXA9 to induce a MPD-like myeloid leukemia and enhances cell proliferation possibly through repression of CDK inhibitors. Pharmacologic inhibition of 2HG production inhibits AML cell survival and suggests that mutant IDH1 is a relevant therapeutic target in AML. Mutations in the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are a common feature of a major subset of primary human brain cancers. These mutations occur at a single amino acid residue of the IDH1 active site resulting in loss of the enzyme’s ability to catalyze conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. However, only a single copy of the gene is mutated in tumors, raising the possibility that the mutations do not result in a simple loss of function. Here we show that cancer-associated IDH1 mutations result in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(−)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Structural studies demonstrate that when R132 is mutated to histidine, residues in the active site are shifted to produce structural changes consistent with reduced oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate and acquisition of the ability to convert α-ketoglutarate to 2HG. Excess accumulation of 2HG has been shown to lead to an elevated risk of malignant brain tumors in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism. Similarly, in human malignant gliomas harboring IDH1 mutations, we find dramatically elevated levels of 2HG. These data demonstrate that the IDH1 mutations result in production of the onco-metabolite 2HG, and suggest that the excess 2HG which accumulates in vivo contributes to the formation and malignant progression of gliomas.  Mutations in the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are found in approximately 80% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas in humans 1–3. These mutations occur at a single amino acid residue of IDH1, arginine 132, which is most commonly mutated to histidine (R132H)1, 3, 4. Only a single copy of the gene has been found to be mutated in tumors 1–6. Many of the high grade gliomas with IDH1 mutations are secondary glioblastomas that have progressed from lower grade lesions 1–3, 5. When analyzed in relation to other genes implicated in brain tumors, the compiled evidence suggests that IDH1 is often the first mutation that occurs 2. While these findings suggest that IDH1 mutations are selected for early during tumorigenesis, why mutations in a single allele of IDH1 result in predilection for malignant progression is uncertain. It has been reported that the R132H mutation disrupts the ability of IDHl to convert isocitrate to αKG 3, 7, but the consequences of this impaired enzymatic activity on cellular metabolism have not been systematically analyzed. For example, while R132 IDH1 mutations might reduce the rate of cytosolic αKG production as suggested by others 7, whether IDH1 mutations can influence the enzyme’s ability to act on αKG as a substrate has not been explored. This latter activity may be particularly important for the tumorigenic role of IDH1 mutations since cytosolic αKG is in equilibrium via transamination with the glutamate that plays a unique role in glial cell physiology, and IDH1 mutations are especially prevalent in malignant gliomas.  Go to: Metabolite profiling identifies elevated 2HG levels in IDH1 mutant expressing cells To understand the impact of IDH1 mutation on cellular metabolism, we profiled metabolites to identify changes in metabolite levels in cells expressing R132 mutant IDH1 compared with cells expressing wild-type IDH1. To initiate these studies, we stably transfected U87MG glioblastoma cells, which are wild-type for IDH1, with myc-tagged wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1. Cells expressing either myc-tagged wild-type or mutant IDH1 were used for metabolite profiling experiments (Figure 1a). Metabolites extracted from exponentially growing cells were profiled by liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In initial survey analyses, full-scan LC-MS in negative ion mode (exact mass) was used to examine differences in metabolite species with an m/z between 110 and 1000. Relative quantitative data were collected for approximately 850 ions and identities were proposed by comparison with known human metabolites. Identities of > 100 species identified by a combination of exact mass and retention time match to purified standards were assigned 8. There were no significant differences between cells expressing wild-type IDH1 when compared with parental cells. The levels of most observed ions were also similar between wild type and R132H mutant IDH1 expressing cells (Figure 1b), with no significant changes found in canonical TCA cycle species (P > 0.05 for citrate, isocitrate, αKG, succinate, fumarate, and malate). However, three species were significantly more abundant in R132H mutant IDH1 expressing cells (P < 0.001 for each). The mass of the one of these ions matched precisely to 2HG (expected m/z 147.0299, measured 147.0299). The other ions co-eluted with 2HG, and had masses consistent with the sodium adduct and a dehydrated form of 2HG. Subsequent injection of 2HG standard confirmed a retention time match to the biological peak, and that it forms all three of the observed ions during LC-MS ionization (data not shown). The cellular accumulation of 2HG was quantified by targeted triple-quadrupole LC-MS-MS analysis of cell extracts (Figure 1c). The structure of 2HG is close to αKG, the product of the IDH1 enzyme. Thus, the sole metabolite identified by untargeted metabolite profiling to be markedly altered by R132H mutant IDH1 expression was also implicated by its structure to be IDHl-related.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Cells expressing human R132H IDH1 contain dramatically elevated levels of 2HG The accumulation of 2HG was not restricted to cell extracts as 2HG was found to rapidly accumulate in the medium of cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 (Figure 1d). No appreciable 2HG could be found in the medium of wild-type cells or cells transfected with wild-type IDH1 (Figure 1d). Isotope-labeling experiments on whole cells using uniformly labeled 13C-glutamine as a culture media nutrient demonstrated that the carbons in 2HG are derived from glutamine, with reasonably high overall pathway flux from glutamine through glutamate and αKG to 2HG. Moreover, labeling experiments did not demonstrate any other major alterations in central carbon metabolic flux in cells expressing R132H mutant 2HG (data not shown). The presence of a myc epitope tag did not alter activity of R132H mutant IDH1. Despite being expressed at lower levels than the myc-tagged R132H IDH1, cells transfected with untagged R132H IDH1 demonstrated a comparable increase in 2HG production (Supplementary Figure 1). To determine whether 2HG production in cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 is unique to U87MG cells, we stably expressed wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 in wild-type IDHl-expressing LN-18 glioblastoma cells (Supplementary Figure 2a). Similar to results obtained with U87MG cells, the major difference in metabolite levels observed in LN-18 cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 was an increased level of 2HG (Supplementary Figure 2b).  Go to: Mutant IDH1 directly converts αKG to 2HG The R132H mutation has been reported to result in loss of function for enzyme activity3, 7. However, in these studies only the NADP+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to αKG was assessed. To understand how IDH1 activity is altered in cells by the presence of R132H mutant IDH1, we expressed increasing amounts of wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 separately or in combination and assessed isocitrate-dependent NADPH production and αKG-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates. Consistent with published results, expression of R132H mutant IDH1 resulted in no measurable production of NADPH from isocitrate, and isocitrate-dependent NADPH production increased with increasing amounts of wild-type enzyme (Supplementary Figure 3a, b). The ability of the wild-type enzyme to generate NADPH was decreased slightly by co-expression of the R132H mutant IDH1. Opposite results were obtained, however, when NADPH consumption was measured in the presence of αKG. NADPH consumption by wild-type enzyme was not observed, while R132H mutant IDH1 expression resulted in αKG-dependent NADPH consumption (Supplementary Figure 3c). Although the overall consumption of NADPH was slow, if anything co-expression of wild-type IDH1 with R132H mutant IDH1 facilitated the αKG-dependent consumption of NADPH. These findings demonstrate that in contrast to wild-type IDH1, R132H mutant IDH1 promotes an NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG. Furthermore, as this reduction was not inhibited by co-expression of wild-type IDH1, these data suggest that the novel activity of mutant IDH1 can persist even in the presence of a wild-type IDH1 allele. In fact, it is possible that in the case of a heterodimer of wild-type and mutant IDH1, the αKG and NADPH produced locally by the wild-type subunit could be used as substrates for the mutant subunit explaining the decrease in NADPH production observed in lysates when wild-type and mutant IDH1 are co-expressed.  To understand how R132 mutations alter the enzymatic properties of IDH1, wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 proteins were produced and purified from E coli. When NADP+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate was measured using purified wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1 protein, it was confirmed that R132H mutation impairs the ability of IDH1 to catalyze this reaction3, 7, as evident by the loss in binding affinity for both isocitrate and MgCl2 along with a 1000-fold decrease in catalytic turnover (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 4a). In contrast, when NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG was assessed using either wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1 protein, only R132H mutant could catalyze this reaction (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 4b). Part of this increased rate of αKG reduction results from an apparent increase in affinity for both the cofactor NADPH and substrate αKG in the R132H mutant IDH1 (Figure 2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that while the R132H mutation leads to a loss of enzymatic function for oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, this mutation also results in a gain of enzyme function for the NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG.  Figure 2 Figure 2 R132H mutation alters the enzymatic properties of IDH1 Reduction of the α-ketone in αKG can result in 2HG. To determine whether R132H mutant protein directly produced 2HG from αKG we examined the product of the mutant IDH1 reaction using negative ion mode triple quadrupole electrospray LC-MS. These experiments confirmed that 2HG was the direct product of NADPH-dependent αKG reduction by the purified R132H mutant protein through comparison with known metabolite standards (Figure 3a). Conversion of αKG to isocitrate was not observed. To determine the chirality of the 2HG produced, we derivatized the products of the R132H reaction with diacetyl-L-tartaric anhydride, which allowed us to separate the (S) and (R) enantiomers of 2HG by simple reverse-phase LC and detect the products by tandem mass spectrometry 9 (Figure 3b). The peaks corresponding to the (S) and (R) isomers of 2HG were confirmed using racemic and R(−)-2HG standards. The reaction product from R132H co-eluted with R(−)-2HG peak, demonstrating that the R(−) stereoisomer is the product produced from αKG by R132H mutant IDH1.  Figure 3 Figure 3 R132H mutation in IDH1 results in production of R(−)-2HG To determine whether the altered enzyme properties resulting from R132H mutation were shared by other R132 mutations found in human gliomas, recombinant R132C, R132L and R132S mutant IDH1 proteins were generated and the enzymatic properties assessed. Similar to R132H mutant protein, R132C, R132L, and R132S mutations all result in a gain-of-function for NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG (Supplementary Figure 4). Thus, in addition to impaired oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, one common feature shared among the IDH1 mutations found in human gliomas is the ability to catalyze direct NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG.  Go to: Structural studies revealed a distinct active site of R132H mutant IDH1 To define how R132 mutations alter the enzymatic properties of IDH1, the crystal structure of R132H mutant IDH1 bound to αKG, NADPH, and Ca2+ was solved at 2.1 Å resolution (see Supplementary Table 1 for crystallographic data and refinement statistics). The overall quaternary structure of the homodimeric R132H mutant enzyme adopts the same closed catalytically competent conformation (shown as a monomer in Figure 4a) that has been previously described for the wild-type enzyme 10.  Figure 4Figure 4 Figure 4 Structural analysis of R132H mutant IDH1 Two important features were noted by the change of R132 to histidine: the effect on conformation equilibrium and the reorganization of the active-site. Located atop a β-sheet in the relatively rigid small domain, R132 acts as a gate-keeper residue and appears to orchestrate the hinge movement between the open and closed conformations. The guanidinium moiety of R132 swings from the open to the closed conformation with a distance of nearly 8 Å. Substitution of histidine for arginine is likely to change the equilibrium in favor of the closed conformation that forms the catalytic cleft for cofactor and substrate to bind efficiently, which partly explains the high-affinity for NADPH exhibited by the R132H mutant enzyme. This feature may be advantageous for the NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG to R(−)-2HG in an environment where NADPH concentrations are low. Secondly, closer examination of the catalytic pocket of the mutant IDH1 structure in comparison to the wild-type enzyme showed not only the expected loss of key salt-bridge interactions between the guanidinium of R132 and the α/β carboxylates of isocitrate, as well as changes in the network that coordinates the metal ion, but also an unexpected reorganization of the active-site. Mutation to histidine resulted in a significant shift in position of the highly conserved residues Y139 from the A subunit and K212′ from the B subunit (Figures 4b & c), both of which are thought to be critical for catalysis by this enzyme family11. In particular, the hydroxyl moiety of Y139 now occupies the space of the β-carboxylate of isocitrate.  The electron density in the active site was not sufficient to assign αKG and its orientation unambiguously. We have modeled the substrate based on the available electron density, taking into consideration the coordination between the carbonyl oxygen of αKG and the calcium ion as well as an orientation of αKG that would produce R(−)-2HG, the experimental product. The model required a significant repositioning of αKG compared to isocitrate, such that the distal carboxylate of αKG now points upward to make new contacts with N96 and S94. Overall, this single R132H mutation results in formation of a distinct active site compared to wild-type IDH1.  Go to: 2HG levels are elevated in human glioma samples Our data demonstrate that mutation of R132 can result in the ability of IDH1 to generate R(−)-2HG from αKG. To determine if 2HG production is characteristic of tumors harboring mutations in IDH1, metabolites were extracted from human malignant gliomas that were either wild-type or mutant for IDH1 (see Supplementary Table 2 for summary of tumor characteristics). It has been suggested that αKG levels are decreased in cells transfected with mutant IDH17. We observe that the average αKG level from 12 tumor samples harboring various R132 mutations was slightly less than the average αKG level observed in 10 tumors which are wild-type for IDH1. This difference in αKG was not statistically significant, and a range of αKG levels was observed in both wild-type and mutant tumors (Figure 5). Similarly, a range of levels was observed for other proximal TCA cycle metabolites with no significant differences observed between wild-type IDH1 tumors and tumors with R132 IDH1 mutations. In contrast, increased 2HG levels were found in all tumors that contained an R132 IDH1 mutation (Figure 5, Supplementary Table 2). All R132 mutant IDH1 tumors examined had between 5 and 35 μmol of 2HG per gram of tumor, while tumors with wild-type IDH1 had over 100 fold less 2HG. This increase in 2HG in R132 mutant tumors was statistically significant (p<0.0001). We confirmed that (R)-2HG was the isomer present in tumor samples (data not shown). Together these data establish that the novel enzymatic activity associated with R132 mutations in IDH1 results in the production of 2HG in human brain tumors that harbor these mutations.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Human malignant gliomas containing R132 mutations in IDH1 contain increased concentrations of 2HG Go to: Discussion 2HG is known to accumulate in the inherited metabolic disorder 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. This disease is caused by deficiency in the enzyme 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, which converts 2HG to αKG12. Patients with 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase deficiencies accumulate 2HG in the brain as assessed by MRI and CSF analysis, develop leukoencephalopathy, and have an increased risk of developing brain tumors 13–15.  Furthermore, elevated brain levels of 2HG result in increased ROS levels16, 17, potentially contributing to an increased risk of cancer, and alterations in NADPH metabolism resulting from mutant IDH1 expression could further exacerbate this effect. The ability of 2HG to act as an NMDA receptor agonist may contribute to this effect 16. 2HG may also be toxic to cells by competitively inhibiting glutamate and/or αKG utilizing enzymes. These include transaminases which allow utilization of glutamate nitrogen for amino and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and αKG-dependent prolyl hydroxylases such as those that regulate Hif1α levels. Alterations in Hif1α have been reported to result from mutant IDH1 protein expression 7. Regardless of mechanism, it appears likely that the gain-of-function ability of cells to produce 2HG as a result of R132 mutations in IDH1 contributes to tumorigenesis. Patients with 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency have a high risk of CNS malignancy 15. The ability of mutant IDH1 to directly act on αKG may explain the prevalence of IDH1 mutations in tumors from CNS tissue, which are unique in their high level of glutamate uptake and its ready conversion to αKG in the cytosol18, thereby providing high levels of substrate for 2HG production. Myeloid cells also display a high ability to metabolize glutamine and recently R132 IDH1 mutations have also been described in a subset of AML19. The apparent co-dominance of the activity of mutant IDH1 with that of the wild-type enzyme is consistent with the genetics of the disease, in which only a single copy of the gene is mutated. As discussed above, the wild-type IDH1 could directly provide NADPH and αKG to the mutant enzyme. These data also demonstrate that mutation of R132 to histidine, serine, cysteine, glycine, or leucine share a common ability to catalyze the NADPH-dependent conversion of αKG to 2HG. These findings help clarify why mutations at other amino acid residues of IDH1, including other residues essential for catalytic activity, are not found. Finally, these findings have clinical implications in that they suggest that 2HG production will identify patients with IDH1 mutant brain tumors. This will be important for prognosis as patients with IDH1 mutations live longer than patients with gliomas characterized by other mutations5. In addition, patients with lower grade gliomas may benefit by the therapeutic inhibition of 2HG production. Inhibition of 2HG production by mutant IDH1 might slow or halt conversion of lower grade glioma into lethal secondary glioblastoma, changing the course of the disease.  Go to: Methods Summary R132H, R132C, R132L and R132S mutations were introduced into human IDH1 by standard molecular biology techniques. 293T and human glioma U87MG and LN-18 cell lines were transfected using standard techniques. Protein expression levels were determined by Western blot. Metabolites were extracted from cultured cells and from tissue samples using 80% aqueous methanol (−80°C) as previously reported 8. Metabolite levels in samples were determined by negative mode electrospray LC-MS. For untargeted profiling, extract components were resolved using reverse phase HPLC running and metabolites were detected in ultra-high resolution mode (resolution ~100,000) by accurate mass ion-trap MS, collecting at one scan/second over an m/z range of 110–1100. For targeted evaluation of 2HG, αKG, and other TCA intermediates, extracts were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC system and metabolites detected by triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry, using multiple-reaction monitoring. Enzymatic activity in cell lysates was assessed by following a change in NADPH fluorescence over time in the presence of isocitrate and NADP, or αKG and NADPH. For enzyme assays using recombinant IDH1 enzyme, proteins were purified from E coli using Ni affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Enzymatic activity for recombinant IDH1 protein was assessed by following a change in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm using a stop-flow spectrophotometer. Chirality of 2HG was determined as described previously9. For crystallography studies, purified R132H IDH1 was pre-incubated with NADPH, calcium chloride, and αKG. Crystals were obtained at 20°C by vapor diffusion equilibration using 3 μL drops mixed 2:1 (protein:precipitant) against a well-solution of MES pH 6.5 and PEG 6000. Patient tumor samples were obtained after informed consent as part of a UCLA IRB-approved research protocol, collected by surgical resection, snap frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The IDH1 mutation status of each sample was determined as described previously3.  Go to: Supplemental Methods Cloning, Expression, and Purification of ICDH1 wt and mutants in E coli  The open reading frame (ORF) clone of human isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (cDNA) (IDH1; ref. ID NM_005896) was purchased from Invitrogen in pENTR221 (Carlsbad, CA) and Origene Inc. in pCMV6 (Rockville, MD). To transfect cells with wild-type or mutant IDH1, standard molecular biology mutagenesis techniques were utilized to alter the DNA sequence at base pair 395 of the ORF in pCMV6 to introduce base pair change from guanine to adenine, which resulted in a change in the amino acid code at position 132 from arginine (wt) to histidine (mutant; or R132H), and confirmed by standard DNA sequencing methods. For 293T cell transfection, wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 were subcloned into pCMV-Sport6 with or without a carboxy-terminal Myc-DDK-tag. For stable cell line generation, constructs in pCMV6 were used. For expression in E coli, the coding region was amplified from pENTR221 by PCR using primers designed to add NDEI and XHO1 restrictions sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends respectively. The resultant fragment was cloned into vector pET41a (EMD Biosciences, Madison, Wl) to enable the E coli expression of C-terminus His8-tagged protein. Site directed mutagenesis was performed on the pET41a-ICHD1 plasmid using the QuikChange® MultiSite-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA)to change G395 to A, resulting in the Arg to His mutation. R132C, R132L and R132S mutants were introduced into pET41a-ICHD1 in an analogous way.  Wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in and purified from the E coli Rosetta™ strain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as follows. Cells were grown in LB (20 μg/ml Kanamycin) at 37°C with shaking until OD600 reaches 0.6. The temperature was changed to 18°C and protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to final concentration of 1 mM. After 12–16 hours of IPTG induction, cells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (20mM Tris, pH7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 % glycerol) and disrupted by microfluidation. The 20,000g supernatant was loaded on metal chelate affinity resin (MCAC) equilibrated with Nickel Column Buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH7.4, 500mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and washed for 20 column volumes. Elution from the column was effected by a 20 column-volume linear gradient of 10% to 100% Nickel Column Buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 500 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol) in Nickel Column Buffer A). Fractions containing the protein of interest were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed twice against a 200-volume excess of Gel Filtration Buffer (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris 7.5, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM MnSO4, 10% glycerol), then concentrated to 10 ml using Centricon (Millipore, Billerica, MA) centrifugal concentrators. Purification of active dimers was achieved by applying the concentrated eluent from the MCAC column to a Sephacryl S-200 (GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) column equilibrated with Gel Filtration Buffer and eluting the column with 20 column volumes of the same buffer. Fractions corresponding to the retention time of the dimeric protein were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled for storage at −80°C.  Cell lines and Cell Culture  293T cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagles Medium) with 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected using pCMV-6-based IDH1 constructs in six-well plates with Fugene 6 (Roche) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Parental vector pCMV6 (no insert), pCMV6-wt IDH1 or pCMV6-R132H were transfected into human glioblastoma cell lines (U87MG; LN-18 (ATCC, HTB-14 and CRL-2610; respectively) cultured in DMEM with 10 % fetal bovine serum. Approximately 24 hrs after transfection, the cell cultures were transitioned to medium containing G418 sodium salt at concentrations of either 500 ug/ml (U87MG) or 750 ug/ml (LN-18) to select stable transfectants. Pooled populations of G418 resistant cells were generated and expression of either wild-type IDH1 or R132 IDH1 was confirmed by standard Western blot analysis.  Western blot  For transient transfection experiments in 293T cells, cells were lysed 72 hours after transfection with standard RIPA buffer. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with goat-anti-IDHc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc49996) or rabbit-anti-MYC tag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology #2278) and then detected with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat or HRP-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc2004). IDH1 antibody to confirm expression of both wild-type and R132H IDH1 was obtained from Proteintech. The IDH2 mouse monoclonal antibody used was obtained from Abeam.  Metabolite extraction  48h prior to profiling the appropriate culture medium was changed to identical medium with dialyzed fetal calf serum. All cells were grown in 10 cm tissue culture dishes, and the medium was replaced again with identical medium 24 h and 1h prior to metabolite extraction. All samples were harvested at a non-confluent density (1.5 – 2.0 × 106 cells). Metabolism was quenched and metabolites extracted by aspiration of media and immediate addition of 3.6 mL 80:20 methanol:water at −80°C, and transfer to a dry-ice bed to simultaneously lyse cells and quench metabolism. Cell remnants were scraped from the tissue culture dish and transferred, along with the methanol:water, into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was moved to a new tube. A 1 mL portion of the supernatant was then dried under nitrogen gas, dissolved in 100 μL of aq. LC buffer, spun at 13,000 × g for 10 min to remove any remaining debris and analyzed by LC-MS within 24h, as described below. At the time of harvest, an equivalently treated plate to each of those harvested was used to determine the total cell count, enabling subsequent normalization of LCMS signal intensities between culture dishes.  Non-targeted LC-MS  Samples were analyzed using high resolution (~100,000 fwhm resolution) exact mass ion-trap mass spectrometry in full-scan mode (1 scan/second, set to high dynamic range), coupled to liquid chromatography via negative mode electrospray ionization (−3.0 kV). The scan range was picked to avoid abundant ions like phosphate and sulfate entering the ion trap, and was set as follows: 0–3 min: no scanning, 3–5 min: 85–800 m/z, 5.0–6.7 min: 100–800 m/z, 6.7–9.0 min: 85–800 m/z, 9–16 min: 110–1000 m/z, 16–24 min: 220–1000 m/z. For chromatography, a Synergi Hydro-RP, 100mm × 2 mm, 2.1 μm particle size column was used (Phenomonex, Torrance, CA). Solvent A was 10 mM tributylamine and 15 mM acetic acid in 97% water/3% methanol. Solvent B was methanol. The gradient was (t=0–2.5 min, 0% B; t=5–7.5 min, 20% B; t=13 min, 55% B; t=15.5–18.5 min, 95% B; 19–25 min 0% B). The flow rate was 200 μL/min.  Targeted Liquid Chromatography—Mass Spectrometry, 2HG and TCA metabolite measurements  To detect secreted 2HG in culture media, 500 μL aliquots of conditioned media were collected, mixed 80:20 with methanol, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The resulting supernatant was collected and stored at −80°C prior to LC-MS to assess 2HG levels. To measure whole-cell associated metabolites, media was aspirated and cells were harvested as described above. Two different liquid chromatography (LC) separation methods were used, each coupled by negative electrospray ionization (ESI, −3.0 kV) to triple-quadrupole mass spectrometers operating in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, with MS parameters optimized on infused metabolite standard solutions. In both methods, metabolites were separated by reversed phase chromatography using 10 mM tributyl-amine as an ion pairing agent in the aqueous mobile phase, according to a variant of a previously reported method20. The first method allowed resolution of TCA metabolites: t = 0, 50% B; t = 5, 95% B; t= 7, 95% B; t= 8, 0% B, where B refers to an organic mobile phase of 100% methanol. The second method was specific for 2HG, running a fast linear gradient from 50%–95% B (buffers as defined above) over 5 minutes. In both methods, the column was a Synergi Hydro-RP, 100mm × 2 mm, 2.1 μm particle size (Phenomonex), as above. Metabolites were quantified by comparison of peak areas with pure metabolite standards at known concentration. Metabolite flux studies from 13C-glutamine were performed as described previously21.  Detection of isocitrate, αKG, and 2HG in purified enzyme reactions by LC-MS  Enzyme reactions performed as described in the text were run to completion as judged by measurement of the oxidation state of NADPH at 340 nm. Reactions were extracted with eight volumes of methanol, and centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. The supernatant was dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in H2O. Analysis was conducted on an API2000 LC-MS-MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sample separation and analysis was performed on a 150 × 2 mm, 4 uM Synergi Hydro-RP 80 A column, using a gradient of Buffer A (10 mM tributylamine, 15 mM acetic acid, 3% (v/v) methanol, in water) and Buffer B (methanol) using MRM transitions.  Cell lysates based enzyme assays  293T cell lysates for measuring enzymatic activity were obtained 48 hours after transfection with M-PER lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000g, supernatants were collected and normalized for total protein concentration. To measure IDH oxidative activity, 3 μg of lysate protein was added to 200 μl of an assay solution containing 33 mM Tris-acetate buffer (pH 7.4), 1.3 mM MgCl2, 0.33 mM EDTA, 100 μM β-NADP, and varying concentrations of D-(+)-threo-isocitrate. Absorbance at 340 nm, reflecting NADPH production, was measured every 20 seconds for 30 min on a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), Data points represent the mean activity of 3 replicates per lysate, averaged among 5 time points centered at every 5 min. To measure IDH reductive activity, 3 μg of lysate protein was added to 200 μl of an assay solution which contained 33 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.4, 1.3 mM MgCl2,25 μM β-NADPH, 40 mM NaHCO3, and 0.6 mM αKG. The decrease in 340 nm absorbance over time was measured to assess NADPH consumption, with 3 replicates per lysate.  Recombinant IDH1 Enzyme Assays  All reactions were performed in standard enzyme reaction buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5,10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.03% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). For determination of kinetic parameters, sufficient enzyme was added to give a linear reaction for 1 to 5 seconds. Reaction progress was monitored by observation of the reduction state of the cofactor at 340 nm in an SFM-400 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (BioLogic, Knoxville, TN). Enzymatic constants were determined using curve fitting algorithms to standard kinetic models with the Sigmaplot software package (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).  Determination of chirality of reaction products from enzyme reactions and tumors  Enzyme reactions were run to completion and extracted with methanol as described above, then derivatized with enantiomerically pure tartaric acid before resolution and analysis by LC-MS. After being thoroughly dried, samples were resuspended in freshly prepared 50 mg/ml (2R,3R)-(+)-Tartaric acid in dichloromethane:acetic acid (4:1) and incubated for 30 minutes at 75°C. After cooling to room temperature, samples were briefly centrifuged at 14,000g, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and resuspended in H2O Analysis was conducted on an API200 LC-MS-MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using an isocratic flow of 90:10 (2 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.6:MeOH) on a Luna C18(2) 150 × 2 mm, 5 uM column. Tartaric-acid derivatized 2HG was detected using the 362.9/146.6 MRM transition and the following instrument settings: DP -1, FP -310, EP -4, CE-12, CXP-26. Analysis of the (R)-2HG standard, 2HG racemic mixture, and methanol-extracted tumor biomass (q.v.) was similarly performed. (R)-2HG standard was obtained from Sigma and synthesized internally.  Crystallography  For crystallography studies, purified R132H IDH1 was pre-incubated with NADPH, calcium chloride, and αKG. Crystals were obtained at 20°C by vapor diffusion equilibration of 3 μL drops of mixed 2:1 (protein:precipitant) against a well solution of MES pH 6.5 and PEG 6000. A diffraction dataset with 92% completeness was collected under cryo conditions with 1.08 Å wavelength radiation on an ADSC Quantum 315R detector at Beamline X29A of the NSLS at Brookhaven National Laboratories. The dataset was integrated using HKL2000 and scaled using SCALEPACK22. A single molecular replacement solution was obtained with PHASER23 using published coordinates from wild type IDH1 in the ‘closed’ conformation as search model (PDB accession code 1T0L). Model building was performed using COOT24 and the final model was refined by the CCP4 program REFMAC525; graphics were produced using PyMOL26. Water molecules were selectively modeled into the structure based upon strong spherical electron density difference peaks, having proper coordination geometry and distance, located within the first solvent shell layer, and having B-factors <80 and electron density sigma level >1.0. After the final refinement, 92.4% of residues fit in the most favored regions in the Ramachandran plot, with 6.8% in the additional allowed regions and 0.7% in general allowed regions. The final structure model in the closed form conformation at a resolution of 2.1 Å contains three polypeptide chains of IDH1R132H each chain consisting of 425 amino acids (414 residues plus a C-term His-tag, with residues 4–410 placed into the model), three NADPH molecules, and 301 total waters.  Clinical Specimens, metabolite extraction and analysis  The collection of human brain tumor samples was approved by the UCLA IRB. Human brain tumors were obtained during surgical resection, snap frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Clinical classification and grading of the tissue was performed using standard clinical histopathology as established by the WHO. Genomic sequence analysis was deployed to identify brain tumor samples containing either wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) or mutations altering amino acid 132. Genomic DNA was isolated from 50–100 mgs of brain tumor tissue using standard methods. A polymerase chain reaction on the isolated genomic DNA was used to amplify a 295 base pair fragment of the genomic DNA that contains both the intron and 2nd exon sequences of human IDH1 and mutation status assessed by standard molecular biology techniques.  Metabolite extraction was accomplished by adding a 10× volume (m/v ratio) of −80 C methanol:water mix (80%:20%) to the brain tissue (approximately 100mgs) followed by 30 s homogenization at 4 C. These chilled, methanol extracted homogenized tissues were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 minutes to sediment the cellular and tissue debris and the cleared tissue supernatants were transferred to a screw-cap freezer vial and stored at −80°C. For analysis, a 2× volume of tributylamine (10 mM) acetic acid (10 mM) pH 5.5 was added to the samples and analyzed by LCMS as follows. Sample extracts were filtered using a Millex-FG 0.20 micron disk and 10 μl were injected onto a reverse-phase HPLC column (Synergi 150mm × 2 mm, Phenomenex Inc.) and eluted using a linear gradient LC-MS-grade methanol (50%) with 10 mM tributylamine and 10 mM acetic acid) ramping to 80 % methanohl:10 mM tributylamine: 10 mM acetic acid over 6 minutes at 200 μL/min. Eluted metabolite ions were detected using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer, tuned to detect in negative mode with multiple-reaction-monitoring mode transition set according to the molecular weights and fragmentation patterns for 8 known central metabolites, including 2-hydroxyglutarate as described above. Data was processed using Analyst Software (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and metabolite signal intensities were obtained by standard peak integration methods.  
1752||Introduction Somatic mutations in human cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) were initially found to be recurrent in adult glioma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where the reported mutations were missense and specific for a single R132 residue (Parsons et al., 2008; Mardis et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Initial experiments showed that these IDH1 R132 mutations caused loss of the enzyme's normal ability to catalyze the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. Subsequently, it was discovered that these mutations also conferred an enzymatic gain-of-function: the novel NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to the normally trace metabolite R(−)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) (Dang et al., 2009).  Some gliomas lacking cytosolic IDH1 mutations were later observed to have mutations in IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1 (Yan et al., 2009). These glioma IDH2 mutations were detected at the R172 residue, analogous to IDH1 R132. Mutations in IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 have also been described recently in cartilaginous neoplasms, including chondrosarcoma (Amary et al., 2011). Although initially studies failed to observe mitochondrial IDH2 mutations in AML, prospective metabolite screening of primary AML samples found that 2HG elevation was much more common than expected from the described IDH1 mutational frequency (Ward et al., 2010). Subsequently it was determined that the majority of 2HG-elevated AML samples harbored mutations in IDH2 rather than IDH1. While some of these were R172 mutations, most were unexpectedly found at a different arginine in IDH2's active site, R140.  On the basis of this establishment that multiple residues in the active site of mitochondrial IDH2 can be mutated to produce 2HG, the present study was undertaken to see if additional residues in cytosolic IDH1 had the potential to become neomorphic 2HG-producing alleles. We also investigated the enzymatic activity of additional reported IDH1/2 alterations.  Top of page Results and discussion Mutations at IDH1 R100 and G97 result in 2HG production A metabolite screening test of AML samples established that IDH2 mutations at R140 produce 2HG (Ward et al., 2010). As mutations at two other IDH residues that are analogous to each other, mitochondrial IDH2 R172 and cytosolic IDH1 R132, both lead to 2HG production, we asked whether the same relationship held between known neomorphic mutations at IDH2 R140 and mutations at the uncharacterized analogous position in IDH1, R100. Like IDH2 R140, IDH1 R100 normally stabilizes isocitrate's β-carboxyl group through a charge interaction from its guanidinium moiety (Figure 1a). We predicted that removing this stabilization of the β-carboxyl through mutation of R100 would hinder the enzyme's ability to use isocitrate as a substrate and, like the mutation of IDH2 R140, facilitate the non-carboxylating reduction of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG. The effect of IDH1 G97D mutation was also examined, as this alteration has been identified in colon cancer cell lines and pediatric glioblastoma (Bleeker et al., 2009; Paugh et al., 2010), and we predicted that this mutation to a negatively charged aspartate would disfavor coordination of isocitrate's negatively charged β-carboxyl. Figure 1. Figure 1 - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Mutation of IDH1 R100 or G97 leads to 2HG production. (a) The active site of human IDH2, modeled based on the highly homologous porcine-IDH2 structure (Ceccarelli et al., 2002), and the active site of crystallized human IDH1 with isocitrate are shown. Isocitrate carbons are yellow, except the β-carboxyl carbon in cyan. Also shown are oxygens (red), amines (blue) and carbons of amino acids (green). Dashed lines represent hydrogen and ionic bonds <3.1 Å. The prime (′) designates residues from the other monomer of the IDH dimer. Modeling of human IDH2 was performed as described previously (Ward et al., 2010) and images were generated using PyMOL viewer (DeLano, 2006). (b) 293T cells were lysed 48 h after transfection with IDH1 WT, mutants or empty vector, and IDH1 expression was confirmed by western blot with goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc49996, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). S6 ribosomal protein levels were measured to assess equal loading with rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA, 2217). These lysates were then assayed for isocitrate-dependent NADPH production from 3 μg lysate protein in an assay solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1.3 mm MnCl2, 0.33 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm β-NADP+ and 0.1 mm d-(+)-threo-isocitrate as described previously (Ward et al., 2010). Data are depicted as the mean and s.d. from three independent measurements at the indicated time points. (c) Parallel-transfected cells were extracted for intracellular metabolites by gently removing the culture medium and then rapidly quenching the cells in ice-cold 80% methanol. After incubation at −80 °C for 20 min, extracts were centrifuged to remove precipitated protein, and aqueous metabolites in the supernatant were dried under nitrogen gas and redissolved in 1:1 acetonitrile:N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA; Regis, Morton Grove, IL, USA) and heated at 70 °C for 75 min to derivatize metabolites. Derivatized samples were then analyzed by GC–MS as described previously (Ward et al., 2010). Representative gas chromatographs are shown for metabolites eluting from 31 to 33.5 min, including glutamate (Glu) and 2HG. Metabolite abundance refers to signal intensity. Data for (b) and (c) are from a representative of three independent experiments.  Full figure and legend (236K)  To test our predictions, we expressed IDH1 R100A and IDH1 G97D mutants in cells, along with IDH1 WT and the established 2HG-producing IDH1 R132H mutant (Figure 1b). We first found that, unlike the overexpression of IDH1 WT, expression of either IDH1 R100A or G97D failed to increase isocitrate-dependent NADPH production in cell lysates above the levels in vector-transfected cells. Thus, like the IDH1 R132H mutation shown previously (Dang et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009), IDH1 R100A and G97D mutations show loss-of-function for generating NADPH in the presence of isocitrate. To determine if the R100A and G97D mutants also share with the R132H mutant the gain-of-function to produce 2HG, we extracted metabolites from parallel-transfected cells and measured 2HG elevation by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). 2HG levels were observed to be elevated in cells expressing either IDH1 R100A or G97D (Figure 1c). As a confirmation, we found that 2HG was also elevated in the HCT15 colon cancer line containing an endogenous G97D mutation (data not shown). Of note, following the initiation of this study, IDH1 mutations at R100 were described in adult glioma (Pusch et al., 2011), further supporting the importance of predicting and then characterizing additional 2HG-producing alleles.  Electrostatic analysis predicts another 2HG-producing mutation: IDH1 Y139D To better understand the loss of isocitrate utilization and gain of 2HG production from IDH1 R132H, R100A and G97D mutations, we performed an electrostatic analysis to calculate the destabilizing effect of each mutation on isocitrate's β-carboxyl (Figure 2a). Consistent with IDH1 R132H, R100A and G97D mutations all favoring conversion of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG rather than interconversion of α-ketoglutarate and isocitrate, all three mutations were found to be unfavorable for isocitrate β-carboxyl stabilization. While performing this analysis, we also examined if mutations at other IDH1 active site residues could be predicted to disfavor coordination of the isocitrate β-carboxyl. Surprisingly, we found that an additional mutation, Y139D, could be modeled to have an electrostatic effect comparable to that for the 2HG-producing mutant G97D. As Y139 is located near the substrate in the IDH1 active site (Figure 1a), we investigated whether IDH1 Y139D could be yet another 2HG-producing neomorph. We first found that Y139D mutant overexpression failed to increase isocitrate-dependent NADPH production from cell lysates, similar to R132H mutant overexpression and in contrast to cells overexpressing IDH1 WT (Figure 2b). From parallel-transfected cells, we then assessed whether IDH1 Y139D could produce 2HG. Unlike cells expressing IDH1 WT, cells expressing the predicted Y139D mutant displayed 2HG elevation (Figure 2c). Figure 2.

If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author The predicted Y139D mutation of IDH1 is another 2HG-producing allele. (a) The changes in electrostatic interaction energy with isocitrate's β-carboxyl group were calculated for various IDH1 mutations relative to wild type. A positive change in energy indicates decreased stabilization of the β-carboxylate in both the isocitrate–IDH1 complex and in the transition state of the α-ketoglutarate right arrow isocitrate reverse reaction, thus favoring the production of 2HG product, which lacks this carboxylate. Mutations were modeled using the structure PDB ID 1T0L of wild-type human IDH1 in complex with NADPH, isocitrate and calcium as the template (Xu et al., 2004). Details for modeling and electrostatic interaction calculations are described in Supplementary Materials and Methods. (b) 293T cells were lysed 48 h after transfection with IDH1 WT, Y139D or R132H, or empty vector. IDH1 protein levels were assessed by western blot and 3 μg of lysate protein was assessed for NADPH production with 0.1 mm isocitrate. (c) Parallel-transfected cells were extracted for intracellular metabolites and analyzed by GC–MS. Data for (b) and (c) are from a representative of three independent experiments.  Full figure and legend (132K)  Although the mutation of IDH1 Y139 is yet to be described in any cancer, the residue does lie outside IDH1's fourth exon, which has been the region of exclusive focus in many sequencing studies. The lack of samples, to date, with reported mutation of IDH1 Y139 (or the analogous IDH2 Y179) may also be structurally explained by the strict requirement for this position to incorporate a negatively charged residue in order to facilitate neomorphic enzyme activity (Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, for the commonly affected residues IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172 and IDH2 R140, the diversity of substitutions observed suggests a less-specific structural requirement. Still, specific substitutions of IDH1 R132H/C, IDH2 R172K and IDH2 R140Q are observed with higher frequency. These can all arise through C  right arrow T or G right arrow A transitions in CpG dinucelotides at these codons, potentially from the frequent methylation-induced deamination of 5-methylcytosine (Cooper and Youssoufian, 1988), in contrast to IDH1 Y139D, where a T right arrow G transversion must occur at a non-CpG site.  Top of page All IDH mutations specifically produce the (R) enantiomer of 2HG Although recent investigations have focused on the differing biological effects of the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 2HG, IDH R132 mutations were shown to exclusively produce R(−)-2HG both in vitro and in primary tumor tissue (Dang et al., 2009), and the same stereospecificity was shown for both R172 and R140 mutations in IDH2 (Kranendijk et al., 2010; Ward et al., 2010). Somatic mutations in tumors resulting in the elevation of S(+)-2HG are yet to be found. To determine the chirality of 2HG produced by the additional IDH neomorphs identified in this study, we used a previously described procedure to separate the (S) and (R) enantiomers of 2HG by GC-MS (Kamerling et al., 1981; Ward et al., 2010). We determined that like in cells expressing IDH1 R132H, the 2HG produced in cells expressing IDH1 R100A, G97D or Y139D specifically corresponds to the (R) enantiomer (Figure 3).  Figure 3. Figure 3 - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author All IDH1 mutants specifically generate 2HG's (R) enantiomer. (a) Separation of the two stereoisomers of 2HG on GC–MS as the O-acetylated di(−)-2-butyl esters was shown using standards obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA) and purified by elution from an AG-1 X8 100–200 anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). A previously described extended derivatization procedure was then performed (Kamerling et al., 1981; Ward et al., 2010). Eluates were dried under nitrogen, redisssolved in 1 m HCl in R(−)-2-butanol and heated for 3 h at 95 °C. After drying again under nitrogen, samples were redissolved in pyridine and acetic anhydride at a 1:1 ratio, heated for 30 min at 100 °C, dried and redissolved in acetonitrile before analysis of the ion at m/e− 173 by GC–MS. (b) Cells expressing IDH1 R132H, R100A, G97D or Y139D were analyzed by the same method to determine the specific 2HG enantiomer produced by each mutant. Data are from a representative of three independent experiments.  Full figure and legend (49K)  Rare recurring mutations in lymphoma and thyroid cancer do not produce 2HG, but can result in loss-of-function At the time of this article's submission, over 100 papers had been published that reported patient samples containing tumor-specific IDH mutations. More than 99% of these patient samples have an IDH1/2 mutation that has now been confirmed to be R(−)-2HG-producing, either from this or previous studies (Supplementary Table 2). However, several reports have recently identified IDH1/2 variants that are yet to be enzymatically characterized (Table 1). We first examined the effects of reported IDH1 SNPs, V71I and V178I, as well as non-arginine variants only reported in a single sample to date (Hemerly et al., 2010; Ho et al., 2010; Marcucci et al., 2010; Murugan et al., 2010; Zou et al., 2010; Forbes et al., 2011; Rakheja et al., 2011). All were expressed at comparable levels to IDH1/2 WT in cells (Supplementary Figure 1). None were observed to increase intracellular 2HG, whereas all retained the ability to increase isocitrate-dependent NADPH production from cell lysates. Table 1 - Summary of the effect of IDH mutations on enzyme expression and activity. Table 1 - Summary of the effect of IDH mutations on enzyme expression and activity - Unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. If you require assistance to access this image, please contact help@nature.com or the author Full table  In addition to these variants, which we found to behave like wild-type IDH enzymes, we also investigated several rare yet recurring somatic mutations. Although previously undescribed in cancer, we have found somatic mutations at IDH2 F394 in two T-cell angioimmunoblastic lymphoma (AILT) samples (one sample with IDH2 F394I and one with F394V). By transfection we were unable to express these mutants, despite achieving comparable levels of IDH2 mRNA in the transfected cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Transfection of these mutants did not elevate intracellular 2HG, and we confirmed that their transfection did not increase isocitrate-dependent NADPH production.  We then investigated IDH1 G70D and A134D mutations described in six and two thyroid cancer samples, respectively, as well as an IDH1 R49C mutation described in one pediatric glioblastoma (Hemerly et al., 2010; Paugh et al., 2010). All of these mutations have been shown to occur at a single allele in a somatic manner. Only the IDH1 A134D mutant could be effectively overexpressed to levels comparable to IDH1 WT or R132H, despite a clear increase in IDH1 mRNA levels for all mutant-transfected cells (Supplementary Figure 3). While not producing 2HG, the expressed A134D mutant also failed to increase isocitrate-dependent NADPH production. Together these data suggest that there is a subset of rare IDH somatic mutations that result in decreased wild-type activity without a concomitant increase in 2HG production.  As retention of at least one wild-type IDH allele is important for proliferation in MYC-driven cancer cells and for IDH1/2-mediated shuttling of NADPH from the mitochondria to cytoplasm (Lemons et al., 2010; Ward et al., 2010), we examined if the expressed but loss-of-function A134 mutant IDH1 could dominantly inhibit IDH1 WT activity in cells. For the 2HG-producing mutant IDH1 R132H, it was shown first by Dang et al. (2009), testing a range of physiological isocitrate concentrations up to 100 μm, that R132H mutant expression does not substantially inhibit the isocitrate-dependent NADPH production of IDH1 WT, a finding recently confirmed extensively by an independent group (Jin et al., 2011). We repeated this analysis for IDH1 A134D. Co-transfecting IDH1 A134D with IDH1 WT at either a 1:1 or a 3:1 ratio, we did not observe a decrease in isocitrate-dependent NADPH production from transfection of the A134D mutant (Supplementary Figure 4).  For the IDH1 G70D, IDH1 R49C and IDH2 F394I/V mutants that could not be effectively overexpressed in cells, we performed in vitro transcription-coupled translation with [35S]-methionine and rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Supplementary Figure 5). We found that in vitro transcription/translation of IDH1 G70D or IDH1 R49C generated a major band corresponding to the predicted IDH1 molecular weight of 47 kDa, matching the product observed from IDH1 WT. Similarly, we found that in vitro transcription/translation of IDH2 F394I or F394V generated a major band, matching that produced from IDH2 WT. These results further indicate that the inability of these mutants to be effectively overexpressed following transfection reflects an impairment in cellular accumulation.  No IDH mutations producing 2HG have been confirmed to date in thyroid cancer. Conversely, none of the recurring but non-2HG-producing somatic mutations found in thyroid cancer or AILT have ever been described in leukemia or adult glioma. We further confirmed in this study, in 973 myeloid hematologic malignancy samples, that no recurring somatic mutations were found between IDH1 residues 41-438 or IDH2 residues 125-226 except for the previously characterized 2HG-producing IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172K and IDH2 R140Q alleles. Full-length sequencing of the entire IDH1/2 coding regions in 20 samples also failed to detect any additional somatic alterations.  These data support the neomorphic activity converting α-ketoglutarate to R(−)-2HG, rather than solely the loss of normal IDH function, being the common feature selected for in adult leukemia, glioma and the vast majority of other IDH1/2 mutant cancers. This is further evidenced by recent work showing the clustering of R(−)-2HG-producing IDH mutant cases in a distinct DNA hypermethylation signature in tumor samples from both glioma and AML patients (Figueroa et al., 2010; Noushmehr et al., 2010). While those rare IDH mutations indicative of IDH haploinsufficiency in AILT and thyroid cancer require further investigation and may potentially result in impairment of cytosolic NADPH production and redox control, any of the residues in cytosolic IDH1 or mitochondrial IDH2 that can be altered to produce the R(−)-2HG oncometabolite can be screened for their mutation by a GC–MS metabolite assay.  The data presented here suggest that a screening and diagnostic approach based on elevated oncometabolite levels may not be of the highest utility for thyroid cancer, as IDH mutations found to date in thyroid cancer do not produce 2HG and may function to promote tumorigenesis in an alternative manner. However, on the basis of this study there are at least five reproducible cancer-associated mutations that can result in 2HG production and these appear to be selected for in several well-characterized tumor types including AML, gliomas, chondrosarcomas and gastrointestinal cancers. Thus, a screening and diagnostic approach for these malignancies based on elevated 2HG levels may be of substantial value. First, given the rarity and marked developmental consequences of inborn errors of metabolism leading to elevated 2HG, tumors displaying increased levels of 2HG are unlikely to be false positives, in contrast to conventional gene sequencing, in which numerous SNPs and uncharacterized sequencing artifacts and/or passenger alterations that have no effect on IDH enzyme activity are detected. Screening for elevated 2HG levels may also be a more sensitive test, as it can allow for the detection of neomorphic mutations at residues like IDH1 R100, G97 and Y139 that are not normally examined by sequencing or mutation-specific antibody approaches focused on the most common alleles. Finally, screening for 2HG can be non-invasive: patient sera/plasma can be assayed in the case of leukemia, whereas radiological approaches for 2HG detection can be refined in the case of glioma and other solid tumors, and urinalysis may also be employed.  Overall, the data presented here show the complexity inherent in correlating the genetic alterations in the IDH1/2 enzymes found in sequencing studies with altered metabolic activity. Most IDH mutant tumor samples reported to date harbor a mutation which has now been shown to be R(−)-2HG producing, based on the work of this study and others. Yet, we also report here the existence of rare subsets of IDH loss-of-function mutations that do not produce 2HG. Taken together, these data highlight the value of metabolite screening approaches to more specifically and sensitively identify those IDH mutant tumors that harbor elevations in the level of the R(−)-2HG oncometabolite. 
1754||Current genomic and biochemical analysis revealed mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes associated with several neoplasms and a novel enzymatic activity of IDH mutations to catalyze α-ketoglutarate to d-2-hydroxyglutarate, contributing to tumorigenesis. We identified a broad range of IDH1 mutations, including a previously unidentified IDH1-R132Q mutation, in cartilage tumors. Cartilage-specific Col2a1-Cre/ERT2;Idh1-R132 mutant knock-in mice developed multiple enchondroma-like lesions. These data show that mutant Idh in growth-plate cells causes persistence of chondrocytes, giving rise to enchondromas adjacent to the growth cartilage in bone.  Keywords: isocitrate dehydrogenase, cartilage tumor, hedgehog Go to: ABSTRACT Enchondromas are benign cartilage tumors and precursors to malignant chondrosarcomas. Somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes (IDH1 and IDH2) are present in the majority of these tumor types. How these mutations cause enchondromas is unclear. Here, we identified the spectrum of IDH mutations in human enchondromas and chondrosarcomas and studied their effects in mice. A broad range of mutations was identified, including the previously unreported IDH1-R132Q mutation. These mutations harbored enzymatic activity to catalyze α-ketoglutarate to d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG). Mice expressing Idh1-R132Q in one allele in cells expressing type 2 collagen showed a disordered growth plate, with persistence of type X-expressing chondrocytes. Chondrocyte cell cultures from these animals or controls showed that there was an increase in proliferation and expression of genes characteristic of hypertrophic chondrocytes with expression of Idh1-R132Q or 2HG treatment. Col2a1-Cre;Idh1-R132Q mutant knock-in mice (mutant allele expressed in chondrocytes) did not survive after the neonatal stage. Col2a1-Cre/ERT2;Idh1-R132 mutant conditional knock-in mice, in which Cre was induced by tamoxifen after weaning, developed multiple enchondroma-like lesions. Taken together, these data show that mutant IDH or d-2HG causes persistence of chondrocytes, giving rise to rests of growth-plate cells that persist in the bone as enchondromas.  Enchondromas, one of the most common benign tumors occurring in bone, are present in more than 3% of the population (1, 2). They are composed of cells derived from chondrocytes and occur as solitary lesions or multiple lesions in enchondromatosis syndromes (Ollier disease or Maffucci syndrome—in the latter, enchondromas are associated with vascular malformations). Clinical problems caused by enchondromas include pain, fractures, and skeletal deformity. There is a potential for malignant progression to chondrosarcoma that may be greater than 50% in some cases of multiple enchondromatosis (i.e., Maffucci syndrome) (3–7). Many chondrosarcomas are thought to derive from enchondromas, and such sarcomas are termed central chondrosarcomas (3).  The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is constitutively active in enchondromas and chondrosarcomas (8, 9). Hh is important in growth-plate chondrocyte differentiation, where it cooperates with parathyroid hormone-like hormone in a negative feedback loop to inhibit the differentiation of proliferative growth-plate chondrocytes (6, 10–14). Disruption of this feedback loop can result in either skeletal dysplasias with abnormal bone growth or enchondromas; 5% of enchondromas harbor mutation in parathyroid hormone-like hormone receptor (PTHR1), resulting in activation of Hh signaling (6, 10–14), and expression of a mutant PTHR1 or overexpression of the Hh-regulated transcription factor Gli2 under the Col2a1 promoter causes enchondroma-like cartilage lesions to develop adjacent to the growth-plate cartilage in mice (8).  The majority of enchondromas and chondrosarcomas harbor somatic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or IDH2 mutations (15–18). Mutations in IDH genes are common in several other neoplasms, including glioma, glioblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, angioimmunoblatic T-cell lymphoma, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (19–22). Biochemical studies in these cancer types identified a neomorphic enzymatic activity of the mutant IDH that converts α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG), which builds up to high concentrations in IDH mutant cells. d-2HG can competitively inhibit the function of a large group of α-KG–dependent enzymes and thereby, modulate a number of cellular processes, including DNA methylation, histone methylation, and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (23–25). However, how IDH mutations contribute to enchondroma and chondrosarcoma tumorigenesis is unclear.  We previously established tissue-specific Idh1 mutant knock-in (KI) mice and reported the pathological phenotypes in the hematopoietic system and the brain. Specifically, the Idh1-KI mutant mouse lines showed brain hemorrhage, increased numbers of early hematopoietic progenitors, and anemia with extramedullary hematopoiesis, which is known to progress to acute myeloid leukemia (26, 27). Here, we generated cartilage-specific Idh1-KI mice to examine the effect of mutant Idh1 on the differentiation of chondrocytes and the development of cartilaginous neoplasia.  Go to: RESULTS Human Enchondromas and Chondrosarcomas Have a Broad Variety of IDH Mutations That Results in d-2HG Production. To identify the range of IDH mutations in cartilage tumors, we assessed the presence of mutations in a cohort of 43 chondrosarcomas and 13 enchondromas. Sanger sequencing was used to genotype the tumor samples. Sequencing showed that 20 of the chondrosarcomas and 8 of the enchondromas harbored an IDH mutation. We confirmed the somatic nature of the mutations by comparing with the germ line of the patients, finding a wild-type (WT) sequence in the germ line in all cases. The most frequent mutation in IDH1 was R132C followed by R132G, R132L, R132H, and R132Q (Fig. 1A and Tables 1 and and2).2). This distribution is a broader range of IDH1 mutations than previously identified, although all of the mutations change the same amino acid residue. We further examined whether this IDH1 mutation results in the acquisition of the altered enzymatic activity capable of converting α-KG to d-2HG before conducting experiments in a genetically engineered mouse model. To quantify the d-2HG–producing neoactivity compared with a known human oncogenic mutation, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) consumption was measured using recombinant mouse IDH1-R132Q, the well-characterized human IDH1-R132H, and the WT IDH1 protein. The results revealed that the R132Q mutation confers the same neoactive ability to produce d-2HG as previously reported for R132H and other IDH1 and IDH2 oncogenic mutations (Fig. 1B and Table 3) (28). To further examine this mutation in a cell-based assay, HEK293T cells were transfected with mouse R132H, R132Q, and WT IDH1. d-2HG was greatly elevated in the culture media of both IDH1 R132Q and IDH1 R132H but not in WT IDH1-overexpressing HEK293T cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, for all tumor-associated amino acid substitutions described to date, including the previously undescribed R132Q, a mutation of IDH1 at R132 causes a gain of function that produces d-2HG.  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. IDH1 R132Q mutations confer an enzymatic activity that converts α-KG to d-2HG.

Kinetic parameters of IDH1 R132Q and R132H Mutant Idh1 Disrupts Growth-Plate Structure. To determine how mutant Idh alters chondrocyte function in vivo, we generated conditional Idh1-KI mutant mice. A conditional Idh1-KI mouse line previously generated (29) was crossed with Col2a1-Cre transgenic mice to generate the KI mice. Unexpectedly, Col2a1-Cre;Idh1-KI pups were rarely found alive after birth. Even if the mutant mice did survive after birth, they died before weaning (Table S1). Because other cartilage-specific mutant mice are known to have dysfunction of the respiratory system, rib cage and tracheal cartilage were examined by whole-mount skeletal staining with alcian blue and alizarin red. This approach showed dwarfism in Idh1 mutant mice as well as pectus excavatum characterized by a caved-in or sunken appearance of the chest and dysplasia of tracheal cartilage (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1). These changes likely caused the early deaths in these mutant mice.  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Col2a1-Cre;Idh1-KI mice showed impaired chondrocyte differentiation. (A) Whole-mount skeletal staining with alcian blue and alizarin red in Col2a1-Cre;Idh1-KI mutant and WT littermates. Arrowhead shows pectus excavatum in the mutant mice. (B) d-2HG levels ... The Col2a1-Cre;Idh1-KI mice showed high levels of d-2HG in analysis of their limbs, whereas control mice did not (Fig. 2B). Histological analysis of the tibia showed reduced cartilage mineralization in the middle section (Fig. 2C). These mice also exhibited a disrupted columnar structure of proliferative chondrocytes, especially in the middle of the growth plate, with ectopic expression of Col10a1 (Fig. 2 D and E). This latter phenotype could be detected from embryonic day (E) 16.5 to day 0 after birth (Fig. S2). This region of the growth plate is reported to be hypoxic, and similar disruption of columnar structure has been found in Vhlh-deficient mice (30). Thus, Idh mutation has a cell-autonomous effect on chondrocytes, resulting in a cartilaginous dysplasia of the long bones, ribs, and tracheal cartilage.  Idh1 Mutations and 2HG Regulate Proliferation and Expression of Markers of Hypertrophic Differentiation. Because the fetal limbs showed a persistence of cells expressing type X collagen, we examined how mutant Idh might alter the expression of genes characteristically produced by hypertrophic chondrocytes. Chondrocytes from the mice were grown as primary cell cultures for 4 d. Cells were examined for the expression of Sox9, type 2 collagen, Runx2, and type X collagen or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation over the last 12 h of culture. They were also examined for the expression of the Hh target genes Gli1 and Ptch1, because these genes are known to be expressed in enchondromas (8). There was increased expression of genes expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes, Runx2, and type X collagen (Fig. 3A) in the cells from the mice expressing the mutation. In contrast, there was no difference in expression of Sox9 or type 2 collagen. There was also a mild increase in proliferation as detected by BrdU incorporation in the mutant cultures (Fig. 3D). WT chondrocyte cultures were then treated with 10 μM Octyl-d-2HG or l-2HG, an enantiomer of d-2HG. Treatment with either agent caused the same effect. In both cases, this treatment caused an up-regulation of Runx2 and collagen X expressions to levels similar to those observed in the mutant cultures as well as an increase in BrdU incorporation (Fig. 3 B and D). In addition, there was an increase in expression of Hh target genes in chondrocytes from mice expressing the mutant Idh1 or control chondrocytes treated with 2HG (Fig. 3E). Thus, mutant Idh1 as well as 2HG treatment result in an increase in expression of Hh target genes (genes characteristic of hypertrophic chondrocytes) and an increase in cell proliferation.  Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Idh1-R132Q and 2HG increase the expression of hypertrophic chondrocyte markers and increase cell proliferation. (A) Expression of markers of hypertrophic chondrocytes is significantly higher in chondrocytes from mice expressing Idh1-R132Q. Relative expression ... Conditional Idh Mutant Mice Develop Enchondroma-Like Cartilage Lesions. Because Col2a1-Cre;Idh1-KI mice could not survive after weaning, a tamoxifen-inducible Col2a1-Cre/ERT2 transgenic mouse line was crossed with the Idh1-KI mouse line to examine the effect of mutant Idh1 on the postnatal mouse growth plate. Tamoxifen was injected into mutant and WT littermates at 4 wk of age for 10 doses at 100 mg/kg body weight, and their skeletons were harvested 3 mo after the injection was completed. Histological analysis of their knees showed multiple enchondroma-like cartilage lesions adjacent to the growth plates (Fig. 4A). Between four and eight cartilage lesions were detected in the growth plates of each mutant knee (Fig. 4C). No lesions were observed in the control mice. Immunohistochemistry showed patchy expression of Col10a1 in the cartilage lesions (Fig. 4B), also suggesting dysregulation of chondrocyte differentiation. To determine the longer-term effect of mutant Idh1 on growth-plate cartilage, mutant mice were observed 6 mo after induction of the conditional allele. Multiple cartilage lesions were also found in knees of older Col2a1-Cre/ERT2;Idh1-KI mutant mice, although no obvious difference in size or numbers of such lesions was observed (Fig. S3).  Fig. 4.

Go to: DISCUSSION Here, we show that there is a high variability in the types of IDH mutations present in enchondromas and chondrosarcomas at IDH1 R132 and that these mutations result in the production of d-2HG. Both mutant IDH and treatment with d-2HG increase cell proliferation and the expression of genes associated with hypertrophic chondrocytes. In vivo, this mutation also results in the persistence of type X collagen-producing chondrocytes. Conditional expression of a mutant Idh in chondrocytes inhibits growth-plate chondrocyte differentiation, and driving the mutation postnatally results in an enchondroma-like phenotype, showing that the presence of the Idh mutation alone is sufficient to cause enchondromatosis.  We found a broad range of IDH1 mutations in enchondromas and chondrosarcomas, including the IDH1-R132Q mutation, which has not been previously reported to our knowledge. As has been described for all other IDH1 driver mutations, this mutation resulted in increased production of d-2HG. As such, it seems that any substitution at R132 observed in human tumors samples functions to produce d-2HG. In our cell culture studies, either a mutant Idh or treatment with d-2HG caused the same changes in gene expression and an increase in cell proliferation.  Data from enchondromas in humans and mice overexpressing Gli2 or a mutant PTHR1 in chondrocytes show that these tumors consist of rests of cartilage that persist in the ends of bone. These cells proliferate slowly as the animals mature but then do not enlarge over time after skeletal maturity (8). This phenotype is similar to what we observed in the Idh mutant mice. As such, persistence of hypertrophic chondrocytes likely allows rests of growth-plate cells to remain near the end of the bone, resulting in enchondromas. The mild proliferative advantage that we observed is likely enough to maintain these chondrocytes, preventing their normal replacement by bone, but does not result in a lesion that grows with time.  Previous studies found IDH mutations in a variety of benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumors, including osteosarcomas and giant cell tumors of bone (16, 31, 32). Furthermore, the mouse mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2 expressing the IDH2 R172K mutation can give rise to poorly differentiated sarcomas in xenograft models (17). Although IDH mutations can be found in a number of neoplastic conditions, they may not be causative in all. Because IDH mutations are present in both enchondromas and chondrosarcomas and expression of mutant Idh in mice results in the development of enchondroma-like lesions, not chondrosarcomas, it is likely that the mutation is causative for the benign precursor lesion, and additional mutations are needed for malignant progression. This notion is supported by the overall low frequency of genes harboring mutations in chondrosarcomas (33). This finding is consistent with previous data from mice overexpressing the Gli2 transcription factor, which develop enchondroma-like lesions but when crossed with mice deficient in p53, develop chondrosarcomas (34). Indeed, we found reregulation of Hh target genes with expression of the mutant receptor, and the phenotype that we observed was identical to that seen with overexpression of Gli2 in chondrocytes. The fatal nature of driving the mutation during development supports the concept that a somatic event during growth causes this lesion.  We found that a mutant IDH and 2HG result in a persistence of hypertrophic chondrocytes. This finding is consistent with data from a genetically modified mouse, in which Gli2 transcriptional activation inhibits chondrocyte differentiation, causing enchondromas (8), which show a similar phenotype. 2HG causes persistence of growth-plate chondrocytes, resulting in enchondromas, which then could undergo additional genetic events to become chondrosarcomas. This etiology raises the possibility that therapies to drive terminal differentiation could be used to treat these tumors, for which there are no current universally effective therapies. Because IDH mutants produce d-2HG that inhibits differentiation, IDH-targeted therapy is one such potential approach. Future experiments will evaluate the effects of mutant IDH inhibitors in this model and others of IDH-driven disease.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Sequencing. All human chondrosarcoma samples were coded and handled according to the ethical guidelines of the host institutions. Genomic DNA from frozen tumors was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Capillary Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze the samples for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations after PCR amplification on exon 4 of IDH1 and IDH2. Standard cloning followed by Sanger sequencing was used to confirm sequencing results for the R132Q mutation.  Animals. Idh1-KI (27), Col2a1-Cre (35), and Col2a1-Cre/ERT2 (36) have been described previously. The Idh1-KI mouse used in this study is identical to the animal previously described (27) but bears an R132Q mutation rather than an R132H mutation. A mouse protocol describing the above experimental procedures was approved by the animal care committee of the Hospital for Sick Children. For analysis of perinatal skeletons, mice from E15.5 to postnatal day 1 were examined, and at least three mice of each genotype were analyzed. The tumor phenotypes between at least five littermates of each genotype and age group were compared. Tamoxifen was injected into mutant and WT littermates at 4 wk of age for 10 doses at 100 mg/kg body weight, and their skeletons were harvested 3 mo after the injection was completed.  Chondrocyte Cultures. The chondrocyte isolation protocol was modified from previously published methods. Growth plates of hind limbs from 16.5-d postcoitum embryos were isolated and incubated in collagenase type 4 solution (3 mg/mL; Worthington) for 45 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a Petri dish (37). Cells were cultured for 4 d with or without l-2HG (Toronto Research Chemicals) or octyl-d-2HG ester (Toronto Research Chemicals). BrdU was added for the last 12 h in culture and detected immunohistochemically as previously reported (38).  Histological Analysis. Samples were fixed in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for histological evaluation. Adult mouse bones were treated with Immunocal (Decal) for decalcification before embedding. Safranin O, H&E, von Kossa, and alcian blue staining was performed using standard techniques. Col10 staining was used as a marker for chondrocyte-terminal differentiation by incubating the sections with a 1:50 dilution of anti-human recombinant Col10 (Quartett Immunodiagnostika Biotechnologie GMBH) at 4 °C overnight. For whole-mount alizarin red and alcian blue staining, embryos were stained after they were fixed in 100% ethanol and transferred to acetone as described previously (39).  Real-Time Quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted and purified using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified RNA was reverse-transcribed with QuantiTect Reverse Transcription (Qiagen). cDNAs were subjected to quantitative PCR using SYBR green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences are available on request.  IDH1 Enzymology. WT and mutant IDH1 vectors were created in the pET30A plasmid by standard PCR-directed mutagenesis; 6× His-tagged recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia coli and purified using a standard nickel column. The spectrophotometric assay for NADPH consumption was performed under the following conditions: 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM α-KG, and 0.05 mM NADPH. The reaction was initiated by adding recombinant protein at the indicated concentration. Spectrophotometric measurement of NADPH was made directly at 340 nm over time; for determination of kinetic parameters with regard to α-KG, NADPH concentration was held constant, and α-KG was varied from 0.1 to 10 mM. For in-cell assays, HEK293T cells (ATCC) were transfected with pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vectors as indicated and allowed to grow for 24 h. Transfected cells were collected to assess protein expression by Western blot and plated to 96-well plates to measure cellular d-2HG production. After another 48 h, media were collected to measure d-2HG production by the transfected cells.  Metabolite Determinations. For d-2HG measurement, metabolites were extracted using 80% aqueous methanol as previously described (17). Briefly, 10–15 mg limb cartilage at E16.5 or 200 μL culture medium was immersed in 80% methanol at −80 °C and homogenized. Extracts were subjected to ion-paired, reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to negative-mode electrospray triple-quadrupole MS using multiple reaction monitoring. Integrated elution peaks were compared with metabolite standard curves for absolute quantification.  IDH1 and IDH2 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 and 2) mutants are common in several cancers, including leukemias, and overproduce the (R)-enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2-HG]. Elucidating the role of IDH mutations and (R)-2-HG in leukemogenesis has been hampered by a lack of appropriate cell-based models. Here we show that a canonical IDH1 mutant, IDH1 R132H, promotes cytokine-independence and blocks differentiation in hematopoietic cells. These effects can be recapitulated by (R)-2-HG, but not (S)-2-HG, despite the fact that (S)-2-HG more potently inhibits enzymes previously linked to the pathogenesis of IDH mutant tumors, such as TET2 (Ten Eleven Translocation 2). We provide evidence that this paradox relates to the ability of (S)-2-HG, but not (R)-2-HG, to inhibit the EglN (Egg-laying Defective Nine) prolyl hydroxylases and, importantly, show that transformation by (R)-2-HG is reversible.  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by somatic genetic mutations that deregulate hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation. In many cases of AML the responsible genetic abnormalities are chromosomal translocations involving key transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and mediators of cell signaling. However, no translocations are detected in 40% of cases of AML (1). In such cases of ‘normal cytogenetic’ AML (NC-AML) the pathogenic driver mutations are largely unknown.  Recent genomic sequencing efforts, however, have identified a number of recurrent mutations in NC-AML that might contribute to leukemogenesis, including mutations in Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) (2). IDH1 and IDH2 are key metabolic enzymes that convert isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate [also called 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)], which is an essential cofactor for 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases. These enzymes are linked to diverse cellular processes such as adaptation to hypoxia, histone demethylation and DNA modification (3). Cancer-associated IDH mutants convert 2-OG to the (R)-enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2-HG] (4, 5). Both the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of 2-HG are structurally similar to 2-OG and can inhibit many 2-OG-dependent enzymes in vitro and in vivo (6-8). In the case of the EglN (Egg-laying defective Nine) prolyl hydroxlases that downregulate the HIF (Hypoxia-inducible Factor) transcription factor, however, (R)-2-HG potentiates, while (S)-2-HG inhibits, EglN activity (8). Mutant IDH is therefore widely believed to transform cells by modulating the behavior of specific 2-OG-dependent enzymes. Nonetheless, IDH mutations induce a number of metabolic abnormalities in addition to (R)-2-HG accumulation (9), and it has not yet been formally proven that (R)-2-HG is sufficient to transform cells. Deciphering the pathogenic roles of mutant IDH and (R)-2-HG in leukemia has been particularly problematic due to the lack of IDH mutant leukemic cell lines and the lack of robust cell-based assays with which to monitor hematopoietic transformation by mutant IDH and (R)-2-HG.  To address this latter deficiency, we stably infected the TF-1 human erythroleukemia cell line with lentiviral vectors encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged versions of wild-type IDH1, a tumor-derived mutant (IDH1 R132H), or an IDH1 R132H variant in which three conserved aspartic acid residues within the IDH1 catalytic domain were replaced with asparagines (R132H/3DN) (Fig. 1A). This leukemic line is unusual insofar as it is cytokine-dependent (GM-CSF) and retains the ability to differentiate in response to erythropoietin (EPO) (10).  Fig. 1 Fig. 1 IDH1 R132H leukemic transformation assays. (A and B) Immunoblot (A) and LC-MS (B) analysis of TF-1 cells infected with lentiviruses encoding GFP alone (empty) or GFP and the indicated IDH1 variants. Shown are mean LC-MS values of triplicate experiments. ... As expected, 2-HG levels were dramatically increased in cells producing IDH1 R132H but not in cells producing wild-type IDH1 or the catalytically inactive R132H/3DN variant (Fig. 1B). In multiple independent experiments, TF-1 cells expressing IDH1 R132H became cytokine-independent 12-16 days (4 passages) after infection (Fig. 1C). In contrast, parental TF-1 cells spontaneously became cytokine-dependent, but with a much longer and more variable latency. Furthermore, after 10 passages in culture, IDH1 R132H-expressing TF-1 cells, in contrast to the control cells, no longer differentiated in response to EPO (Fig. 1D-1E and fig. S1). Thus expression of mutant IDH in TF-1 cells promotes two hallmarks of leukemic transformation – growth factor-independence and impaired differentiation. Of note, IDH1 R132H impaired the fitness of TF-1 cells grown in the presence of GM-CSF despite conferring a proliferative advantage to TF-1 cells in the absence of GM-CSF (Fig. 1C and fig. S2). Consistent with this observation, IDH1 R132H expression was attenuated in TF-1 cells after repeated passaging in the presence of GM-CSF (fig. S3).  To confirm that the inhibitory effect of mutant IDH on hematopoietic differentiation is not restricted to TF-1 cells, we stably infected SCF (Stem Cell Factor) ER (Estrogen Receptor)-Hoxb8 cells, which are granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells derived from primary murine bone marrow cells immortalized with a conditional oncogene (11), with viruses encoding wild-type IDH1 and IDH1 R132H (fig. S4). In the presence of estrogen these cells express a functional ER-Hoxb8 fusion protein that promotes their survival and proliferation. Upon estrogen withdrawal, the cells differentiate and upregulate expression of the monocytic markers CD11b/Mac1 and Gr1. Expression of IDH1 R132H in SCF ER-Hoxb8 cells, however, blunted their differentiation in response to estrogen withdrawal (Fig. 1F).  To ask whether the effects of IDH1 R132H on TF-1 cells are mediated by (R)-2-HG, we treated TF-1 cells with vehicle (DMSO) or cell membrane-permeable [TFMB (trifluoromethyl benzyl)-esterified] versions of either (R)-2-HG or (S)-2-HG. Measurement of intracellular 2-HG levels in treated TF-1 cells confirmed that the esterified 2-HG enantiomers were equally cell-permeable (Fig. 2A). TF-1 cells passaged in the presence of TFMB-(R)-2-HG became growth factor-independent and no longer differentiated in response to EPO (Fig. 2B and 2E). Promotion of growth factor-independence and loss of EPO-responsiveness by TFMB-(R)-2-HG was dose-dependent (Fig. 2B and fig. S5) and passage-dependent (Fig. 2C and fig. S5). In stark contrast, TFMB-(S)-2-HG did not promote cytokine-independence or block differentiation at any concentration or time point tested (Fig. 2D and 2E). Likewise, treatment of SCF ER-Hoxb8 cells with TFMB-(R)-2-HG, but not TFMB-(S)-2-HG, impaired their differentiation in response to estrogen withdrawal, as determined by decreased expression of Gr1 and persistent expression of the stem cell markers CD34 and c-kit (Fig. 2F-2G, and fig. S6). Thus, (R)-2-HG, but not (S)-2-HG, promotes leukemic transformation. Of note, absolute quantification of (R)-2-HG levels in TF-1 cells transformed by expression of IDH1 R132H or by treatment with TFMB-(R)-2-HG confirmed that the intracellular 2-HG concentrations achieved in both settings approximate those found in IDH mutant neoplasms in patients (low mM) (fig. S7) (12, 13). The accumulation of 2-HG to these high levels in cells treated with 250-500 μM TFMB-(R)-2-HG suggests that the free 2-HG liberated from the ester by intracellular esterases disappears more slowly than TFMB-(R)-2-HG enters the cells.  Fig. 2 Fig. 2 (R)-2-HG is sufficient to promote leukemogenesis. (A) LC-MS analysis of TF-1 cells after treatment for 3 hours with DMSO (-) or 250 μM of the indicated esterified (TFMB) 2-HG. Shown are mean values of triplicate experiments. (B-D) Proliferation ... To begin to understand how (R)-2-HG promotes leukemic transformation we next infected parental TF-1 cells with a pool of lentiviral shRNA vectors targeting all the known 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases (4-8 shRNAs/enzyme) (Table S1), cultured the cells in the absence of GM-CSF, and monitored the abundance of the individual shRNA vectors by next-generation DNA sequencing. We reasoned that the enzymes targeted by shRNAs that were significantly enriched over time (because, for example, those shRNAs confer cytokine-independence) would, if also inhibited by (R)-2-HG at concentrations observed in leukemic cells, contribute to transformation by (R)-2-HG. One of the top scoring enzymes from this screen was TET2 (Ten Eleven Translocation 2), which is mutationally inactivated in a subset of AML and has recently been suggested to be pathogenic target of mutant IDH (Fig. 3A) (14, 15). In contrast, the TET2 paralog TET1 did not score in our screen (Fig. 3A).  Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Opposing roles of TET2 and EglN1 in TF-1 cell transformation. (A) Relative enrichment/depletion of shRNAs targeting TET2 or TET1 in TF-1 cells infected with a pool of ~800 lentiviral shRNAs vectors targeting 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases (4-8 shRNAs/gene) ... We confirmed that TET2 knockdown, but not TET1 knockdown, recapitulated the ability of IDH1 R132H and (R)-2-HG to promote cytokine-independence and block differentiation of TF-1 cells, suggesting that TET2 inhibition contributes to transformation by mutant IDH (Fig. 3B-3C and fig. S8). This, however, created a paradox, because (S)-2-HG is a more potent inhibitor of TET2 than is (R)-2-HG (6, 8), and yet TFMB-(R)-2-HG, but not TFMB-(S)-2-HG, promoted TF-1 cell transformation (Fig. 2). Moreover, TFMB-(S)-2-HG, but not TFMB-(R)-2-HG, antagonized transformation induced by TET2 knockdown (Fig. 3D). We reasoned that this conundrum might relate to the fact that (R)-2-HG and (S)-2-HG have opposing effects on EglN activity, with (S)-2-HG serving as an inhibitor and (R)-2-HG, at least in some cellular contexts, serving as an agonist (8). Moreover, we found that TF-1 cells expressing IDH1 R132H were relatively resistant to upregulation of HIF1α by the 2-OG competitive antagonist dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), suggesting that (R)-2-HG acts as an EglN agonist in these cells as well (Fig. 3E). We therefore considered the possibility that inhibition of EglN1 by (S)-2-HG prevents it from transforming TF-1 cells. Indeed, we found that knockdown of EglN1 with multiple independent shRNAs abrogated the growth factor-independence, and restored the differentiation, of TF-1 cells transformed by expression of IDH1 R132H or by knockdown of TET2 (Fig. 3F-3G and fig. S9-S10).  To ask whether the oncogenic effects of (R)-2-HG are reversible, we first confirmed that a minimum of 4 passages in TFMB-(R)-2-HG were required to render TF-1 cells cytokine-independent, provided TFMB-(R)-2-HG exposure was maintained during the cytokine withdrawal period (Fig. 4A). Next, late passage TFMB-(R)-2-HG-treated TF-1 cells were passaged out of TFMB-(R)-2-HG for variable periods prior to removal of GM-CSF (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the amount of time required for reversion of growth factor independence was influenced by the intensity (duration × dose) of TFMB-(R)-2-HG exposure (Fig. 4A-4B). In stark contrast, removal of TFMB-(R)-2-HG rapidly restored the ability of TF-1 cells to differentiate in response to EPO even after long-term passage in the presence of TFMB-(R)-2-HG (Fig. 4C). Of note, late-passage TF-1 cells that expressed lower levels of mutant IDH1 (fig. S3B) and produced lower levels of (R)-2-HG (fig. S7) spontaneously regained the ability to differentiate in response to EPO but remained growth factor-independent (fig. S11).  Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Transformation by (R)-2-HG is reversible. (A) Proliferation of TF-1 cells under cytokine-poor conditions after being passaged 4 times in the presence of DMSO or 250 μM TFMB-(R)-2-HG. At the time of GM-CSF withdrawal TFMB-(R)-2-HG was either maintained ... In a complementary set of experiments, we found that a tool compound (AGX-891) that specifically blocks 2-HG production by IDH1 R132H (fig. S12) (16) restored the ability of IDH1 R132H-expressing TF-1 cells (Fig. 4D) and SCF ER-Hoxb8 cells (Fig. 4F) to differentiate in vitro and abrogated the growth factor independence of IDH1 R132H-expressing TF-1 cells (Fig. 4G and fig. S13). These effects were on-target because they were not observed in cells transformed with TFMB-(R)-2-HG rather than IDH1 R132H (Fig. 4E and 4H).  Tumor-associated IDH mutations cause many metabolic abnormalities in addition to the accumulation of (R)-2-HG (9). Our studies indicate, however, that (R)-2-HG is sufficient to confer the two hallmarks of leukemia, enhanced proliferation and impaired differentiation. (R)-2-HG can inhibit many 2-OG-dependent enzymes, including various histone demethylases and the 5′-methylcytosine hydroxylase TET2 (6-8). We found that downregulation of TET2, like (R)-2-HG, promotes cytokine-independence and blocks differentiation. This is consistent with the model that leukemic transformation by mutant IDH is linked to inhibition of TET2 by (R)-2-HG, thus accounting for the observation that IDH and TET2 mutations both occur in acute leukemia but are mutually exclusive (15).  At intermediate (R)-2-HG concentrations TF-1 cells remain cytokine-independent but can once again differentiate. This observation, together with the behavior of TF-1 cells treated with different doses of (R)-2-HG and their responses to (R)-2-HG withdrawal, strongly suggest that higher levels of (R)-2-HG are needed to block differentiation than to confer cytokine-independence. This suggests that the differentiation phenotype requires more profound TET2 inhibition than the growth phenotype. Interestingly, targeted expression of IDH1 R132H in the murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment causes gradual expansion of long-term HSCs without any evidence of impaired myeloid differentiation (17). In contrast, mice lacking TET2 exhibit both expansion of their HSC compartment and aberrant myeloid differentiation (18).  Although TET2 appears to be an important target of (R)-2-HG in our system we have not yet formally proven that TET2 inhibition is necessary, in addition to being sufficient, for transformation by mutant IDH. Inhibition of other 2OG-dependent enzymes by (R)-2-HG may enhance or suppress leukemic transformation by mutant IDH. With respect to the latter, the observation that the levels of mutant IDH and (R)-2-HG fell over time in TF-1 cells grown under growth factor-rich conditions suggests that high levels of (R)-2-HG may be deleterious in certain cellular contexts, perhaps due to inhibition of other 2-OG-dependent enzymes that promote cell growth and survival. These considerations might be relevant to the clinical differences between IDH mutant and TET2 mutant myeloid disorders (19).  Leukemic transformation by 2-HG is specific to the (R) enantiomer produced by mutant IDH and not the (S) enantiomer, even though (S)-2-HG is a more potent inhibitor of all of the 2-OG-dependent enzymes tested to date, including TET2 (6-8). This conundrum appears to be explained by the differential effects of the two enantiomers on EglN1, with (R)-2-HG serving as an agonist and (S)-2-HG as an antagonist (8), and by our observation that loss of EglN1 activity blocks transformation by mutant IDH or loss of TET2. Several studies have suggested that the canonical EglN1 target, HIF, can inhibit hematopoietic stem cell and leukemic cell proliferation (20-26). Interestingly, people living at high altitude, and hence presumed to have lower basal EglN1 activity due to chronic hypoxia, appear to have a lower risk of leukemia (27, 28).  The hypothesis that mutant IDH transforms cells by affecting epigenetic marks has raised fears that these changes will not be reversible in a therapeutically relevant timescale. Our studies suggest that the effects of (R)-2-HG are reversible, offering hope that compounds that block (R)-2-HG production by IDH mutants will benefit patients. Moreover, the relatively rapid reversion of the (R)-2-HG transformation phenotypes suggests that the relevant epigenetic marks are more dynamic than previously suspected or that these phenotypes reflect non-canonical functions of enzymes such as TET2. In addition, our findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of EglN1 might also be useful for the treatment of leukemias that harbor IDH or TET2 mutations.   Mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenases are frequently found in human glioblastomas1 and cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukaemias (AML)2. These alterations are gain-of-function mutations in that they drive the synthesis of the ‘oncometabolite’ R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG)3. It remains unclear how IDH1 and IDH2 mutations modify myeloid cell development and promote leukaemogenesis. Here we report the characterization of conditional knock-in (KI) mice in which the most common IDH1 mutation, IDH1(R132H), is inserted into the endogenous murine Idh1 locus and is expressed in all haematopoietic cells (Vav-KI mice) or specifically in cells of the myeloid lineage (LysM-KI mice). These mutants show increased numbers of early haematopoietic progenitors and develop splenomegaly and anaemia with extramedullary haematopoiesis, suggesting a dysfunctional bone marrow niche. Furthermore, LysM-KI cells have hypermethylated histones and changes to DNA methylation similar to those observed in human IDH1- or IDH2-mutant AML. To our knowledge, our study is the first to describe the generation and characterization of conditional IDH1(R132H)-KI mice, and also the first report to demonstrate the induction of a leukaemic DNA methylation signature in a mouse model. Our report thus sheds light on the mechanistic links between IDH1 mutation and human AML.  IDH1/IDH2 mutations typically produce mutant enzymes with aberrant activity. Whereas wild-type (WT) Idh proteins metabolize isocitrate and NADP+ to yield α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and NADPH, mutant Idh proteins convert αKG into 2HG while consuming NADPH3.2HG competitively inhibits tet methylcytosine dioxygenases (Tet2), which regulate DNA methylation, as well as JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases4–6. Accordingly, human AML cells with IDH1/IDH2 mutation show global DNA hypermethylation5.  To create a murine model of the IDH1(R132H) mutation, we used the lox-stop-lox (LSL) system to generate a conditional Idh1 knock-in (KI) mouse (Idh1LSL/WT) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Mutant mice were crossed with LysMCre mice7 (Idh1LSL/WTLysMCre+/WT, LsyM-KI), because the LysM promoter is activated very early during myeloid development8 and human AML leukaemic stem cells show similarities with very early myeloid primed progenitors (LMPP)9.  LysM-KI mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio, were viable and fertile, and had normal lifespans. However, serum 2HG levels were elevated approximately tenfold in both young (7–16 weeks old) and older (47–56 weeks old) LysM-KI mice (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). Whereas peripheral blood cell counts of young LysM-KI mice were normal, older (42–46 weeks old) mutants developed anaemia (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e). In the OP9/OP9-DL1 in vitro differentiation system10, haematopoietic cell lineages developed normally from several IDH1(R132H)-KI embryonic stem cell clones (Supplementary Fig. 4). Macroscopic analysis of mice revealed mild splenic enlargement in young LysM-KI mice that progressed to overt splenomegaly in all older mutants. Histologically, splenic architecture became increasingly disorganized, with age-dependent expansion of spaces between lymphoid follicles and obvious extramedullary haematopoiesis (Fig. 1a, b).  Figure 1 Figure 1 LysM-KI mice show age-dependent splenomegaly and decreased bone marrow cellularity We next evaluated the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and haematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) compartments in LysM-KI mice. Bone marrow (BM) cellularity was normal in young LysM-KI mice but reduced in older mutants (Fig. 1c), where it correlated inversely with splenomegaly and the degree of anaemia. Histologically, the BM of young mutants appeared normal but the BM of older mutants showed fewer mature cells and more immature cells (Fig. 1d). Flow cytometric analyses of BM and spleen revealed altered numbers of mature cells (CD11b+, Gr1+, B220+, CD4+, CD8+) in LysM-KI mice (Fig. 1e, f).  More refined flow cytometric analyses confirmed that lineage-negative (Lin−) cells underwent an age-dependent expansion in LysM-KI BM (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, LSK (Lin−Sca1+cKit+) cells were increased by approximately 1.8-fold in young LysM-KI mice and by approximately 5.4-fold in older mutants (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Table 1). The LSK population contains long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs; CD150+CD48−), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs; CD150+CD48+), and lineage-restricted progenitors (LRPs; CD150−CD48+). We found that LysM-KI mice demonstrated an age-dependent increase in LRPs (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 1). There were no significant alterations to the LK population (Lin−Sca1−cKit+), which contains common myeloid progenitors (CMPs;CD34+CD16/32medLK), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs; CD34+CD16/32highLK), and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs; CD34−CD16/32lowLK), or to the common lymphoid progenitor population (CLPs; Lin−Il7Ra+Sca1medcKitmed) (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 1). In colony-forming cell (CFC) assays, BM cells from young or older LysM-KI mice showed statistically normal production of granulocyte (G), granulocyte-macrophage (GM), granulocyte-erythrocyte-macrophage-megakaryocyte (GEMM), and macrophage (M) colonies (Fig. 2c). Flow cytometric analysis of nucleated splenic cells from older LysM-KI mice revealed significantly elevated numbers of LSK and LRP cells, recapitulating the pattern observed in the bone marrow of these mice (Fig. 2a, d). CFC assays of nucleated splenic cells showed increased numbers of all four myeloid colony types in LysM-KI mice (Fig. 2e). These data confirm that extra-medullary haematopoiesis occurs in older LysM-KI mice.  Figure 2 Figure 2 LysM-KI mice showage-dependent increases in lineage-restricted progenitors and extramedullary haematopoiesis We speculated that the LRP accumulation in LysM-KI BM (and spleen), despite the near-normal peripheral blood counts of these animals and their normal BM cell CFC activity, might be due to increased symmetric cell division and proliferation, and/or a partial block in differentiation. Serial plating experiments showed that, whereas control BM cells stopped proliferating after three rounds of plating (24 days), LysM-KI BM cells continued to grow at an exponential rate for six rounds of plating (45 days) (Fig. 2f).  To extend our findings, we crossed Idh1LSL/WT mice with VavCre mice11 to generate Vav-KI mutants expressing IDH1(R132H) in all haematopoietic cells, from LT-HSCs to terminally differentiated cells. Lin-negative, LSK, LRP and CLP cells were all significantly increased in BM of young Vav-KI mice (Supplementary Fig. 5a), as were splenic LSK, LK, LRP, MEP and CLP cells (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Like young LysM-KI mice, young Vav-KI mice had normal total BM cell numbers and showed no overt haematological changes (Supplementary Fig. 5c–e).  Next, we performed competitive BM repopulation assays in which equal numbers (105) of nucleated BM cells from donor mice (control or LysM-KI; CD45.2+) and from recipient mice (control; CD45.1+) were injected into lethally-irradiated recipients (CD45.1+). LysM-KI BM cells showed no defects in short-term or long-term repopulation capacity for at least 170 days after transplantation, and relative peripheral blood cell counts were not altered in recipients of LysM-KI BM (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b).  The homeostasis of HSCs and HPCs is influenced by reactive oxygen species (ROS)12,13. Because high ROS reduces HSC longevity, these cells strive to keep ROS low13. In contrast, higher levels of ROS in developing myeloid cells may be necessary for their differentiation13.ROS elevation in AML cells triggers their differentiation14. It has been assumed that IDH1/IDH2 mutations increase ROS3. However, when using CM-H2DCFDA (5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester; a membrane-permeable indicator of reactive oxygen species) to measure total ROS in granulocytes (CD11b+Gr1+), macrophages/monocytes (CD11b+Gr1low), LSK and LK cells in BM of young and older LysM-KI mice, no abnormalities were observed (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of 2HG as well as of NAD+, NADH, NADP+ and NADPH in CD11b+ cells isolated from BM and spleen of control and LysM-KI mice, and in BM-derived macrophages (BMDMs) revealed highly elevated 2HG in all LysM-KI samples, whereas NAD+, NADH, NADP+ and NADPH levels were not altered (Supplementary Fig. 7c–e). Taken together, these data indicate that the phenotype of LysM-KI mice is not due to alterations in ROS or NADPH levels, nor to 2HG-mediated complete abolition of myeloid differentiation.  The hypoxia-inducible transcription factors Hif1α and Hif2α are critical for HSC survival and maintenance15 but their involvement in HPC differentiation and beyond is unclear. IDH1 mutations have been shown to alter Hif1α stability6,16. We compared messenger RNA levels of several Hif1α target genes in sorted control and LysM-KI LSK cells but observed no differences (Supplementary Fig. 8). Thus, it is unlikely that Hif1α signalling is altered in LysM-KI LSK cells.  To analyse global mRNA expression, we performed gene expression microarray analyses of sorted LSK cells from young LysM-KI and control mice. Two-way hierarchical clustering of significantly altered genes (P value < 0.05, >1.5-fold change) revealed a clear separation of control and LysM-KI samples (Supplementary Fig. 9). Gene ontology analysis of the identified gene signature (Supplementary Table 3) revealed a significant enrichment of genes in several categories related to cellular growth and proliferation (Supplementary Table 4).  Human gliomas17 and AMLs with IDH1/IDH2 mutations have DNA hypermethylation that, in AML, is caused by 2HG-mediated inhibition of Tet2 (ref. 5). 2HG also inhibits histone demethylases, resulting in hypermethylation of histone lysine residues (especially in H3)4,6.To examine DNA methylation, we performed high-throughput sequencing of bisulphite-treated DNA from sorted LSK cells from young LysM-KI and control mice. DNA from LysM-KI LSK cells showed a significantly greater proportion of highly methylated CpG sites, with a marked increase in CpG sites showing greater than 80% methylation (Fig. 3a). A more detailed analysis of the differential distribution pattern of DNA methylation revealed wide-spread global changes, with all chromosomes equally affected (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b and Supplementary Table 5). A clear preference for promoters and intragenic regions was observed that paralleled the changes in DNA methylation observed in human IDH1/IDH2-mutant AMLs (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 10a, b and Supplementary Table 5)18. Comparison of the 1,559 hypermethylated murine genes in LysM-KI LSK cells to the 8195 hypermethylated human genes in IDH1/IDH2-mutant AMLs revealed an overlap of 784 genes (P = 1.63 × 10−36; Supplementary Table 6). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) implicated several signalling pathways involved in haematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation, leukaemogenesis and leukaemic stem cell maintenance (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Fig. 11)19–22 including the WNT, NOTCH and TGF-β pathways, which are also targeted by aberrant methylation in human IDH1/IDH2-mutant AMLs18. Immunoblotting of lysates from control and LysM-KI BMDMs revealed increased methylation of multiple H3 lysine residues (Fig. 3c).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Altered methylation of DNA and histones in LysM-KI cells In conclusion, we show that the IDH1(R132H) mutation in all haematopoietic cells (Vav-KI), and in the myeloid lineage in particular (LysM-KI), results in the accumulation of LSK and LRP cells first in the bone marrow and later in the spleen. We believe that the accumulations of these cells are most likely due to 2HG-induced DNA and histone hypermethylation that affect LSK cell division and/or differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 1). Our finding that IDH1(R132H) does not completely block myeloid differentiation may explain why IDH1/IDH2 mutations are found in almost all FAB (French-American-British classification) AML subtypes23. Moreover, our mutants show extramedullary haematopoiesis, suggesting a dysfunctional bone marrow niche. Extramedullary haematopoiesis occurs in myelodysplastic syndromes, which frequently progress to AML and harbour IDH1/IDH2 mutations in 10–15% of cases24. Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to model epigenetic changes of human IDH1/IDH2-mutant AML in mice and thereby advances and will advance our understanding of the links between IDH1/IDH2 mutations and leukaemogenesis.  Go to: METHODS Generation of LSL-Idh1R132H mice and breeding  The targeting vector containing both the loxP-flanked STOP (LSL) cassette and the IDH1(R132H) mutation is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. The LSL cassette (Addgene) is composed of the puromycin resistance gene, a splicing acceptor sequence that stops transcription at the insertion point, and four repeats of the SV40 polyA sequence. Thus, the presence of LSL inhibits expression of the IDH1(R132H) protein, and Idh1LSL/WT mice are therefore heterozygous for the Idh1 wild-type allele. Cre-mediated excision of LSL allows expression of the IDH1(R132H) protein (Idh1LSL/WT Cre+).  The targeting vector was assembled by cloning the LSL cassette plus PCR-generated genomic fragments of the Idh1 gene representing short, middle and long arms of homology into the DT-A vector where the middle fragment contains murine Idh1 exon 4 bearing the R132H mutation, which was created by PCR-based mutagenesis. The linearized targeting vector was electroporated into E14K or Bruce4 embryonic stem cells. Homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern blotting using 5′-flanking, 3′-flanking, and puromycin-specific probes. Chimaeric mice were produced by microinjection of targeted embryonic stem cells into E3.5 blastocysts. Chimaeras derived from E14K or Bruce4 embryonic stem cells were bred to C57BL/6J or B6-Tyrc-2J/J mice, respectively. Germline transmission of the mutant Idh1 allele was confirmed by genomic Southern blotting. Both E14K-derived and Bruce4-derived strains were crossed to C57Bl/6J, and F2–F5 generations were used for analysis. The phenotypes of the resulting progeny were identical. For transplantation studies only offspring derived from the Bruce4-derived chimaeras was used. Pups were genotyped by PCR analysis using specific primer pairs to detect the wild-type and mutant Idh1 alleles. Sense and antisense primers for the KI, wild-type and LSL alleles were 5′-ACCAGCACCTCCCAACTTGTAT-3′, 5′-AGGTTAGCTCTTGCCGATCCGT-3′, and 5′-CAGCA GCCTCTGTTCCACATAC-3′, which yielded PCR products of the predicted sizes of 394 base pairs (bp), 307 bp, and 223 bp, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2c). All animals were treated in accordance with the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as approved by the Ontario Cancer Institute Animal Care Committee (Toronto, Ontario, Canada).  LysMCre mice (B6.129P2-Lyz2tm1(cre)Ifo/J; catalogue no. 004781), VavCre mice (B6.Cg-Tg(Vav1-cre)A2Kio/J; catalogue no. 008610) and CD45.1 mice (B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ; catalogue no. 002014) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. LysMCre mice and VavCre mice were backcrossed into the C57Bl/6J background for at least 10 generations. LysM-KI mice were generated by breeding Idh1LSL/WT mice with LysMCre+/WT mice as well as by crossing LysM-KI mice with wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Vav-KI mice were generated by breeding Idh1LSL/WT mice with VavCre+/WT mice as well as by crossing Vav-KI mice with wild-type C57BL/6 mice.  For all experiments, LysM-KI mice were heterozygous for both the IdhLSL allele and the LysMCre allele (Idh1LSL/WTLysMCre+/WT), and Vav-KI mice were heterozygous for both the IdhLSL allele and the VavCre allele (Idh1LSL/WTVavCre+/WT). Control mice were wild-type animals or animals heterozygous for either the Idh1LSL allele or the LysMCre allele, if LysM-KI mice were used, or the VavCre allele, if Vav-KI mice were used (Idh1WT/WTLysMCreWT/WT, Idh1WT/WTLysMCre+/WT, Idh1LSL/WTVavCreWT/WT, or Idh1WT/WTVavCre+/WT). All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University Health Network (Toronto, Ontario, Canada).  Generation of IDH1(R132H)-KI embryonic stem cell clones  KI embryonic stem cells which had been generated while making the KI mouse were expanded and transiently transfected with pCAGGS-nlsCre using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated on gelatin-coated cell culture plates. Single colonies were picked and plated in duplicates into 96-well plates to test for puromycin sensitivity as the Cre-mediated recombination of the LSL cassette results in loss of the puromycin-resistance cassette. Puromycin-sensitive clones were expanded, tested by PCR-genotyping, and then used for in vitro differentiation experiments.  OP9/OP9-DL1 embryonic stem cell in vitro differentiation system  Experiments including co-culture and differentiation of embryonic stem cells in the presence of OP9 or OP9-DL1 cells were carried out as described elsewhere9.  Histology  For histological analyses, mouse tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin. After fixation, femurs were decalcified in formic acid. Fixed tissues were paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin according to standard laboratory protocols.  Flow cytometric analyses  Flow cytometric analyses were performed according to standard protocols. In brief, mice were euthanized, single-cell suspensions from bone marrow (BM) were generated by flushing out the bone marrow from tibia and femur in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS) (IMDM2). Single-cell suspensions of spleens were generated by mashing the spleen in IMDM2. Cell suspensions were passed through 70 µm cell strainers, centrifuged and resuspended in ammonium-based red cell lysis buffer (Sigma). Nucleated cells were washed in IMDM2, centrifuged and resuspended in flow cytometric buffer (PBS without Mg2+ or Ca2+ (PBS−/−), 2% HI-FBS, 5mMEDTA, pH8.0). Viable cell numbers were determined by cell counting after trypan blue staining.  For flow cytometric analyses, cells were incubated in Fc block (BD Biosciences) and then immunostained with fluorophore-linked antibodies (BD Biosciences, eBioscience). For immunostaining of lineage-positive cells, a cocktail containing biotin-labelled primary antibodies against CD5, B220, CD11b, 7-4, Gr-1 and Ter-119 (Miltenyi Biotec) was used, followed by staining with streptavidin-linked fluorophore-labelled secondary antibodies.  To detect total reactive oxygen species (ROS), immunostained cells were incubated with the live cell dye CM-H2DCFDA (100 µM) at 37 °C for 15 min followed by two washes in flow cytometric buffer. flow cytometric data were acquired on a BD CantoII and analysed using FlowJo (TreeStar). For flow cytometric analyses of differentiated cells, 104–105 events were acquired. For HSC and HPC analyses, up to 2.5 × 106 events were acquired. Statistical analyses of flow cytometric data were performed using the GraphPad Prism software.  LSK cell sorting  Single-cell suspensions from BM were generated as described above from young mice (8 to 12 weeks of age) and cells were resuspended in flow cytometric buffer and counted. Lineage-negative cells were isolated using the Miltenyi lineage cell depletion kit. Cells were counted and immunostained as described above with anti-lineage-biotin/streptavidin-APC-Cy7, anti-cKit-PE-Cy7 and anti-Sca-1-APC antibodies. Cells were then sorted on a BD FACSAria cell sorter, collected in IMDM2, centrifuged and pellets shock-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until further processing.  Real-time RT–PCR analysis  RNA was purified from sorted LSK cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen), resuspended in water and quantified on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer before transcription into cDNA using the iScript complementary DNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Primers used for RT–PCR are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Real-time RT–PCR analyses were performed using Power SybrGreen on a 7900HT Fast-Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Ct values were normalized to the housekeeping gene Hprt (ΔCt) and then to the average of the Δ Ct values of all samples (ΔΔCt). Relative mRNA expression levels were calculated (2−ΔΔCt) and normalized to the average of the relative control mRNA expression levels.  Colony-forming cell (CFC) assays  Single-cell suspensions from BM or spleen from control and LysM-KI mice were generated as described above. Cells were then plated at a density of 104 ml−1 for BM and 105 ml−1 for spleen in triplicates in complete methylcellulose media containing stem cell factor, Il-3, Il-6 and erythropoietin (Stem Cell Technologies, M3434). Colonies were counted after 7 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For serial plating cells were collected from methylcellulose media, washed once in IMDM2, counted and replated in complete methylcellulose media at a density of 104 ml−1.  Bone marrow competitive repopulation experiments  For competitive BM transfer, donor BM cells from control or LysM-KI mice (CD45.2+), and competitor BM cells from WT mice (CD45.1+), were isolated as described above and then washed in PBS−/− twice. Cell numbers were adjusted to 106 ml−1. Lethally-irradiated (10.5 Gy) recipient mice (CD45.1+) were injected with 105 donor BM cells plus 105 competitor BM cells (2 × 105 total). For flow cytometric analyses of peripheral blood, mice were bled from the tail vein and immunostaining was carried out as described above. Immunostained blood samples were fixed in FoxP3 fixation buffer (eBioscience) to lyse red blood cells, washed in flow cytometric buffer, and analysed by flow cytometry.  Generation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)  BMDMs were generated from single-cell BM suspensions of young control or LysM-KI mice using a standard in vitro M-CSF-based differentiation protocol. In brief, 5 × 106 cells were plated on a 10-cm tissue culture plate in 5 ml of RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% HI-FBS and 50 ng ml−1 M-CSF. On days 2, 3, and 4 an additional 1 ml of the complete media was added to every tissue culture plate. Cells were collected on day 5 of the in vitro differentiation procedure and washed in PBS containing Mg2+ and Ca2+ (PBS+/+) before being used in experiments.  Immunoblot analysis  For immunoblot analysis of histone-3 methylation, equal numbers of BMDMs were generated as described above and lysed in 1 × cell lysis buffer (20mMTris-HCl pH7.5, 150mMNaCl, 1mMEDTApH8.0, 1mMEGTA pH8.0, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). SDS (1%) was added to lysates and incubation was continued for another 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged, loading buffer was added to supernatants, and samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% Bis-Tris gels using MES running buffer (Invitrogen). Separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Proteins were then detected using standard laboratory procedures. Primary antibodies used in this study recognized total histone-3 (Abcam ab10799), histone-3 K4me3 (Millipore 07-473), histone-3 K9me3 (Abcam ab8898), histone-3 K27me3 (Millipore 07-449), histone-3 K36me3 (Abcam ab9050), or histone-3 K79me2 (Cell Signaling Technology 9757).  Mass spectrometry  CD11b+ cells were isolated from single-cell suspensions of BM or spleen cells using a CD11b-magnetic bead purification kit (Miltenyi Biotec). BMDMs were generated by in vitro differentiation as described above. For serum, blood was collected from mice and separated by centrifugation. Metabolites were extracted from an equivalent number of CD11b+ cells or BMDMs using dry-ice-temperature 80% methanol or equal volumes of serum diluted to 80% methanol using dry-ice-temperature 100% methanol. Cells and serum were centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. (20,800g) for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were dried down under nitrogen gas, resuspended in 50% methanol, and centrifuged at 13,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to HPLC sample vials and each extract was analysed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography (LC) with tributylamine as an ion pairing reagent. The LC was coupled to a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer running in negative mode (Thermo Quantum Ultra). Specific chromatography conditions and mass spectrometry parameters were as described25. Peak heights of specific metabolites were measured by metabolite-specific multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scans as previously reported26, with the exception of hydroxyglutarate, which was monitored using an MRM scan consisting of a 147 to 129 m/z transition and a collision energy of 13 eV. The mzrock mass spectrometry tool kit (http://code.google.com/p/mzrock/) was used for data analysis and visualization. To minimize the impact of inter-day instrument variation, extracted chromatogram peak heights for a given metabolite were normalized by the maximum sample value for that specific metabolite measured in the same experiment. These relative values were then scaled by 10,000.  DNA methylation analysis  High molecular weight genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from sorted LSK cells from two control and three LysM-KI mice (7 to 15 weeks of age) using the Puregene kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA from two IDH1/IDH2-mutant AML samples was obtained from previously reported, de-identified patient samples5. Two normal CD34+ bone marrow control samples were purchased from AllCells. Institutional review board approval was obtained at Weill Cornell Medical Center and this study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki protocols. DNA was isolated from each primary sample using the Puregene kit (Qiagen). The gDNA was then characterized using a modified reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS)27 approach called enhanced reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (ERRBS)18.  Generation of libraries  In brief 2.5–10 ng gDNA were digested with MspI. Digested DNA was isolated using a standard phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 10mMTris pH8.0. End-repair of digested DNA was performed using T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow DNA polymerase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, dNTPs in T4 DNA ligase buffer (New England Biolabs). After incubation the products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen). Adenylation was performed using Klenow fragment 3′ to 5′ exo minus (New England Biolabs) and dATP in Klenow buffer. Products were purified using MinElute PCR purification columns (Qiagen). Adenylated DNA fragments were ligated with pre-annealed 5-methylcytosine-containing Illumina adapters using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Products were isolated using MinElute columns (Qiagen). Library fragments of 150–250 bp and 250–400 bp were gel-isolated using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). Bisulphite treatment was performed using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research) with the incubation after the addition of CT conversion reagent being conducted in a thermocycler (Eppendorf MasterCycler). Purified products were subjected to PCR amplification using the FastStart High Fidelity PCR System (Roche). PCR products were isolated using AMPure XP beads. All amplified libraries underwent quality control using a Qubit 1.0 fluorometer and a QuantiT dsDNA HS Assay Kit for quantification (Invitrogen) as well as Bioanalyzer visualization (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer). The amplified libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer II or HiSeq2000 per manufacturer’s recommended protocol for 50 bp single-end read runs. Image capture, analysis and base calling were performed using Illumina’s CASAVA 1.7.  Primary data analysis  For alignment of bisulphite treated reads and methylation calls, reads were filtered from the adaptor sequences using CUTADAPT software (http://code.google.com/p/cutadapt/). Adaptor sequence contamination usually occurs towards 3′ ends of some reads. The adaptor matching part of the read was removed if it aligned with the adaptor sequence at least 6 bp and had at most a 0.2 mismatch error rate. Reads were aligned to whole genome using the bismark alignment28 with a maximum of 2 mismatches in a directional manner and only uniquely aligning reads were retained. To call methylation score for a base position, we required that read bases aligning to that position have at least 20 phred quality score and the base position should have at least 10 × coverage. Only CpG dinucleotides that satisfied these coverage and quality criteria were retained for subsequent analysis. Percentage of bisulphite converted Cs (representing unmethylated Cs) and non-converted Cs (representing methylated Cs) were recorded for each C position in a CpG context.  Downstream data analysis  CpG islands, RefSeq genes and repeat sequences for the MM9 genome were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser29. CpG shores were defined as 1,000-bp flanking regions on upstream and downstream of a given CpG island. If a 1,000 bp shore overlapped with another island, then the shore was clipped so that its last base falls before the start of the overlapping CpG island. Similarly, if shores were overlapping they were merged into a single shore. In addition, the genome was partitioned into intergenic, intronic, exonic and promoter regions. Promoter regions were defined as the 2-kilobases window centred around the transcription start sites (TSS) of RefSeq genes. We classified CpG dinucleotides as promoter, intronic, exonic or intergenic based on their overlap with these predefined regions. In addition, we classified CpG dinucleotides as CpG island or shore overlapping.  Calculating differential methylation  Methylation values for genomic regions (intergenic, intronic, exonic and promoters, CpG islands and island shores) between different samples were compared by taking the mean methylation percentage of CpG dinucleotides overlapping those regions. To calculate the correlation between different samples and generate the appropriate scatter plots we required that in any given region at least 3 CpG dinucleotides were covered by reads in both control and KI samples. Testing for differential methylation was performed at both the single-base and predefined region levels. For the base-level comparison, coverage on base positions for each sample was required whereas for the region-level comparison we required at least 3 covered bases on all samples. The number of methylated and unmethylated Cs aligning to each base/region were counted and compared across samples. To determine significant differential methylation between two groups of samples we applied logistic regression and the likelihood ratio test was used. Observed P values were adjusted with the q value method30.  Pathway analysis of differentially methylated regions  Differentially methylated cytosines were annotated to the nearest RefSeq gene and pathway analysis performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems) and the Ingenuity knowledge database as reference.  mRNA expression profiling  RNA was extracted from LSK cell pellets from young mice using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by on-column DNase digest and purification using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen).RNA concentration and quality for all samples was assessed using the RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent). Five nanograms of RNA from each of the samples as well as one Universal Mouse Reference RNA (Stratagene/Agilent) were amplified using the WT-Ovation Pico RNA amplification System Version 1.0 to generate cDNA (Nugen). cDNA samples were biotin labelled according to the Nugen Illumina protocol and hybridized to Mouse WG-6 V2.0 BeadChips which were hybridized, washed and stained according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina) and scanned on the iScan (Illumina). The data files were quantified in GenomeStudio Version 2010.2 (Illumina).  Array processing and data analysis  Microarray data were quality-checked for technical outliers before analysis using the LUMI package31 and quality control metrics in the R/Bioconductor statistical software package (v2.14.1). All samples were of sufficient quality to proceed. Data were imported into the Genespring (v11.5.1, Agilent) software framework for statistical testing and visualization and normalized using a quantile normalization function followed by median centring and logging (log base 2). Of the 45,281 probes, 9,437 did not meet a minimum threshold of expression across both sample groups as defined by being higher than the 20th percentile of measured expression in at least 80 percent of the samples in either the wild-type or KI groups. To assess statistical differences between control and KI sample groups a straightforward t-test (P < 0.05) followed by a fold-change cut-off of 1.5 was used (Supplementary Table 3). False discovery rate (FDR)-corrected32 t-statistics as well as FDR-corrected moderated t-statistics33 were assessed but did not yield any significant results, probably as a result of the increased variability between samples due to the RNA amplification and the small number of replicates in each group. In total, 240 probes were found to be upregulated in KI samples along with 108 downregulated ones. Corrected hypergeometric test statistic following ref. 34 (FDR q < 0.03) was used to find genes in each list that were enriched for gene ontology categories (Supplementary Table 4). To visualize the differences that were found between sample groups, we performed a two-way hierarchical clustering using Pearson-centred distance metrics under average-linkage tree building rules  Recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 have been identified in gliomas, acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) and chondrosarcomas, and share a novel enzymatic property of producing 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) from α-ketoglutarate1-6. Here we report that 2HG-producing IDH mutants can prevent the histone demethylation that is required for lineage-specific progenitor cells to differentiate into terminally differentiated cells. In tumour samples from glioma patients, IDH mutations were associated with a distinct gene expression profile enriched for genes expressed in neural progenitor cells, and this was associated with increased histone methylation. To test whether the ability of IDH mutants to promote histone methylation contributes to a block in cell differentiation in non-transformed cells, we tested the effect of neomorphic IDH mutants on adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Introduction of either mutant IDH or cell-permeable 2HG was associated with repression of the inducible expression of lineage-specific differentiation genes and a block to differentiation. This correlated with a significant increase in repressive histone methylation marks without observable changes in promoter DNA methylation. Gliomas were found to have elevated levels of similar histone repressive marks. Stable transfection of a 2HG-producing mutant IDH into immortalized astrocytes resulted in progressive accumulation of histone methylation. Of the marks examined, increased H3K9 methylation reproducibly preceded a rise in DNA methylation as cells were passaged in culture. Furthermore, we found that the 2HG-inhibitable H3K9 demethylase KDM4C was induced during adipocyte differentiation, and that RNA-interference suppression of KDM4C was sufficient to block differentiation. Together these data demonstrate that 2HG can inhibit histone demethylation and that inhibition of histone demethylation can be sufficient to block the differentiation of non-transformed cells.  The fact that IDH mutations were identified in multiple cancers with disparate tissues of origin suggests that 2HG-producing mutant enzymes probably affect some fundamental cellular processes that facilitate tumour progression. To study the effects of IDH mutations, we collected and performed gene expression microarray analysis on tumour specimens from patients with grade II–III oligodendroglioma. Sequencing results revealed a high frequency of IDH mutations in oligodendroglioma (33 of the samples had the R132 IDH1 mutation, 2 had the R172 IDH2 mutation and 6 were wild type for IDH1/2). Supervised analysis found a statistically enriched gene signature in IDH-mutant samples (q value <10%, fold change >2; Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1) that was independent of tumour grade and recurrence status and survived multiple testing corrections. Gene-ontology analysis identified the regulation of astrocyte and glial differentiation as the top two functional categories enriched in differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Table 2). We previously reported that IDH mutation may promote leukaemogenesis by expanding the haematopoietic progenitor cell population and impairing haematopoietic differentiation7, and that such a phenotype could be attributed at least in part to mutant IDH-induced inhibition of TET2, an α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent enzyme potentially involved in DNA demethylation7,8. Although DNA hypermethylation has been associated with IDH mutation in glioma samples9, no mutations in TET family members have been found in this disease. We explored the possibility that IDH mutation may affect additional αKG-dependent enzymes that contribute to the regulation of cell differentiation.  Figure 1 Figure 1 IDH mutations are associated with dysregulation of glial differentiation and global histone methylation Histone lysine methylation is an integral part of the post-translational modifications of histone tails that are important for chromatin organization and regulation of gene transcription10-13. In vitro 2HG can competitively inhibit a family of αKG-dependent Jumonji-C domain histone demethylases (JHDMs)14,15. To determine whether IDH-associated changes in histone methylation could be observed in cells, we ectopically expressed wild-type or mutant IDH1 or IDH2 in 293T cells and found that mutant IDH1 or IDH2 led to a marked increase in histone methylation compared to the wild-type enzymes. Transient transfection of wild-type IDH2 can also lead to increased 2HG production7. In all of the samples, the magnitude of increase in methylation correlated with the intracellular 2HG levels produced by IDH transfection (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1). To test whether histone lysine methylation was dysregulated in gliomas with IDH mutation, immunohistochemistry analysis of patient oligodendroglioma samples was performed for several well-characterized histone marks. Compared to tumours with wild-type IDH, there was a statistically significant increase in the repressive trimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me3) and an increasing trend in trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) in tumours with IDH1 mutation (Fig. 1c). No statistically significant difference was seen in trimethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me3), a mark associated with active transcription (data not shown). These data suggested that IDH mutations might preferentially affect the regulation of repressive histone methylation marks in vivo.  As IDH mutations were associated with glial tumours of the ‘proneural’ phenotype16, we sought to determine whether the persistence of histone repressive marks promoted by mutant IDH was sufficient to block the differentiation of non-transformed cells. Upon stimulation with a differentiation cocktail, immortalized murine 3T3-L1 cells undergo extensive chromatin remodelling, resulting in their maturation into adipocytes17. 3T3-L1 cells transduced with R172K mutant IDH2 produced 2HG whereas cells transduced with either wild-type IDH2 or vector alone did not (Fig. 2a). All three cell types were then induced to differentiate into adipocytes. After 7 days of differentiation induction, IDH mutant cells had visibly reduced lipid droplet accumulation compared to vector and IDH wild-type cells, as shown by Oil-Red-O staining (Fig. 2b). In separate experiments, stable transfection of R140Q mutant IDH2 also resulted in a block to adipocyte differentiation (data not shown). To determine whether 2HG was sufficient to mediate the effect of mutant IDH on cell differentiation, we synthesized cell-permeable 1-octyl-d-2-hydroxyglutarate (octyl-2HG; Supplementary Fig. 2). Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with octyl-2HG led to a dose-dependent inhibition of lipid accumulation (Fig. 2c). Gene expression analysis showed that despite exposure to a well-standardized differentiation protocol18, IDH mutant cells or cells treated with octyl-2HG exhibited a profound defect in the expression of transcription factors essential for executing adipogenesis (Cebpa and Pparg) and an adipocytic lineage-specific gene (Adipoq) (Fig. 2d, e), suggesting that these cells failed to execute adipocyte differentiation.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Differentiation arrest induced by mutant IDH or 2HG is associated with increased global and promoter-specific H3K9 and H3K27 methylation Cells were harvested for a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using antibodies against H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, before or after 4 days of differentiation induction. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers targeting promoters of Cebpa and Adipoq revealed that at day 4 there was a statistically significant increase in H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 at promoters of both genes in IDH mutant cells (Fig. 2f). These repressive marks also showed a modest but significant increase at gene promoters before differentiation induction. In contrast, quantitative assessment of DNA methylation at promoters of Cebpa and Adipoq by MassARRAY failed to reveal any significant difference between IDH wild-type and mutant cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition to gene-specific changes, we detected a global increase in H3K9 methylation and a reciprocal decrease in H3 acetylation (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 4).  To determine whether IDH mutation was sufficient to induce enhanced repressive histone methylation in central nervous system (CNS)-derived cells and whether it was associated with altered neural gene expression, we retrovirally transduced immortalized normal human astrocytes (NHAs) with either wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1. Compared to parental cells, late-passage cells expressing mutant IDH exhibited elevated levels of a variety of histone methylation marks (Fig. 3a), and this correlated with an enhanced expression of the neural marker nestin (Fig. 3b). IDH mutations have been associated with CpG-island hypermethylation9 and consistent with this we observed that total CpG methylation was increased in IDH mutant cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). Because histone repressive marks can promote DNA methylation and vice versa13, we studied the temporal relationship of histone and DNA methylation in IDH-expressing astrocytes (Fig. 3c–e and Supplementary Fig. 5). The first observable change of the histone marks we examined was H3K9me3. H3K9me3 levels were significantly elevated by passage 12 after cells were infected with mutant IDH. Changes in other histone methylation marks were either delayed and of lower magnitude (H3K27me3 and H3K79me2) or were not observed (H3K4me3). Increases in DNA methylation were never observed before passage 17 and the difference in DNA methylation reached statistical significance only at passage 22.  Figure 3 Figure 3 IDH mutation induces histone methylation increase in CNSderived cells and can alter cell lineage gene expression To test whether the IDH1 R132H mutation could interfere with neural differentiation in the absence of prolonged adaptation in culture, primary neurosphere cultures established from the brains of p16/p19−/− mice were infected with a retroviral construct containing IDH1 R132H mutant, wild-type IDH1 or the vector alone (Supplementary Fig. 6). After infection the cells were re-plated under conditions that promote astrocyte differentiation and induced to differentiate further by treatment with retinoic acid without further passaging. IDH mutant cells failed to induce expression of the astrocytic marker GFAP and exhibited expression of the neural marker β3-tubulin (Fig. 3f). When the differentiation conditions were supplemented with retinoic acid, enhanced expression of the astrocytic marker GFAP was observed in IDH wild-type and vector cells but GFAP expression remained repressed in IDH mutant cells.  The enhancement of H3K9 methylation in mutant IDH-expressing cells from multiple tissues of origin led us to investigate whether this H3K9 methylation might be sufficient to block the ability of non-transformed cells to execute differentiation. Support for this hypothesis came with the discovery that KDM4C (also known as JMJD2C), an H3K9-specific JHDM, was induced in 3T3-L1 cells during differentiation (Fig. 4a). An in vitro histone demethylase assay with recombinant human GST-tagged KDM4C confirmed that KDM4C effectively removed H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 in the presence of αKG. Importantly, the demethylation reaction was inhibited by 2HG in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 7). Given the similarities between 2HG and αKG, the inhibition of KDM4C by 2HG would be predicted to be competitive. Consistently, increasing the concentration of αKG in the reaction mixture reversed the inhibition of H3K9 demethylation by 2HG (Fig. 4c).  Figure 4 Figure 4 2HG-inhibitable H3K9 demethylase KDM4C is required for cell differentiation Finally, to test the possibility that H3K9 demethylation is a required component of adipocyte differentiation, we examined whether blocking the induction of KDM4C was sufficient to impair the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Treatment with three independent short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against KDM4C reduced its expression and enhanced H3K9me3 in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 8). After differentiation induction, cells treated with KDM4C siRNAs exhibited reduced ability to differentiate into adipocytes. Thus the inability to erase repressive H3K9 methylation can be sufficient to impair the differentiation of non-transformed cells.  Biochemical studies suggest that 2HG is a universal inhibitor of JHDM family members14,15; therefore it was interesting to observe that H3K9 demethylation seemed to be more sensitive to mutant IDH-induced suppression than at least some other histone methylation marks. Future investigation of the sensitivity to 2HG inhibition among JHDM family members and/or cellular feedback mechanisms activated after defective histone demethylation will be needed. In addition to the data presented here, evidence is mounting for a direct role of histone methylation in stem cell maintenance, differentiation and tumorigenesis19-23 (see Supplementary Discussion). Our findings support a role for αKG-dependent demethylases in cell differentiation that can be impaired through the cellular accumulation of 2HG produced by IDH mutation.  Go to: METHODS Patient samples, microarray, gene-ontology analysis  Primary oligodendroglioma samples were obtained with approval from the institutional review board at the University of Pennsylvania and were de-identified for the study. For microarray analysis, tumour sample RNA was extracted with Trizol and purified with Qiagen RNeasy, and then assayed on an Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0ST array. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/sam.pdf) was applied to find differentially expressed genes (q value <10% and fold change >2). Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes was done using the DAVID tool (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) using all human genes as a background set.  3T3-L1 cell differentiation, Oil-Red-O staining  3T3-L1 cell differentiation and Oil-Red-O staining were carried out as described previously24. In brief, confluent 3T3-L1 cells were stimulated with a cocktail containing 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μM dexamethasone, 5 μg/ml insulin and 5 μM troglitazone (all from Sigma) to induce differentiation. Cells were maintained in medium with insulin after 2 days of differentiation until ready to be harvested. For Oil-Red-O staining, cells were washed in PBS and then fixed for 20 min at room temperature (25 °C) with 3% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then washed with de-ionized water and stained with Oil-Red-O solution. For quantification, Oil-Red-O staining was dissolved in isopropanol and absorbance was measured at 500 nm.  In vitro histone demethylase assay  The histone demethylase assay was carried out as described previously25. In brief, 4 μg bulk calf thymus histones (Sigma) were incubated with GST-tagged KDM4C (1.42 μg; BPS Bioscience) in a reaction mix containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, protease inhibitors cocktail, 1 mM αKG, 100 μM FeSO4 and 2 mM ascorbic acid at 37 °C for 4 h, in the absence or presence of various concentrations of d-2HG or l-2HG (Sigma). Reaction mixtures were analysed by western blotting using specific antibodies.  Cell culture, transfection and transduction, generation of cell lines  293T cells, NHA cells immortalized by E6/E7/hTERT (provided by R. Pieper26) and 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; CellGro). For expression of wild-type and mutant IDH1/2 in 293T cells, transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For generation of IDH2 retrovirus and transduction of 3T3-L1 cells, supernatant from 293T cells transfected with pCL-Eco helper virus and plasmids was collected after 72 h, filtered and applied to cells overnight. For generating 3T3-L1 cell lines with stable expression of wild-type or mutant IDH2, cells were grown in 2.5 μg ml−1 puromycin for 7 days after retroviral transduction. Pooled populations of puromycin-resistant cells were obtained, and then continuously cultured in puromycin. For generation of IDH1 retrovirus and transduction of NHA cells, GP2-293 cells (Clontech, 631458) were calcium phosphate transfected with equal amounts of pVSV-G (Clontech, 631512) and plasmids. Virus was harvested at day 2 and day 3 after transfection and placed on logarithmically growing cells. After infection, cells were placed in 800 μmg ml−1 G418 (Invitrogen) to generate stable cell lines. For siRNA knockdown of KDM4C, transfections were performed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen), using siRNAs targeting KDM4C (#1: sense, 5′-GCUUGAAUCUCCCAAGAUATT-3′; antisense, 5′-UAUCUU GGGAGAUUCAAGCTT-3′; #2: sense, 5′-CAAAGUAUCUUGGAUCAAATT-3′; antisense, 5′-UUUGAUCCAAGAUACUUUGCC-3′; #3: sense, 5′-GAGGAGUU UCGGGAGUUCAACAAAU-3′; antisense, 5′-AUUUGUUGAACUCCCGAA ACUCCUC-3′) or a non-targeting control (Dharmacon, #D-001810-01-20) at a concentration of 40 nM.  Mutational analysis  For IDH mutation analysis, tumour genomic DNA was extracted and the regions surrounding IDH1 codon 132 and IDH2 codons 140 and 172 were amplified by PCR followed by sequencing. IDH1 analysis used forward primer 5′-ACCAAATGGCACCATACGA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTCATACC TTGCTTAATGGGTGT-3′ for amplification, and primer 5′-CGGTCTTCAGAG AAGCCATT-3′ for sequencing1. IDH2 analysis used forward primer 5′-CAG AGACAAGAGGATGGCTAGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTCTGCCTGTG TTGTTGCTTG-3′ for amplification, and the same forward primer for sequencing27. Out of the 42 tumours analysed, 41 had sufficient high quality genomic DNA for discerning IDH mutation status. The one sample unable to be classified as either IDH wild type or mutant was excluded from further analysis.  Plasmid construction  The cDNA clone of human IDH1 (BC012846.1) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection in pCMV-Sport6, and human IDH2 (BC009244) was purchased from Invitrogen in pOTB7. Standard site-directed mutagenesis techniques were used to generate IDH1 R132H by introducing a G395A base-pair change in the IDH1 open reading frame (ORF). IDH2 R172K was made by introducing a G515A change in the IDH2 ORF, while IDH2 R140Q was made with a G419A alteration. Wild-type and mutant sequences were then subcloned into LPC vector. All sequences were confirmed by direct sequencing before expression in 293T cells and retrovirus generation. Retroviral constructs used for neurosphere infection were generated by excising wild-type IDH1 and IDH1 R132H with NotI and PacI restriction enzymes from the previously made vectors and incorporating into the pQCXIH (Clontech, 631516) retroviral vector.  Histone extraction and western blotting  For histone acid extraction, cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, protease inhibitors) for 1 h. H2SO4 was added to 0.2 N overnight at 4 °C with rotation. After spinning down and collecting supernatant, proteins were precipitated in 33% TCA, washed with acetone, and resuspended in de-ionized water. For whole-cell lysates, cells were lysed and sonicated in standard RIPA buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01 M Tris pH 8.0 and 0.14 M NaCl), and lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000g at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and measured for total protein concentration. For western blotting, lysates were separated by SDS–PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked in 5% non-fat milk in PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20, probed with primary antibodies and detected with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (GE Healthcare, NA934V and NA931V). Primary antibodies used were: anti-IDH1 (Proteintech, 12332-1-AP), anti-IDH2 (Abcam, ab55271), anti-GST tag (Millipore, 05-311), anti-H3K9me2 (Cell Signaling Tech, 9753), anti-H3K9me3 (Abcam, ab8898), anti-H3K36me3 (Abcam, ab9050), anti-H3K27me3 (Millipore, 17-622), anti-H3K4me3 (Millipore, 17-614), anti-H3K79me2 (Cell Signaling Tech, 9757), anti-KDM4C (Abcam, ab85454), anti-acetyl H3 (Upstate, 06-599), anti-H3 (Cell Signaling Tech, 4499), anti-tubulin (Sigma, T9026), anti-GFAP (Cell Signaling Tech, 3670), anti-β3-tubulin (Cell Signaling Tech, 5666), anti-p85 (Millipore, 06-195), anti-nestin (Millipore, MAB5326), anti-β-actin (Sigma, A5316). Anti-IDH1 R132H mutant antibody was a gift from Agios Pharmaceuticals. Quantification of western blot band intensity was performed using Image J software according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Metabolite extraction, GC–MS  After gentle removal of culture medium, cells were rapidly quenched with ice-cold 80% methanol and incubated at −80 °C for 20 min. After sonication, extracts were then centrifuged at 14,000g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated protein and the aqueous metabolites in the supernatant layer were dried under nitrogen gas. For 293T cells, organic acids were further purified by redissolving the dried extract in de-ionized water, followed by elution from an AG-1 X8 100–200 anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad) in 3 N HCl after washing with five column volumes.  For GC–MS analysis, dried extracts were redissolved in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA; Regis) and heated for 75 min at 70 °C to derivatize metabolites. Samples were then injected into an Agilent 7890A GC with an HP-5MS capillary column, connected to an Agilent 5975 C mass selective detector operating in splitless mode using electron impact ionization with ionizing voltage of −70 eV and electron multiplier set to 1,060 V. GC temperature was started at 100 °C for 3 min, ramped up to 230 °C at 4 °C min−1 and held for 4 min, then ramped up to 300 °C and held for 5 min. Mass range of 50–500 amu was recorded at 2.71 scans per second. Identification of the 2HG metabolite peak was confirmed using standards obtained from Sigma. The 2HG and glutamate signal intensities were quantified by integration of peak areas.  Quantitative real-time PCR  RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). After incubating with DNase, cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed on a 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using Taqman Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression data was normalized to 18S rRNA.  ChIP  ChIP was performed with the Millipore Magna ChIP G kit (Millipore, 17-611). In brief, 2,000,000 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with cold PBS, cells were centrifuged and lysed in 500 μl SDS lysis buffer for 10 min on ice. Lysate was then sonicated using Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode) to shear DNA to approximately 200–600 bp. Samples were spun down and 50 μl of the supernatant was used for each immuno-precipitation overnight with magnetic beads after 10× dilution. Primary antibodies (3 μg per ChIP) used were: anti-H3K9me3 (Abcam, ab8898) and anti-H3K27me3 (Millipore, 17-622). Normal rabbit IgG (Millipore, 12-370) was used as control and showed minimal enrichment. The next day, samples were washed in low-salt immune complex buffer, high-salt immune complex buffer, LiCl immune complex buffer and TE buffer. Histone complexes were eluted in elution buffer plus proteinase K for 2 h at 65 °C. DNA was recovered using columns. Quantitative PCR was performed on purified DNA samples. Primers used are: Adipoq forward, 5′-ATGGCTGAACCACACAGCTTCA-3′; reverse, 5′-AGGGGTCAGGAGA CCTCCCTTT-3′; Cebpa forward, 5′-CTGGAAGTGGGTGACTTAGAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGTGGGGAGCATAGTGCTAG-3′. Data points (Ct) are converted to percentage of input.  Quantitative DNA methylation analysis  Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using EpiTyper by MassARRAY (Sequenom) was performed on bisulphite-converted DNA extracted from 3T3-L1 cells. MassARRAY primer design was done as previously described28,29.  Immunohistochemistry  Immunohistochemistry detection was performed using Discovery XT processor (Ventana Medical Systems). The tissue sections were blocked for 30 min in 10% normal goat serum in 0.2% BSA/PBS, followed by incubation for 5 h with 0.1 μg ml−1 of the rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K9me3 (Abcam, ab8898) or 1 μg ml−1 rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K27me3 (Millipore, 07-449) antibodies and incubation for 60 min with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector labs, PK6101) at 1:200 dilution. The detection was performed with the DAB-MAP kit (Ventana Medical Systems). The entire slides were scanned by Zeiss Mirax Scan (Carl Zeiss) using a X20/0.8 objective. The scanned image was exported into image analysis software, Metamorph (Molecular Devices). The colour threshold for DAB-positive nuclei was determined and set for all images. Areas above the threshold for the DAB signal and for haematoxylin-counterstained total nuclei were measured in an automated fashion. The ratio between the two parameters were calculated and analysed for statistical significance.  Synthesis of 1-octyl-d-2-hydroxyglutarate  Commercial R(-)-tetrahydro-5-oxofuran-2-carboxylic acid (140 mg, 1.076 mmol) was dissolved in H2O (1 ml), cooled to 0 °C and treated with 1 N KOH (2.16 ml, 2.15 mmol). The resulting solution was stirred at this temperature for 5 min and at ambient temperature for 2 h. It was then concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure and dried. The residue was dissolved in trifluoroacetic anhydride (8 ml) at 0 °C, stirred for 30 min at 0 °C, for 2 h at room temperature, then the volatiles were evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dried and dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (6 ml). Octanol (0.3 ml, 2.1 eq.) was added to the solution at 0 °C and the mixture was stirred for an overnight period at ambient temperature. Water was added to quench the reaction, and the mixture extracted with EtOAc. The combined extracts were dried over MgSO4, concentrated and purified by Flash chromatography (EtOAc:hexane 1:3 and 1:1) to give 1-octyl-d-2-hydroxyglutarate (110 mg, 39%).  Neurosphere isolation, culture and differentiation  Six days postpartum Ink4a/Arf null (p16/p19−/−) mice were killed, with the isolated subventricular zones subjected to chemical (Pronase E, Calbiochem 7433-2) and mechanical dissociation to obtain a single-cell suspension in full neurobasal medium (Neurobasal medium, GIBCO 21103; B27 supplement without retinoic acid, GIBCO 12587-010; Glutamax, GIBCO 35050; 20 ng ml−1 EGF, R&D Systems 236-EG; 20 ng ml−1 basic FGF, Millipore GF003). On the next day the cells were spun down and re-suspended in fresh medium, and once neurospheres had formed in culture, the spheres were collected and chemically dissociated (Accumax, Innovative Cell Technologies AM105) back into single cells in fresh medium.  One day after final infection, infected neurospheres and a non-infected control were placed in 400 mg μl−1 Hygromycin B (InvivoGen, ant-hg-1). Once selection was complete, isogenic cell lines maintained in full neurobasal medium were chemically dissociated into single cells and plated at the same density in full neurobasal medium with increasing concentrations of retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, R2625). Seventy-two hours later cells were harvested, and expression of proteins was analysed by western blotting.  Measurement of total CpG methylation  DNA methylation was assessed as previously described30. In brief, 1 × 106 NHA cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were then treated with 2 N HCl for 20 min at room temperature and subsequently neutralized with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cells were incubated with anti-5-methylcytosine antibody (Calbiochem, NA 81) at 1:100 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibody coupled with ALEXA FLUOR 488 (Invitrogen) for 30 min in the dark. Flow cytometry was done using Becton Dickinson Calibur flow cytometer and analysed using FlowJo software.  Statistical analysis  All statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-test (two-sample equal variance; two-tailed distribution).  Mutations in metabolic enzymes, including isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2, in cancer strongly implicate altered metabolism in tumorigenesis. IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze the interconversion of isocitrate and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). 2OG is a TCA cycle intermediate and an essential cofactor for many enzymes, including JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases, TET 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases, and EglN prolyl-4-hydroxylases. Cancer-associated IDH mutations alter the enzymes such that they reduce 2OG to the structurally similar metabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2HG]. Here we review what is known about the molecular mechanisms of transformation by mutant IDH and discuss their implications for the development of targeted therapies to treat IDH mutant malignancies.  Keywords: 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, cancer metabolism, chondrosarcoma, glioma, isocitrate dehydrogenase, leukemia Cellular metabolism has been hypothesized to play a central role in cancer since the observation made almost a century ago by Otto Warburg (Warburg 1956) that cancer cells preferentially generate energy by metabolizing glucose to lactate. Even in the presence of oxygen, cancer cells switch from generating ATP by the highly energy-efficient process of oxidative phosphorylation to the much less efficient process of glycolysis (Vander Heiden et al. 2009; Dang 2012). Why this switch occurs has long been a mystery, although the observation that normal cells use “aerobic glycolysis” during periods of increased proliferation supports the hypothesis that this metabolic switch is an important feature of rapidly dividing cells (Locasale and Cantley 2011; Lunt and Vander Heiden 2011). Recent work suggests that aerobic glycolysis facilitates cellular transformation by producing the high levels of glycolytic intermediates that proliferating cells need for the biosynthesis of lipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids. Moreover, metabolic reprogramming appears to be sufficient to mediate tumorigenesis in some systems (Lyssiotis and Cantley 2012; Sebastian et al. 2012). Nevertheless, whether altered cellular metabolism is a cause of cancer or merely an adaptive response of cancer cells in the face of accelerated cell proliferation is still a topic of some debate.  The recent identification of cancer-associated mutations in three metabolic enzymes suggests that altered cellular metabolism can indeed be a cause of some cancers (Pollard et al. 2003; King et al. 2006; Raimundo et al. 2011). Two of these enzymes, fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), are bone fide tumor suppressors, and loss-of-function mutations in FH and SDH have been identified in various cancers, including renal cell carcinomas and paragangliomas. The third mutated enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), is a more complicated case. Mutations in two isoforms of IDH, IDH1 and IDH2, are common in a diverse array of cancers, including gliomas and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (Dang et al. 2010). The mutant enzymes are not catalytically inactive. Rather, the cancer-associated mutations alter the catalytic activity of the enzymes such that they produce high levels of a metabolite, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2HG], which is normally found at very low levels in cells (Dang et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2010). How this aberrant enzymatic activity contributes to cellular transformation is an area of intense interest and some controversy, and several hypotheses have been proposed for how IDH mutations promote tumorigenesis. It has been suggested that (R)-2HG functions as an “oncometabolite” to promote cellular transformation, perhaps by altering the redox state of cells or modulating the activity of metabolic and epigenetic tumor suppressor enzymes that use the structurally similar metabolite α-ketoglutarate as a cosubstrate (Reitman and Yan 2010; Yen et al. 2010; Kaelin 2011). Others have posited that loss of IDH activity from either loss of the wild-type allele or gain of a dominant-negative mutant allele alters normal mitochondrial function and promotes the metabolic switch of cancer cells to glycolysis (Leonardi et al. 2012; Oermann et al. 2012).  Here, we review the spectrum of tumors that harbor IDH mutations and discuss what has been learned to date about how mutant IDH and (R)-2HG contribute to tumorigenesis. We also discuss the potential of mutant IDH as a therapeutic target in cancer and discuss some of the outstanding questions about mutant IDH biology that warrant further investigation.  Go to: Normal functions of the IDH family of metabolic enzymes Eukaryotic cells express three different isoforms of IDH (Fig. 1; Dalziel 1980). IDH1 and IDH2 are homodimeric NADP+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to produce α-ketoglutarate (also known as 2-oxoglutarate [2OG]), NADPH, and CO2 (Fig. 2). IDH3 is a structurally unrelated heterotetrameric NAD+-dependent enzyme that similarly decarboxylates isocitrate and produces 2OG, NADH, and CO2. The reactions catalyzed by IDH1 and IDH2 are reversible, and the directionality of the reactions therefore depends in large part on the relative Km values of the forward and reverse reactions and the relative levels of isocitrate and 2OG in the cell (Lemons et al. 2010). The reaction catalyzed by IDH3, on the other hand, is irreversible under physiologic conditions and is principally regulated by substrate availability and positive and negative allosteric effectors. Calcium, ADP, and citrate activate IDH3, whereas ATP, NADH, and NADPH inhibit this enzyme (Gabriel et al. 1986).  Figure 1. Figure 1. The role of the IDH family of enzymes in the TCA cycle. Shown here are the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic reactions that involve IDH; also shown are the principal mechanisms of entry of glucose and glutamine-derived carbon molecules into the TCA cycle. ... Figure 2. Figure 2. Reactions catalyzed by wild-type and mutant IDH1 and IDH2. Wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze a two-step reaction (indicated by blue arrows). The first step involves the oxidation of isocitrate to the unstable intermediate oxalosuccinate. In this reaction, ... The different IDH isoforms have overlapping, but nonredundant, roles in cellular metabolism (Fig. 1; Mailloux et al. 2007; Reitman and Yan 2010). IDH1 localizes to the cytoplasm and peroxisomes and plays a role in promoting the activity of the numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear dioxygenases that require 2OG as a cosubstrate (Hausinger 2004). Another important function of IDH1 is the generation of nonmitochondrial NADPH. NADPH provides critical reducing equivalents needed for lipid biosynthesis and is also an essential antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress and radiation damage (Jo et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2007). Finally, as the reaction catalyzed by IDH1 is reversible, IDH1 is capable of catalyzing the reductive carboxylation of 2OG to isocitrate, which can then be further metabolized to acetyl-CoA to support lipid biosynthesis (Koh et al. 2004; Filipp et al. 2012; Metallo et al. 2012).  IDH2 and IDH3, in contrast, localize to the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 1). IDH3 plays a central role in mitochondrial respiration by catalyzing one of the rate-limiting steps of the TCA cycle. The 2OG produced by IDH3 is further metabolized to succinate, and the NADH is used by the electron transport chain to generate ATP (Barnes et al. 1971). It is not clear whether IDH2 likewise contributes to flux through the TCA cycle. Rather, IDH2 is thought to regulate energy metabolism by modulating the relative abundance of isocitrate and 2OG in the mitochondria (DeBerardinis et al. 2008). Under conditions where levels of mitochondrial glutamate are high or under hypoxic conditions when glucose-dependent citrate production is compromised, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) converts glutamate to 2OG (Sazanov and Jackson 1994; Comte et al. 2002). The resultant increase in the 2OG:isocitrate ratio favors the reverse IDH2 reaction, which results in conversion of 2OG and NADPH to isocitrate and NADP+. This isocitrate can then be fed into the TCA cycle by IDH3, which converts the isocitrate back to 2OG and produces additional NADH, or isomerized by aconitase to produce citrate. Citrate, in addition to being a TCA cycle intermediate, is a critical metabolite required for fatty acid biosynthesis. Accordingly, IDH2-mediated reductive carboxylation of 2OG plays an important role in sustaining energy production and promoting cell proliferation during periods of hypoxia (Wise et al. 2011; Filipp et al. 2012). IDH2, as an important source of mitochondrial NADPH, also plays a critical role in the protection of cells from mitochondrial-specific oxidative stress, such as that generated by the electron transport chain (Lee et al. 2004, 2007).  Go to: IDH mutations in human cancer Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly invasive brain tumor that is notoriously refractory to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In 2008, in an effort to identify novel therapeutic targets in GBM, Parsons et al. (2008) undertook a landmark genomic sequencing effort of 22 adult primary and secondary GBM tumors. They identified recurrent somatic mutations at Arg132 of IDH1 that were present in five of the six secondary GBMs but none of the 16 primary GBMs included in the study. Several follow-up sequencing studies of malignant gliomas confirmed that IDH1 Arg132 mutations are very common in specific types of adult brain tumors, occurring in >70% of adult grade II and grade III gliomas and >80% of adult secondary GBMs (Balss et al. 2008; Bleeker et al. 2009). Moreover, many of the grade II/III gliomas and secondary GBMs that are IDH1 wild type harbor mutations at the analogous codon, Arg172, of IDH2 (Hartmann et al. 2009; Yan et al. 2009). Overall, 80%–90% of adult grade II/III gliomas and secondary GBMs harbor mutations at either Arg132 of IDH1 or Arg172 of IDH2 (Table 1; Chang et al. 2011). Conversely, <10% of primary GBMs and pediatric GBMs harbor IDH mutations, and no IDH mutations have been identified to date in brain tumors of nonglial subtypes (Balss et al. 2008; Yan et al. 2009; Capper et al. 2010; Byeon et al. 2012).  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of IDH1 and IDH2 mutant alleles in human cancers In 2009, Mardis et al. (2009) performed whole-genome sequencing of a case of normal karyotype AML (NK-AML) and identified a mutation at Arg132 of IDH1. Further sequencing efforts confirmed that IDH mutations are highly recurrent in clonal myeloid disorders. Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are present in 5%–20% of cases of de novo NK-AML and in 10%–20% of cases of secondary AML that result from leukemic transformation of “premalignant” myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) (Kosmider et al. 2010; Pardanani et al. 2010; Tefferi et al. 2010; Patnaik et al. 2012; Rakheja et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2012). IDH mutations are also present, albeit at a lower frequency (5%–10%), in chronic-phase MDS and MPN but are rare in translocation-positive AML (Mardis et al. 2009; Abbas et al. 2010). IDH2 mutations are also present in 10%–40% of cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) but are uncommon in other T- or B-cell lymphoid malignancies (Cairns et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012).  IDH mutations have been found in a number of other solid tumors besides gliomas. Over 50% of chondrosarcomas harbor IDH mutations (Amary et al. 2011a; Arai et al. 2012; Meijer et al. 2012), and IDH mutations have been linked to the pathogenesis of the enchondromatosis syndromes Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome (Pansuriya et al. 2010). Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome are rare nonhereditary pediatric cancer predisposition syndromes in which affected children develop cartilaginous tumors as their developing bones undergo endochondral ossification. Recently, sequencing analysis has determined that 40%–90% of the tumors in these patients harbor mutations at Arg132 of IDH1 or Arg172 of IDH2 (Amary et al. 2011b; Pansuriya et al. 2011). Interestingly, many of these patients develop multiple independent IDH mutant tumors but express wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 in their normal tissues. This suggests that their IDH mutations are occurring during embryonic development and that their tumors are a consequence of somatic mosaicism of mutant IDH-expressing cells. Interestingly, Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome appear to be associated with an increased risk of secondary neoplasms; in particular, gliomas and AML. IDH mutations have also been found in 10%–20% of cholangiocarcinomas as well as a few rare cases of paraganglioma, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer (Sjoblom et al. 2006; Bleeker et al. 2009; Kang et al. 2009; Gaal et al. 2010; Sequist et al. 2011; Borger et al. 2012).  Among the cancers associated with IDH mutations, the mutations appear to have a predilection for certain tumor subtypes or locations. In cholangiocarcinoma, the frequency of IDH mutations in intrahepatic tumors is 28%, whereas the frequency is only 7% in extrahepatic tumors (Borger et al. 2012). In chondrosarcomas, IDH mutations appear to be exclusive to central, periosteal, and dedifferentiated tumors, with no IDH mutations having been identified to date in peripheral chondrosarcomas or other cartilaginous tumors (Amary et al. 2011a; Arai et al. 2012).  IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur at different frequencies in different tumor types (Table 1). In gliomas, >80% of IDH mutations occur at Arg132 of IDH1 and result in replacement of the arginine residue with a histidine (IDH1 R132H) (Balss et al. 2008; Yan et al. 2009; Chang et al. 2011). In cholangiocarcinomas and chondrosarcomas, IDH1 Arg132 mutations are also far more common than IDH2 Arg172 mutations, although the IDH1 mutations in these tumors most often result in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution (IDH1 R132C) (Amary et al. 2011a; Arai et al. 2012; Borger et al. 2012). This is in contrast to AML, where IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur at similar frequencies (Abbas et al. 2010; Marcucci et al. 2010; Paschka et al. 2010; Koszarska et al. 2012). The single most common IDH mutation in AML is the replacement of Arg140 of IDH2 with a glutamine (IDH2 R140Q). Interestingly, IDH2 Arg140 mutations have not been found in gliomas, cholangiocarcinomas, or chondrosarcomas. However, an IDH1 mutation analogous to Arg140 of IDH2, IDH1 Arg100, has been described in rare cases of glioma (Pusch et al. 2011). In AITL, all of the IDH mutations reported to date are IDH2 mutations, with >90% occurring at IDH2 Arg172 (Cairns et al. 2012). Why the frequency of these different amino acid substitutions is so variable in different tumors is not known. It is also worth noting that IDH1 and IDH2 mutations appear to be mutually exclusive. There are no reported cases of brain tumors harboring both mutations, and although rare cases of IDH1/IDH2 double mutant AML have been reported, it is not clear whether these mutations occur in the same or different leukemic subclones (Paschka et al. 2010).  The prognostic significance of IDH mutations is not consistent across all tumor types. In the case of GBM, IDH mutations appear to confer a more favorable prognosis, with a median survival for patients with IDH mutant GBM of 31 mo, as compared with a median survival of 15 mo for patients with IDH wild-type GBM (Yan et al. 2009; SongTao et al. 2012). Whether this difference is driven by the IDH mutational status of the tumors or reflects other fundamental biological differences between primary and secondary GBM is as yet unclear. In AML, the prognostic significance of IDH mutations is still somewhat ambiguous. Several studies have reported that IDH mutational status does not impact prognosis in AML, whereas other studies have found that IDH mutations are associated with an increased or decreased risk of disease relapse when compared with IDH wild-type disease, depending on the specific patient population examined (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2011; Rakheja et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2012). In MDS and MPN, IDH mutations have been consistently found to be markers of poor prognosis. Furthermore, the observation that the frequency of IDH mutations is higher in late stage MPN and high-risk MDS (20%) than in early stage and low-risk disease (<4%), coupled with the observation that IDH mutations are frequently present in secondary AML, has lead to speculation that IDH mutations are involved in the progression of chronic MDS and MPN to full-blown leukemia. (Tefferi et al. 2010, 2012; Thol et al. 2010; Patnaik et al. 2012).  Go to: Catalytic activity of mutant IDH When IDH mutations were first identified in cancer, they were hypothesized to contribute to tumorigenesis by causing loss of function and dominant-negative inhibition of wild-type IDH activity (Yan et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2009). However, subsequent studies found that, on the contrary, tumor-associated IDH mutations cause a gain of function (Dang et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2010). The mutations are all located in the active sites of the enzymes. Arg100 and Arg132 in IDH1 and Arg140 and Arg172 in IDH2 form hydrogen bonds with the α-carboxyl and β-carboxyl groups of isocitrate and mediate isocitrate binding (Xu et al. 2004). Mutations at these residues decrease the binding affinity of the enzyme active sites for isocitrate and increase their binding affinity for NADPH, which significantly abrogates the normal oxidative decarboxylation activity of the enzymes (Dang et al. 2009). In addition to abrogating the “forward” catalytic activity of IDH, the mutations change the conformation of the enzyme active site such that the “reverse” reaction is only a partial reaction, one in which 2OG is reduced but not carboxylated. This results in conversion of 2OG to (R)-2HG rather than isocitrate (Fig. 2). In short, IDH mutations cause the reverse IDH reaction to be favored but partially disrupted, leading to high-level production of (R)-2HG.  Interestingly, although IDH1 and IDH2 mutants both produce (R)-2HG, they appear to have somewhat distinct enzymatic properties. Cells that express mutant IDH1 accumulate less (R)-2HG than do mutant IDH2-expressing cells (Ward et al. 2013). Moreover, (R)-2HG production by mutant IDH1 is enhanced by coexpression of wild-type IDH1, whereas mutant IDH2-expressing cells accumulate high levels of (R)-2HG independent of wild-type IDH2 activity. It has been hypothesized that the lower production of (R)-2HG by mutant IDH1 is due to the fact that cytoplasmic 2OG is limiting in cells, whereas mitochondrial 2OG is not. Consistent with this model, the addition of a mitochondrial localization signal to mutant IDH1 results in enhanced (R)-2HG production. Interestingly, mutant IDH1 forms heterodimers with wild-type IDH1, but mutant IDH2 does not bind wild-type IDH2 (Dang et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2013). It has been hypothesized that heterodimerization of wild-type and mutant IDH1 in the cytoplasm provides the mutant subunit with a local source of 2OG that can then be metabolized to (R)-2HG. Consistent with this model, it has recently been reported that loss of the wild-type IDH1 allele in IDH1 mutant gliomas is associated with significantly lower tumor levels of (R)-2HG than are seen in heterozygous IDH1 mutant tumors (Jin et al. 2013).  Go to: Mutant IDH is an oncogene In a number of different in vitro transformation assays, expression of mutant IDH promotes the proliferation and inhibits the differentiation of cells. Expression of a tumor-derived IDH1 mutant (IDH1 R132H), but not a catalytically inactive form of the mutant enzyme, enhances the proliferation and soft agar colony formation of immortalized human astrocytes and confers growth factor independence and blocks the erythropoietin-induced differentiation of TF-1 cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line (Koivunen et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013). Expression of mutant IDH is also able to inhibit the differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and the differentiation of primary murine hematopoietic stem cells and immortalized murine myeloid progenitor cells (Figueroa et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013).  Although mutant IDH is able to promote cellular transformation in vitro, the mutant enzyme does not appear to be sufficient to transform primary cells in vivo. Sasaki et al. (2012a,b) have characterized the phenotype of a conditional knock-in mouse model in which they inserted IDH1 R132H into the endogenous IDH1 locus and expressed mutant IDH in either the brains or the hematopoietic systems of mice. Brain-specific expression of IDH1 R132H during embryogenesis results in perinatal lethality of the mice from cerebral hemorrhage without evidence of underlying malignancy (Sasaki et al. 2012a). Although it is possible that the mice would develop brain tumors if they lived longer, the hematopoietic-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, which have a normal life span, similarly do not develop malignancy (Sasaki et al. 2012b).  Despite the lack of a cancer phenotype in the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, the hematopoietic stem cell phenotype of the mice does provide some insights into how mutant IDH contributes to tumorigenesis. Although IDH1 R132H-expressing bone marrow cells are not immortalized, the mice do show selective expansion of their hematopoietic stem and early progenitor compartments but not their committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitor compartments. This observation is quite interesting given the distinct self-renewal properties of these different cell types. Normal committed progenitors are unable to self-renew and are consigned to undergo further differentiation, whereas stem cells and early progenitors have inherent self-renewal capabilities (Chao et al. 2008; Orford and Scadden 2008; Seita and Weissman 2010). When stem cells and early progenitors divide, they make the decision to undergo either symmetric division, in which both daughter cells are identical to the original cell, or asymmetric division, in which one daughter cell is identical to the original cell and the other is committed to undergoing further differentiation. The balance between symmetric and asymmetric cell division is crucial to cellular homeostasis. Excessive symmetric division causes inappropriate expansion of stem cell compartments, whereas excessive asymmetric division results in stem cell exhaustion (Jacob and Osato 2009; Marciniak-Czochra et al. 2009; Matsumoto and Nakayama 2013). The observation that only stem and early progenitor cells are expanded in the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice suggests that mutant IDH promotes leukemogenesis by increasing symmetric division within a population of cells that have inherent self-renewal capacity but that mutant IDH is not, by itself, able to immortalize self-renewing cells or bestow self-renewal upon more differentiated cells. This observation has important biological implications. The limited ability of mutant IDH to promote the proliferation of primary cells suggests that the specific cell lineage in which the IDH mutation occurs significantly influences the ability of the mutation to contribute to transformation. An IDH mutation in a committed progenitor cell would likely not confer a proliferative advantage to that cell, whereas the same mutation in a more primitive cell would contribute to clonal expansion.  It is also notable that hematopoietic stem cells isolated from IDH1 R132H knock-in mice are able to differentiate normally in vitro and are able to competitively repopulate the bone marrow of transplanted recipient mice. This suggests that expression of mutant IDH has little if any effect on cellular differentiation in otherwise normal hematopoietic cells. This limited ability of mutant IDH to block the differentiation of normal primary cells suggests that other specific mutations that cooperate with mutant IDH to block cellular differentiation are likely to be required to bring about the maturation arrest that is characteristic of leukemia cells.  Go to: Mutant IDH-derived (R)-2HG is an oncometabolite 2HG is a five-carbon dicarboxylic acid with a chiral center at the second carbon atom (Fig. 2). There are therefore two possible enantiomers of 2HG: (R)-2HG [otherwise known as (D)-2HG] and (S)-2HG [otherwise known as (L)-2HG]. (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG are both byproducts of normal mitochondrial metabolism (Kranendijk et al. 2012). The principal source of (R)-2HG in IDH wild-type cells is a reaction catalyzed by hydroxyacid–oxoacid transhydrogenase (HOT) (Struys et al. 2005b). HOT converts γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) to succinic semialdehyde (SSA), with concomitant reduction of 2OG to (R)-2HG. (S)-2HG is generated during conversion of oxaloacetate to (L)-malate by (L)-malate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the TCA cycle (Rzem et al. 2007).  (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG are believed to be unwanted byproducts of cellular metabolism, and their intracellular levels in normal cells are maintained at <0.1 mM. 2HG is prevented from accumulating in cells by the actions of two enzymes—(D)-2HG and (L)-2HG dehydrogenase (2HGDH)—that convert (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG, respectively, back to 2OG (Struys et al. 2005a; Steenweg et al. 2010). There is currently no known physiologic role for either enantiomer in normal metabolism.  IDH mutants exclusively produce the (R) enantiomer of 2HG, and the levels of (R)-2HG in IDH mutant tumors can be extremely elevated, ranging from 1 mM to as high as 30 mM (Dang et al. 2009; Gross et al. 2010; Choi et al. 2012). These high levels of (R)-2HG appear to be a consequence of a significant imbalance between (R)-2HG production and metabolism in tumor cells. IDH1 R132H has an estimated catalytic rate (Kcat) of 1.0 × 103 sec−1 (Dang et al. 2009), whereas recombinant D2HGDH has an estimated Kcat of 0.8 sec−1 (Engqvist et al. 2009). It is therefore likely that mutant IDH overwhelms the capacity of D2HGDH to oxidize the excess (R)-2HG back to 2OG. This model is supported by the observation that in patients with type I (D)-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D2HGA), an inborn neurometabolic disorder caused by germline mutations in D2HGDH, levels of (R)-2HG are elevated but to a much lesser extent than is observed in IDH mutant tumors (Wickenhagen et al. 2009). Type II D2HGA, which is caused by germline IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R140G mutations, is associated with higher levels of (R)-2HG and a more severe clinical course (Kranendijk et al. 2010, 2011). Interestingly, D2HGA is not associated with an increased incidence of cancer. It is important to note, however, that many patients with severe D2HGA die in infancy and early childhood, and it is therefore difficult to make definitive conclusions about an association between high levels of (R)-2HG and long-term susceptibility to cancer.  High intracellular concentrations of (R)-2HG are sufficient to mediate the in vitro transforming effects of mutant IDH. Treatment of TF-1 leukemia cells with concentrations of a cell-permeable form of (R)-2HG that achieve tumor-relevant intracellular levels is able to recapitulate the effects of mutant IDH expression (Losman et al. 2013), and treatment of cells with cell-permeable (R)-2HG is able to inhibit the differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and immortalized murine myeloid progenitor cells (Lu et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013). Furthermore, tumor cells that harbor IDH mutations and produce high levels of (R)-2HG appear to require continuous (R)-2HG to remain transformed. Withdrawal of (R)-2HG from TF-1 leukemia cells transformed by cell-permeable (R)-2HG reverses their growth factor independence and restores their ability to differentiate (Losman et al. 2013), and inhibition of mutant IDH1 expression in glioma cell lines that harbor naturally occurring IDH1 R132H mutations impairs in vitro colony formation and in vivo tumor engraftment by the cells (Rohle et al. 2013). Finally, highly potent and specific inhibitors of mutant IDH have been developed that are able to reverse the transformation of TF-1 cells expressing IDH1 R132H and IDH2 R140Q (Popovici-Muller et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013). These inhibitors also induce the differentiation of primary IDH mutant human leukemia cells in vitro and recapitulate the effects of suppression of IDH1 R132H expression in IDH mutant glioma cell lines in vitro and in vivo (Rohle et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013). Taken together, these findings suggest that the transforming activity of mutant IDH is mediated by (R)-2HG and that (R)-2HG is necessary to maintain the transformed phenotype of tumor cells that harbor IDH mutations.  Go to: Mechanisms of transformation by (R)-2HG Several mechanisms of mutant IDH-mediated transformation have been proposed. One model for how mutant IDH contributes to tumorigenesis, and the one that has perhaps gained the most traction since the discovery of (R)-2HG, is transformation by 2OG antagonism. (R)-2HG is structurally and chemically very similar to 2OG (Fig. 2), and it has been proposed that (R)-2HG transforms cells by competitively inhibiting 2OG-dependent enzymes that function as tumor suppressors (Chowdhury et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012; Lu et al. 2012). There are ∼70 known and putative 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in the GenBank DNA database that could be relevant targets of (R)-2HG in mutant IDH-mediated transformation (Table 2).  Table 2. Table 2. List of known and putative 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in the in the GenBank DNA database TET2  The myeloid tumor suppressor TET2 is a particularly intriguing candidate to be a pathogenically relevant target of (R)-2HG in IDH mutant tumors. TET1, TET2, and TET3 are members of a family of 2OG-dependent DNA-modifying enzymes that hydroxylate 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to generate 5-hydroxymethycytosine (5hmC) (Tahiliani et al. 2009; Ito et al. 2010). The TET enzymes are also able to further oxidize 5hmC to generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) (He et al. 2011; Ito et al. 2011). Somatic mutations in TET2, including chromosomal microdeletions and missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, are common in clonal myeloid disorders, occurring in 10%–40% of cases of AML, MDS, MPN, and CMML (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2009; Delhommeau et al. 2009; Tefferi et al. 2009; Couronne et al. 2010; Chou et al. 2011). Interestingly, TET2 appears to be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Although a subset of cases of MDS and AML present with biallelic TET2 loss, the majority of cases present with heterozygous TET2 mutations (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2009; Bejar et al. 2011; Gaidzik et al. 2012). The other TET family members are not recurrently mutated in hematopoietic malignancies, although TET1 is an infrequent MLL fusion partner in rare cases of MLL translocation-positive AML (Lorsbach et al. 2003).  TET enzymes are thought to play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by mediating the demethylation of DNA. The conversion of 5mC to 5hmC and then to 5fC and 5caC by TET enzymes results in the generation of guanine:oxidized cytosine base-pair mismatches. It has been hypothesized that these mismatches are substrates for base excision repair by thymine–DNA glycosylase (TDG) (He et al. 2011; Raiber et al. 2012). It has also been suggested that 5caC residues are substrates for an as yet unidentified enzyme that can decarboxylate 5caC to generate unmethylated cytosine (Ito et al. 2011). In either case, oxidation of 5mC by TET enzymes, followed by TDG-mediated base excision or 5caC decarboxylation, would result in DNA demethylation. Indeed, overexpression of TET2 in HEK293 cells results in decreased 5mC levels and increased 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC levels, whereas knockdown of TET1 in mouse embryonic stem cells results in decreased 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC levels (Ito et al. 2011).  Given the putative role for TET2 in DNA demethylation, it would be expected that loss of TET2 activity should impair DNA demethylation and result in DNA hypermethylation. However, different studies have found inconsistent and even contradictory associations between TET2 mutational status and DNA methylation status in myeloid diseases. One study reported that TET2 mutant AML has a DNA hypermethylation signature (Figueroa et al. 2010). Two other studies found that genomic DNA is hypermethylated in TET2 wild-type myeloid diseases and is hypomethylated in TET2 mutant myeloid diseases (Ko et al. 2010; Perez et al. 2012). In yet another study, 5hmC levels were reported to be lower in TET2 mutant CMML than in TET2 wild-type disease, but global DNA methylation was the same in both cohorts (Yamazaki et al. 2012). In this last study, when locus-specific CpG island methylation was analyzed, only 11 of 27,578 CpG sites were differentially methylated between 5hmC-low and 5hmC-high patient samples. In the 5hmC-low patient samples, of the differentially methylated CpG sites, two were hypermethylated and the other nine were hypomethylated, suggesting that 5hmC levels do not correlate with 5mC levels at all. Some of these inconsistencies may be due to technical differences in experimental approach. It is also possible that TET2 mutations alter the methylation state of DNA at specific loci and only variably alter global DNA methylation.  Although 5mC and 5hmC are the only known substrates of TET2, TET2 may have other hydroxylation substrates besides DNA that mediate its tumor suppressor functions. Moreover, the hydroxylation of 5mC and the oxidation of 5hmC by TET2 might have other functions besides being intermediate steps in DNA demethylation. It has been observed that, in some cells, 5hmC modifications are copied to daughter strands during DNA replication (Szulwach et al. 2011). This requires a considerable expenditure of energy, as the daughter strands would first need to be methylated and then hydroxylated in order to maintain parental DNA 5hmC status. It seems unlikely that there would be significant selective pressure to maintain a nonfunctional transitional state of DNA demethylation. Rather, it seems more likely that 5hmC modifications and perhaps also 5fC and 5caC modifications play specific roles in the regulation of 5mC in the regulation of gene expression, perhaps by serving as recognition sites for the binding of distinct epigenetic and transcriptional regulators. Consistent with this hypothesis, specific “readers” of 5mC, 5hmC, and oxidized forms of 5hmC have recently been identified (Mellen et al. 2012; Spruijt et al. 2013). These include the transcriptional repressor MeCP2, which preferentially binds 5mC and 5hmC; the cell cycle regulator p53, which preferentially binds 5fC; and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, which preferentially binds 5caC. How the binding of these “readers” to modified cytosine residues contributes to the regulation of gene expression is not well understood, but it is likely that any perturbation of these interactions through imbalances in hydroxylation and oxidation of cytosine residues would have profound effects on cellular homeostasis.  There are several lines of evidence to suggest that TET2 is an important target of (R)-2HG in mutant IDH-mediated transformation. The catalytic activity of TET2 is potently inhibited by (R)-2HG in vitro (Xu et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012). Furthermore, IDH mutant brain tumors and leukemias frequently display global DNA hypermethylation signatures (Figueroa et al. 2010; Ko et al. 2010; Turcan et al. 2012). Perhaps the most persuasive evidence for a link between IDH and TET2 mutations is the observation that IDH mutations are mutually exclusive with TET2 mutations in AML (Figueroa et al. 2010; Gaidzik et al. 2012). This suggests that the two mutations act on the same leukemogenic pathways and have redundant effects on cellular transformation. Indeed, (R)-2HG enhances the transforming effects of partial inhibition of TET2. In TF-1 cells, depletion of TET2 induces growth factor independence and blocks cellular differentiation similarly to expression of mutant IDH, and this transformation by TET2 depletion is potentiated by cell-permeable (R)-2HG (Losman et al. 2013).  It is unclear whether TET2 and IDH are similarly linked in other tumors. Depletion of TET2 in immortalized human astrocytes phenocopies the transforming effects of mutant IDH expression, but TET2 mutations have not been described in brain tumors (Koivunen et al. 2012). Interestingly, TET2 promoter methylation is increased in some cases of IDH wild-type grade II/III glioma (Kim et al. 2011). Given that promoter methylation is frequently associated with transcriptional silencing, this suggests that TET2 expression and activity are lost in these IDH wild-type gliomas. Taken as a whole, these observations suggest that loss of TET2 activity by either a loss-of-function mutational event, epigenetic silencing, or inhibition of TET2 activity by (R)-2HG is a frequent and important pathogenic event in brain tumors and myeloid diseases.  The evidence that IDH and TET2 mutations function in the same oncogenic pathway notwithstanding, it is worth noting that the phenotype of the conditional TET2 knockout mouse is quite distinct from that of the IDH1 R132H knock-in mouse described above (Moran-Crusio et al. 2011; Sasaki et al. 2012b). Homozygous deletion of TET2 in the hematopoietic compartment of mice does not cause leukemia but does result in a more significant expansion of hematopoietic stem and early progenitor cells than is seen in IDH1 R132H knock-in mice. Furthermore, TET2-null hematopoietic stem cells have a marked competitive repopulating advantage in transplanted recipient mice when compared with TET2 wild-type stem cells. This increased repopulating activity is not seen with IDH1 R132H knock-in stem cells, suggesting that self-renewal is more markedly enhanced by loss of TET2 than by expression of mutant IDH. TET2-null mice also show granulocyte and monocyte precursor lineage expansion and a skewing of myeloid differentiation toward monocyte/macrophage lineages, phenotypes that are not observed in IDH1 R132H knock-in mice.  There appears to be a dose-dependent effect of loss of TET2 activity on murine hematopoiesis. Mice with heterozygous loss of TET2 show an intermediate hematologic phenotype, with a less dramatic increase in stem cell self-renewal and a less dramatic dysregulation of myeloid differentiation than is seen in the TET2-null mice. This observation raises an interesting point. If transformation by TET2 suppression is indeed gene dosage-dependent, then it is reasonable to assume that selective pressure exists for heterozygous TET2 mutant cells and IDH mutant cells to further inhibit TET2 activity. A heterozygous TET2 mutant clone could do this by mutating the remaining wild-type TET2 allele or acquiring an IDH mutation. An IDH mutant clone could do this by acquiring a TET2 mutation. Why, then, are IDH mutations and heterozygous TET2 mutations mutually exclusive? One possible explanation is that the clonal advantage conferred by loss of TET2 is less dose-dependent in human myeloid cells than it is in mice. A cell that has already partially inhibited TET2 activity by either losing one allele of TET2 or acquiring an IDH mutation might not benefit significantly from further TET2 inhibition. With this in mind, it is interesting to note that, although biallelic TET2 loss is relatively common in MDS, occurring in >25% of cases, complete loss of TET2 is not associated with a more aggressive clinical disease phenotype (Jankowska et al. 2009; Mohamedali et al. 2009; Bejar et al. 2011).  Another possible explanation for the mutual exclusivity of TET2 and IDH mutations in leukemia is that acquisition of an IDH mutation confers a clonal disadvantage to TET2 mutant cells. Cells expressing mutant IDH grow more slowly under optimal culture conditions than their parental counterparts (Seltzer et al. 2010; Bralten et al. 2011; Losman et al. 2013). This suggests that mutant IDH and (R)-2HG have growth-suppressive effects that coexist with their transforming, growth-promoting effects. Perhaps in cells that do not require mutant IDH for cell growth and survival (for example, cells in which TET2 is already mutated), the negative effects of (R)-2HG on proliferation overwhelm the positive effects of (R)-2HG on transformation. This explanation could also account for the less pronounced phenotype of the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice as compared with the TET2 conditional knockout mice. Perhaps the mild phenotype of the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice is not the result of inadequate inhibition of TET2 but rather is a reflection of the balance between the protransforming effects of (R)-2HG inhibition of TET2 and the anti-transforming effects of (R)-2HG inhibition of other, growth-promoting enzymes.  JmjC histone demethylases  The JmjC family of histone lysine demethylases is another family of enzymes that may be a pathogenically relevant target of (R)-2HG. Histone demethylases play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression (Klose et al. 2006; Shilatifard 2006). Histone methylation defines the structure of chromatin, and methylation of some histone residues (H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79) is often associated with transcriptionally active euchromatin, whereas other histone methylation marks (H3K9, H3K27, and H4K20) are usually associated with transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. The patterns of histone methylation at different genetic loci are a function of the balance between the activities of histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases, each of which binds and alters the methylation of specific histone lysine residues. Disruption of histone methylation or demethylation can have profound effects on gene expression, and JmjC histone demethylases have been linked to the pathogenesis of a number of different cancers (Cloos et al. 2008; Varier and Timmers 2011).  Several JmjC histone demethylases appear to function as tumor suppressors. The H3K36 JmjC demethylase KDM2B (JHDM1B/FBX10) is a transcriptional repressor that regulates ribosomal gene expression and represses c-Jun-mediated transcription (Frescas et al. 2007; Koyama-Nasu et al. 2007). Consistent with its putative role as a tumor suppressor, KDM2B expression is significantly lower in brain tumors than in normal brain tissue. The H3K9 JmjC demethylase KDM3B (JMJD1B) is frequently deleted in 5q− MDS and AML (Hu et al. 2001), and the H3K4 JmjC demethylase KDM5C (JARID1C) is occasionally mutated and inactivated in clear cell renal carcinoma (Dalgliesh et al. 2010; Hakimi et al. 2013). The H3K27 JmjC demethylase KDM6A (UTX) and its paralog, KDM6B (JMJD3), can also function as tumor suppressors. KDM6A cooperates with the Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein to enforce cell cycle blockade and also negatively regulates the activity of NOTCH (Herz et al. 2010; Terashima et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010). KDM6B is involved in the regulation of p53 and has been shown to promote the terminal differentiation of glioblastoma cells (Barradas et al. 2009; Sola et al. 2011).  It is possible that inhibition of tumor suppressor histone demethylases by (R)-2HG contributes to transformation by mutant IDH. In fact, (R)-2HG has been shown to inhibit the activity of many 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in vitro, including the JmjC histone demethylases KDM2A, KDM4A, KDM4C, and KDM7A (Chowdhury et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2012). Although the IC50 values for inhibition of 2OG-dependent enzymes by (R)-2HG vary considerably (ranging from 25 μM to >10 mM), it is important to remember that (R)-2HG can accumulate to millimolar levels in tumors. Moreover, overexpression of mutant IDH and treatment of cells with cell-permeable (R)-2HG has been reported to increase H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, and H3K79 histone methylation marks in cell culture models (Lu et al. 2012).  The biological significance of the histone methylation changes induced in vitro by (R)-2HG is not clear, and it is not yet known whether (R)-2HG affects histone methylation in primary human IDH mutant tumors. H3K9 trimethylation is frequently increased in IDH mutant gliomas (Vanneti et al. 2013). However, many IDH wild-type gliomas also display H3K9 hypermethylation, suggesting that aberrant histone methylation is a common finding in brain tumors irrespective of IDH mutational status. In the hematopoietic-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, bone marrow stem cells show a modest increase in methylated H3K4 levels but no change in other histone methylation marks (Sasaki et al. 2012b). Furthermore, no differences in global histone methylation are apparent in the brains of the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice (Sasaki et al. 2012a). Although this could be interpreted as evidence that (R)-2HG does not significantly affect histone methylation in vivo, it is also possible that (R)-2HG induces biologically important changes in histone methylation only at specific genetic loci that promote tumor formation. Histone methylation changes that are beneficial could be preferentially retained in mutant IDH-expressing cells, whereas deleterious changes could be reversed by compensatory changes such as down-regulation of specific histone methyltransferases.  As described above, several JmjC histone demethylases can function as tumor suppressors. However, some histone demethylases are also known to promote tumor growth. Moreover, there are multiple examples of chromatin-modifying enzymes—including histone demethylases and their opposing methyltransferases—that can act as either oncoproteins or tumor suppressors in different cellular contexts (Cloos et al. 2008). It is interesting to speculate that the different functions of the JmjC histone demethylases in different tissues could explain, at least in part, the tissue specificity of IDH mutations in cancer. If the proliferation and survival of a particular cell were dependent on the activity of JmjC histone demethylases that are potently inhibited by (R)-2HG, that cell would likely be relatively resistant to transformation by mutant IDH. Conversely, a cell in which those same JmjC histone demethylases are dispensable for proliferation or have tumor suppressor functions might be particularly vulnerable to transformation by mutant IDH.  EglN prolyl-4-hydroxylases  EglN1, EglN2, and EglN3 are members of a family of 2OG-dependent dioxygenases that regulate the activity of HIF, a heterodimeric transcription factor that mediates the cellular response to hypoxia (Kaelin and Ratcliffe 2008; Semenza 2012). In the presence of oxygen, EglN hydroxylates specific proline residues on HIFα, and these hydroxylated proline residues are then recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3–ubiquitin ligase complex. The VHL complex polyubiquitylates HIFα and targets it for proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, when intracellular levels of oxygen are low, the activity of EglN is inhibited. This permits accumulation of HIFα, which can then heterodimerize with HIFβ, translocate to the nucleus, and activate the transcriptional response of cells to hypoxia. EglN1 is believed to be the principal HIF prolyl-hydroxylase, with EglN2 and EglN3 playing variable compensatory roles in the regulation of HIF in different tissues under specific cellular conditions.  EglN enzymes were initially reported to be inhibited by (R)-2HG (Zhao et al. 2009). However, further study has shown that, on the contrary, (R)-2HG potentiates EglN activity in vitro and in vivo and blunts the induction of HIFα in response to hypoxia in cell culture models (Koivunen et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013). Consistent with this observation, IDH mutant brain tumors display decreased HIF activation compared with their wild-type counterparts (Williams et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012). It should be noted that HIFα levels are elevated in the brains of the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice (Sasaki et al. 2012a). However, these mice succumb at birth to cerebral hemorrhage, suggesting that their brain perfusion during development is abnormal. It is possible that tissue hypoxia, rather than a direct effect of (R)-2HG on EglN activity, is the cause of increased brain levels of HIFα in these mice.  Likewise, there is no evidence that HIF is activated in human IDH mutant leukemias. On the contrary, there is evidence to suggest that activation of HIF inhibits myeloid leukemia. A number of human myeloid leukemia cell lines have been reported to proliferate more slowly and undergo terminal differentiation and apoptosis upon exposure to hypoxia and upon overexpression of HIFα (Huang et al. 2003; di Giacomo et al. 2009; Zhang and Chen 2009; He et al. 2013), and inhibition of HIFα expression by RNAi blocks the differentiation of leukemia cells in response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (Zhang et al. 2008; Zhang and Chen 2009). Moreover, in a mouse model of acute promyelocytic leukemia, exposure of diseased mice to intermittent hypoxia induces leukemia cell differentiation and prolongs survival of the mice (Liu et al. 2006). These observations suggest that HIF may be a tumor suppressor in myeloid leukemia. However, it is not known whether the HIF response to hypoxia is truly blunted in IDH mutant tumors in vivo, as one would predict given that (R)-2HG can serve as an EglN agonist.  The ability of (R)-2HG to function as an EglN cosubstrate appears to play an important role in mutant IDH-mediated cellular transformation. In immortalized human astrocytes, either overexpression of EglN1 or depletion of HIF1α is sufficient to promote soft agar colony formation (Koivunen et al. 2012). Conversely, depletion of EglN1 in mutant IDH-transformed astrocytes inhibits the growth and soft agar colony formation of the cells. Intriguingly, (S)-2HG, which potently inhibits EglN in vitro, is unable to promote transformation of TF-1 leukemia cells. In fact, (S)-2HG antagonizes TF-1 cell transformation induced by TET2 loss (Losman et al. 2013). This is despite the fact that (S)-2HG is a more potent inhibitor of TET2 than is (R)-2HG (Xu et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012). Depletion of EglN1 in transformed TF-1 cells reverses transformation induced by expression of mutant IDH or by depletion of TET2, suggesting that the anti-leukemic properties of (S)-2HG relate to its ability to inhibit EglN1 (Losman et al. 2013). In short, inhibition of EglN1 by (S)-2HG reverses the leukemic transformation that would otherwise ensue as a result of its inhibition of TET2 activity.  Other candidate targets of (R)-2HG  A number of other 2OG-dependent enzymes might be inhibited by (R)-2HG in IDH mutant tumors (Table 2). Three types of collagen hydroxylases—the Leprecan family of prolyl-3-hydroxylases, the P4HA family of prolyl-4-hydroxylases, and the PLOD family of lysyl-5-hydroxylases—all require 2OG for activity, and P4HA1 has been found to be inhibited by (R)-2HG in vitro (Koivunen et al. 2012). The collagen prolyl-hydroxylases mediate the hydroxylation of proline residues required for formation of the collagen triple helix (Gorres and Raines 2010), and the collagen lysyl-hydroxylases mediate the hydroxylation of lysine residues required for collagen cross-linking into stable fibrils (Bank et al. 1999). Interestingly, collagen maturation has been found to be impaired in the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, suggesting that these enzymes are targets of inhibition by mutant IDH in vivo (Sasaki et al. 2012a). Although a role for these enzymes in cancer has not been established, the observation that expression of collagen prolyl-3-hydroxylases and prolyl-4-hydroxylases is down-regulated in many B-cell lymphomas suggests that these enzymes function as tumor suppressors in some tissues (Teodoro et al. 2006; Hatzimichael et al. 2012).  Other potential 2OG-dependent targets of (R)-2HG include FIH1 (factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1), an asparaginyl hydroxylase that regulates the transcriptional activity of HIF (Mahon et al. 2001); the ABH family of DNA demethylases that are involved in DNA damage repair (Lee et al. 2005); and the RNA demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated), which is believed to be important for the regulation of cellular metabolism (Jia et al. 2008; Berulava et al. 2013).  Go to: Other possible mechanisms of transformation by mutant IDH Another proposed mechanism of transformation by mutant IDH harkens back to Warburg's mitochondrial model of oncogenesis. Warburg (1956) hypothesized that the primary defect in cancer cells is impaired mitochondrial function, which causes cells to switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Warburg's model has been somewhat discredited by the observation that mitochondrial function is not impaired in most cancer cells (Wallace 2012). However, there are data to suggest that (R)-2HG directly interferes with normal mitochondrial function. Some D2HGA patients have elevated levels of urinary lactate, suggesting that they have some degree of mitochondrial dysfunction (Kranendijk et al. 2012). Furthermore, the activity of two enzyme complexes in the electron transport chain, complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and complex V (ATP synthase), can be inhibited by (R)-2HG in vitro (Kolker et al. 2002; Latini et al. 2005). Inhibition of ATP synthase expression and activity has been observed in some cancers and is believed to directly promote cellular transformation by causing the accumulation of excess electrons that are then transferred to molecular oxygen to generate superoxide (O2−) (Willers and Cuezva 2011).  Mutant IDH-expressing cells may have an impaired ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Latini et al. 2003). Conversion of 2OG to (R)-2HG by mutant IDH consumes NADPH, and the high catalytic rate of the mutant IDH reaction could conceivably result in depletion of cellular NADPH (Yan et al. 2009; Bleeker et al. 2010). NADPH is the electron donor used by glutathione reductase to regenerate reduced glutathione, which is the principal cellular and mitochondrial antioxidant that regulates cellular redox (Kirsch and De Groot 2001; Block and Gorin 2012). Depletion of NADPH might therefore decrease the ability of cells to neutralize DNA-damaging oxygen-free radicals. NADPH also has other regulatory functions in cells that could contribute to cellular transformation. NADPH plays a role in nutrient sensing and participates in the regulation of the cellular metabolic rate (Newsholme et al. 2010; Newsholme and Krause 2012), and NADPH is also involved in the regulation of thioredoxins, enzymes that regulate the thiol-disulphide redox state and activity of several transcription factors, including NF-κB and AP1 (Arner and Holmgren 2000; Kabe et al. 2005).  Although dysregulation of cellular redox has been shown to contribute to transformation in other types of cancer, it is not clear whether NADPH and ROS are in fact dysregulated in IDH mutant tumors. Consistent with the notion that mutant IDH can perturb cellular NADPH levels, the embryonic brains of the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice have a slight increase in their NADP+:NADPH ratio and slightly decreased levels of reduced glutathione (Sasaki et al. 2012a). However, the brains of the IDH1 R132H mice have lower, not higher, levels of ROS than control mice. In the hematopoietic-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, the NADP+:NADPH ratio and the levels of ROS are normal in the bone marrow (Sasaki et al. 2012b). Despite the apparent lack of increased ROS in the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, it is nonetheless possible that cellular redox dysregulation plays a role in transformation by mutant IDH. The mice may have subtle or compartmentalized, and yet pathophysiologically relevant, perturbations in their brain and bone marrow redox states that only become apparent under conditions of oxidative stress. It is also possible that otherwise normal cells have compensatory mechanisms that largely maintain redox homeostasis in the presence of mutant IDH and that these mechanisms are defective in cancer cells.  Another potential contributor to mutant IDH-mediated transformation is deficiency of wild-type IDH activity. Although most tumor-associated mutations in IDH result in (R)-2HG production, a few rare IDH1 and IDH2 mutants that do not produce (R)-2HG have recently been identified in lymphoid and thyroid tumors (Ward et al. 2012). These mutations are monoallelic and result in either decreased enzymatic activity or loss of expression of the mutant enzyme. It has not yet been determined whether these loss-of-function mutations contribute to cellular transformation or are simply passenger mutations, but they do raise the possibility that IDH haploinsufficiency in IDH mutant cells could be tumorigenic.  Go to: Therapeutic targeting of IDH mutant tumors The observation that (R)-2HG is sufficient to promote cellular transformation and that transformation by (R)-2HG is reversible suggests that inhibiting (R)-2HG production by mutant IDH would have efficacy in the treatment of IDH mutant cancers. In this regard, first-generation mutant IDH inhibitors capable of suppressing the production of (R)-2HG in vitro and in vivo have recently been reported (Popovici-Muller et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013; Rohle et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013).  As described above, EglN activation plays a causal role in the transformation of astrocytes by mutant IDH in cell culture models and appears to play a permissive role in the transformation of TF-1 leukemia cells by mutant IDH. These findings, if proven robust, warrant further exploration of the potential of EglN inhibitors for the treatment of IDH mutant neoplasms. A number of EglN inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of anemia and tissue ischemia, some of which have advanced to human clinical trials (Robinson et al. 2008; Miyata et al. 2011; Sen Banerjee et al. 2012; Forristal et al. 2013).  Finally, it seems likely that the millimolar levels of (R)-2HG that accumulate in IDH mutant tumors also create certain liabilities for tumor cells. For example, inhibition of certain enzymes by (R)-2HG, whether they are pathogenic targets or “bystanders,” might decrease cellular fitness and hence decrease the resistance of cells to certain forms of therapeutic attack. There is some indirect evidence to support this idea. For example, introduction of mutant IDH into TF-1 cells confers a growth disadvantage to the cells under cytokine-rich conditions even though mutant IDH confers a growth advantage to the cells under cytokine-poor conditions (Losman et al. 2013). Moreover, stable expression of IDH1 R132H impedes the growth and migration of human IDH1 wild-type GBM cell lines both in vitro and in mouse xenografts models (Bralten et al. 2011). The relatively good prognosis and enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation therapy of IDH mutant brain tumors might also reflect deleterious effects of (R)-2HG in tumor cells (Houillier et al. 2010; SongTao et al. 2012; Li et al. 2013). Therefore, another strategy for tackling IDH mutant tumors could be to systematically identify and target the unique dependencies that are created in the presence of millimolar concentrations of (R)-2HG, thereby converting the oncometabolite into an Achilles' heel.  Both genome-wide genetic and epigenetic alterations are fundamentally important for the development of cancers, but the interdependence of these aberrations is poorly understood. Glioblastomas and other cancers with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) constitute a subset of tumours with extensive epigenomic aberrations and a distinct biology1–3. Glioma CIMP (G-CIMP) is a powerful determinant of tumour pathogenicity, but the molecular basis of G-CIMP remains unresolved. Here we show that mutation of a single gene, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), establishes G-CIMP by remodelling the methylome. This remodelling results in reorganization of the methylome and transcriptome. Examination of the epigenome of a large set of intermediate-grade gliomas demonstrates a distinct G-CIMP phenotype that is highly dependent on the presence of IDH mutation. Introduction of mutant IDH1 into primary human astrocytes alters specific histone marks, induces extensive DNA hypermethylation, and reshapes the methylome in a fashion that mirrors the changes observed in G-CIMP-positive lower-grade gliomas. Furthermore, the epigenomic alterations resulting from mutant IDH1 activate key gene expression programs, characterize G-CIMP-positive proneural glioblastomas but not other glioblastomas, and are predictive of improved survival. Our findings demonstrate that IDH mutation is the molecular basis of CIMP in gliomas, provide a framework for understanding oncogenesis in these gliomas, and highlight the interplay between genomic and epigenomic changes in human cancers.  The isocitrate dehydrogenase genes IDH1 and IDH2 are mutated in >70%of lower-grade gliomas (grades II and III), in some glioblastomas4,5, and in leukaemias and several other cancers6,7. The most common IDH1 mutations in glioma (>95%) result in an amino acid substitution at arginine 132 (R132), which resides in the enzyme’s active site. Mutation of IDH imparts the ability to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), a potential oncometabolite8–10. Alterations in the methylation landscape have been shown to have important roles during oncogenesis11. CIMP has emerged as a distinct molecular subclass of tumours in a number of human malignancies, including glioblastoma1–3. This phenotype is associated with extensive, coordinated hypermethylation at specific loci1,2,12,13. In glioblastomas, G-CIMP is associated with the proneural subgroup of tumours and IDH mutation1. Exactly how mutant IDH promotes tumorigenesis and causes G-CIMP—or CIMP in any type of human cancer—is unknown.  To determine whether IDH1 mutation directly causes G-CIMP, we used immortalized primary human astrocytes14 and constructed isogenic cells expressing either mutant IDH1 (R132H), wild-type IDH1, or neither. These astrocytes are well characterized14–17. Introduction of wild-type IDH1 and the R132H IDH1 mutant resulted in equal expression of protein (modest threefold increase) (Fig. 1a). Expression of mutant but not wild-type IDH1 in human astrocytes resulted in the production of 2-HG (Fig. 1b). To determine whether mutant IDH1 altered the methylation landscape, we analysed genomic DNA from these cells using the Illumina InfiniumHumanMethylation450 platform. The platform provides genome-wide coverage and is both well validated and highly reproducible18,19.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Introduction of mutant IDH1 into human astrocytes remodels the methylome Previous data demonstrated that de novo DNA methylation in in vitro models occurs over extended periods, requiring time to ‘lock in’ epigenomic changes12,20. We thus analysed the methylomes of astrocytes expressing mutant or wild-type IDH1 over successive passages (up to 50). Analysis using self-organizing maps demonstrated that mutant IDH1 progressively remodelled the glial methylome over time (Fig. 1c, d), an effect that was not seen in control astrocytes. Expression of mutant IDH1 caused a marked increase in hypermethylation at a large number of genes, although there was a small group of hypomethylated genes as well (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Surprisingly, expression of wild-type IDH1 also reshaped the methylome but in a manner that differed from effects due to expression of mutant IDH1 (Fig. 1f). Expression of wild-type IDH1 caused hypomethylation at specific loci, suggesting that both the production of 2-HG and the levels of α-ketoglutarate can affect the methylome. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the methylome data showed that the hypermethylated genes included both genes that underwent de novo methylation as well as genes that originally possessed low levels of methylation but subsequently acquired high levels of methylation (Fig. 1e). Control astrocytes did not undergo these methylome changes (Fig. 1c, d). Mutant IDH1-induced remodelling of the methylome was progressive and reproducible, and resulted in significant changes in gene expression (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 1a, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).  We sought to define the methylation targets of mutant IDH in astrocytes. Of the 44,334 CpG sites that were differentially methylated in mutant IDH-expressing cells, 30,988 sites were hypermethylated (3,141 unique genes with promoter CpG island methylation changes; Supplementary Table 1). Transcriptional module mapping showed that the genes undergoing methylation changes were highly enriched for polycomb complex 2 (PRC2)-targeted loci (Supplementary Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 4)12,21. These observations demonstrate that mutant IDH1 is sufficient to reshape the epigenome by altering the global methylation landscape.  Lower-grade gliomas (LGGs; World Health Organization grades II and III) and secondary glioblastomas are biologically distinct from primary or de novo glioblastomas22. Present knowledge of G-CIMP is based on the examination of primary glioblastomas in which IDH mutations are infrequent1,4,5. To determine the impact of IDH mutation on the methylation landscape in primary LGGs, we generated a high-resolution, genome-wide set of LGG methylome data from patients with complete clinical follow-up using the same Infinium 450K platform as described earlier (72 WHO grade II and III gliomas; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 5). We first performed consensus clustering (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a) and unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2b) to identify LGG subgroups. We identified two robust DNA methylation clusters, one encompassing tumours with markedly high methylation levels (cluster 2) and another without the hypermethylated loci (cluster 1). Cluster 2 tumours demonstrated a characteristic DNA methylation profile with high-coordinate cancer-specific methylation at a subset of loci, concordant with the G-CIMP phenotype defined in glioblastomas (Supplementary Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 6)1. The composition of the G-CIMP group in these LGGs was confirmed by two independent clustering methods (K-means consensus and two-dimensional hierarchical clustering) (Fig. 2a, b). Probes defining CIMP in LGGs included those in CpG islands and shores (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d) and were enriched for PRC2-target genes (Supplementary Table 7). Global expression profiles showed that G-CIMP+ tumours possessed markedly different transcriptional profiles than G-CIMP− tumours (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). EpiTYPER (Sequenom) mass spectrometry was used to validate the methylation status of loci in both the astrocyte model and in the tumours (Supplementary Fig. 2e–g)23.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Global epigenetic analysis of LGGs reveals dependence of G-CIMP on IDH mutation To determine the mutational status of IDH1and IDH2, we sequenced the entire coding sequence of the two genes in all the samples above (Fig. 2b). Ninety-eight per cent (49/50) of the G-CIMP+ tumours possessed either an IDH1 mutation or IDH2 mutation. Notably, none of the G-CIMP− tumours possessed mutant IDH (Supplementary Fig. 2h). These genomic data show that G-CIMP is highly dependent on the presence of IDH mutation and, in LGGs that are CIMP−, IDH mutations do not occur (0%). Currently, the methylation status of O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a widely used molecular biomarker for glioblastoma prognosis and response to temozolomide24. In LGGs, G-CIMP associated with markedly better clinical endpoints (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Figs 3– 6, Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). Importantly, G-CIMP was significantly superior to MGMT methylation or MGMT messenger RNA expression as a predictor of survival (Fig. 2d).  We next sought to define the nature of the methylome differences between IDH mutant and wild-type tumours and characterize the effects of these differences on the LGG transcriptome. Figure 3a shows a principal component analysis (PCA) of methylome and expression data from our tumours. PCA shows that G-CIMP+ and G-CIMP− LGGs methylome subgroups correlate with marked transcriptome differences (Fig. 3a). Of the 140,016 sites that were differentially methylated between IDH mutant and wild-type tumours, 121,660 were hypermethylated (Supplementary Table 6). There were 2,611 unique genes with alterations in promoter CpG islands represented in this group. Consistent with the results in Fig. 2b, a volcano plot showing differentially methylated genes between G-CIMP+ and G-CIMP− tumours was highly asymmetric (Fig. 3b). A starburst plot showing the relationship between DNA methylation and expression is shown in Fig. 3b. Integration of the normalized gene expression and DNA methylation gene sets identified 429 genes with both significant hypermethylation and downregulation and 176 genes that were hypomethylated and upregulated in G-CIMP+ LGGs (Supplementary Table 12). Among these genes are those known to be involved in glioma initiation and outcome, including CDKN2C and GAP43 (refs 25, 26).  Figure 3 Figure 3 IDH1 mutation directly generates the methylation patterns present in G-CIMP tumours As a critical experiment to prove causality between IDH1 mutation and G-CIMP, we performed an in-depth comparison of methylation marks and gene expression alterations between human astrocytes expressing mutant IDH1 and the LGGs with endogenous IDH1 mutation. We first focused on the comparison of methylation marks and found that both sets of methylome alterations targeted similar loci. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the mutant IDH1-induced methylation changes in the isogenic astrocyte system (Fig. 1) and the G-CIMP genes demonstrated very significant enrichment and concordance (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 13 and Supplementary Fig. 7). Importantly, the genes that were methylated after mutant IDH1 expression correctly classified LGG tumours into CIMP+ or CIMP− groups with very high accuracy (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 14). To confirm the impact of these alterations on glioma pathobiology, we used the transcriptomic footprint of mutant IDH to generate an expression signature (mutant IDH repression signature) composed of the most significantly methylated and downregulated genes in both the isogenic astrocyte system and the G-CIMP gene set (17 genes; Supplementary Table 15). As expected, this signature classified an independent LGG cohort (Rembrandt) into two distinct subgroups (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Figs 8–10 and Supplementary Table 16). Together, our findings show that introduction of mutant IDH reprograms the epigenome and generates the foundations of G-CIMP.  IDH mutation is highly enriched in the CIMP+, proneural subgroup of glioblastomas. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we applied the mutant IDH repression signature as a classifier to the transcriptomes of all four subgroups of glioblastomas27. The signature segregated IDH mutant and wild-type proneural glioblastomas into two distinct subgroups associated with very different prognoses, but did not do so in other glioblastoma subgroups (Supplementary Fig. 11a, b). These data demonstrate that mutant IDH-induced epigenomic alterations have profound biological implications within the proneural class of glioblastomas that are specific for this subclass. Comparison of gene expression programs that occur in astrocytes expressing mutant IDH1 to those in LGG tumours that harbour the IDH mutation showed remarkable similarity (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 12). Moreover, introduction of mutant but not wild-type IDH1 into astrocytes resulted in the upregulation of nestin (and other genes associated with stem cell identity) at the time of DNA methylation increase and the adoption of a neurosphere/stem-like phenotype (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 13)28. These data suggest that mutant IDH1 functions by interfering with differentiation state.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Functional implications of IDH1-mutation-induced alterations in the glioma epigenome Our data show that IDH1 mutation is the mechanistic cause of G-CIMP. To gain further insight, we determined the effects of mutant IDH1 on histone alterations in our astrocyte system. Figure 4c (left) shows that expression of the IDH1 mutant increases levels of H3K9me2, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3, consistent with previous findings29. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments examining representative genes that undergo hypermethylation show H3K9 and H3K27 methylation are both enriched in cells expressing mutant IDH1 (Fig. 4c, right). As both of these marks can promote DNA methylation, alterations in histone marks may contribute to the accumulation of DNA methylation.  Next, we determined the effects the mutation had onTET2-dependent 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels. We used a well-established assay9,29 and first confirmed that we were able to detect TET-dependent alterations in 5hmC (Supplementary Fig. 14). We found that expression of the IDH1 mutant in astrocytes resulted in a significant decrease in 5hmC (Fig. 4d, right). Expression of TET2 in the astrocytes produced 5hmC, which was inhibited by mutant but not wild-type IDH1 (Fig. 4d, left). Because TET-mediated production of 5hmC is a primary mode of DNA demethylation30, inhibition of this activity in the IDH1-mutant-expressing astrocytes may be a mechanistic basis for accumulation of DNA methylation, ultimately leading to a CIMP pattern.  IDH mutation and the CIMP phenotype are two very common features in cancer, the underlying mechanisms for which are obscure. The fundamental questions regarding these features are (1) how the IDH mutation contributes to oncogenesis, and (2) what the root cause of CIMP is. Our data address these important questions by demonstrating that IDH mutation is the cause of CIMP and leads to the CIMP phenotype by stably reshaping the epigenome. This remodelling involves modulating patterns of methylation on a genome-wide scale, changing transcriptional programs and altering the differentiation state. Our observations suggest that the activity of IDH may form the basis of an ‘epigenomic rheostat’, linking alterations in cellular metabolism to the epigenetic state. In summary, these data provide a mechanistic framework for how IDH mutation leads to oncogenesis and the molecular basis of CIMP in gliomas. We believe our observations have critical implications for the understanding of gliomas and the development of novel therapies for this disease.  Monoallelic point mutations of the NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2 occur frequently in gliomas, acute myeloid leukemias, and chondromas, and display robust association with specific DNA hypermethylation signatures. Here we show that heterozygous expression of the IDH1R132H allele is sufficient to induce the genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation characteristic of these tumors. Using a gene-targeting approach, we knocked-in a single copy of the most frequently observed IDH1 mutation, R132H, into a human cancer cell line and profiled changes in DNA methylation at over 27,000 CpG dinucleotides relative to wild-type parental cells. We find that IDH1R132H/WT mutation induces widespread alterations in DNA methylation, including hypermethylation of 2010 and hypomethylation of 842 CpG loci. We demonstrate that many of these alterations are consistent with those observed in IDH1-mutant and G-CIMP+ primary gliomas and can segregate IDH wild-type and mutated tumors as well as those exhibiting the G-CIMP phenotype in unsupervised analysis of two primary glioma cohorts. Further, we show that the direction of IDH1R132H/WT-mediated DNA methylation change is largely dependent upon preexisting DNA methylation levels, resulting in depletion of moderately methylated loci. Additionally, whereas the levels of multiple histone H3 and H4 methylation modifications were globally increased, consistent with broad inhibition of histone demethylation, hypermethylation at H3K9 in particular accompanied locus-specific DNA hypermethylation at several genes down-regulated in IDH1R132H/WT knock-in cells. These data provide insight on epigenetic alterations induced by IDH1 mutations and support a causal role for IDH1R132H/WT mutants in driving epigenetic instability in human cancer cells.  Mutations of the NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes IDH1 and IDH2 occur in >70% of Grade II–III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas (sGBM) (Balss et al. 2008; Parsons et al. 2008; Bleeker et al. 2009; Hartmann et al. 2009; Yan et al. 2009a,b; Gravendeel et al 2010), 15%–30% of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) (Mardis et al. 2009; Marcucci et al. 2010; Paschka et al. 2010; Wagner et al. 2010; Ward et al. 2010), 56% of chondrosarcomas (Amary et al. 2011), 87% of enchondromas, 70% of spindle cell hemangiomas (Pansuriya et al. 2011), 22%–28% of cholangiocarcinomas of intrahepatic origin (Borger et al. 2012; Kipp et al. 2012), and at lower frequencies in other malignancies, including colorectal cancer (Sjoblom et al. 2006), prostate carcinoma, and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (Kang et al. 2009). IDH mutations occur early in tumor development and may either cause or predispose cells to become malignant (Ichimura et al. 2009; Watanabe et al. 2009). In human tumors, IDH mutations give rise to single amino acid substitutions at specific conserved residues, arginine 132 (R132) of IDH1 and arginine 140 (R140) or arginine 172 (R172) of IDH2. These IDH point mutations primarily occur as somatically acquired heterozygous events, with tumor cells showing one mutant allele and retention of the second wild-type allele, suggesting that the ratio of mutant to wild-type enzyme may be critical to its oncogenic activity. The IDH mutation leads to an attenuation of the normal catalytic activity, the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) (Yan et al. 2009b; Zhao et al. 2009), while concurrently imparting a gain of novel enzymatic function wherein α-KG is reduced, leading to the aberrant accumulation of the onco-metabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) (Dang et al. 2009). Both reduction of cellular α-KG levels and accumulation of D-2-HG have the potential to contribute to altered cellular phenotypes through the inhibition of multiple Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (W Xu et al. 2011), a superfamily of enzymes involved in a wide range of biological functions, including DNA repair and chromatin modification, such as the AlkB family of oxidative demethylases, the Jumonji-C domain family of histone demethylases (JHDMs), and the TET family of methylcytosine hydroxylases (Loenarz and Schofield 2008; Tahiliani et al. 2009; Figueroa et al. 2010a; Chowdhury et al. 2011).  Recent large-scale studies of DNA methylation distribution in primary tumors have identified biologically distinct subgroups of glioblastomas (GBMs) and AMLs associated with aberrant DNA methylation (Figueroa et al. 2010b; Noushmehr et al. 2010). A subset of primary GBMs exhibit the “CpG island methylator phenotype” (CIMP) and show concordant hypermethylation of a large number of CpG islands (Toyota and Issa 1999; Toyota et al. 1999; Noushmehr et al. 2010). Interestingly, in gliomas, the CIMP phenotype (termed G-CIMP) has a striking association with IDH1 mutation (Noushmehr et al. 2010; Christensen et al. 2011; Laffaire et al. 2011; Turcan et al. 2012). Similarly, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations robustly associate with specific global DNA hypermethylation phenotypes in AMLs (Figueroa et al. 2010a), enchondromas (Pansuriya et al. 2011), and low-grade gliomas (LGGs) (Turcan et al. 2012). The evidence linking IDH1 and IDH2 mutations with distinct DNA methylation phenotypes in primary human tumors raises the question of whether these mutations can drive oncogenesis through epigenetic reprogramming of cancer cells. Such epigenetic changes, including DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation, can play fundamental roles in the initiation and progression of human cancer through regulation of gene expression (Jones and Baylin 2002, 2007). In addition to epigenetic classifications, gene expression-based molecular classification systems have been developed in GBM to distinguish clinically relevant molecular subclasses (Phillips et al. 2006; Li et al. 2009; Verhaak et al. 2010). GBMs with IDH1 mutations were shown to primarily exhibit a proneural gene expression signature (Verhaak et al. 2010), although specific gene-expression alterations resulting from mutant IDH1 proteins have not been elucidated.  Despite the apparent correlation between IDH mutations and CpG island hypermethylation, the contribution of heterozygous expression of IDH1 point mutations to this phenotype has not been addressed. One limitation of the field has been the lack of model systems that recapitulate naturally occurring monoallelic point mutations observed in human tumors. Previous studies have relied on ectopic overexpression in human and mouse cell lines to study the effects of mutant IDH proteins (Dang et al. 2009; Yan et al. 2009b; Figueroa et al. 2010a; Ward et al. 2010; G Jin et al. 2011; Reitman et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2012; Turcan et al. 2012). To address this issue, and to faithfully recapitulate the naturally occurring genetic alterations, we utilized gene targeting to introduce heterozygous IDH1R132H/WT substitutions in the human colorectal cancer cell line, HCT116. We determined the impact of this mutation on the genome-wide distribution of CpG methylation in the isogenic IDH1R132H/WT cells and identified differentially methylated CpGs induced by the IDH1R132H/WT mutation, which include both hyper- and hypomethylation events. Our data indicate that IDH1R132H/WT mutations play a causal role in the widespread alteration of DNA and histone methylation observed in human cancers and can impact gene expression.  Go to: Results Targeted knock-in of IDH1R132H/WT hotspot mutation in a human cancer cell line  To analyze the epigenetic effects of heterozygous IDH1R132H/WT point mutations, we established isogenic cell lines in which one wild-type allele of this gene was replaced with the IDH1R132H allele. HCT116 was selected for IDH1R132H/WT knock-in because the cell line is diploid at the IDH1 locus and is susceptible to gene targeting through homologous recombination (Shirasawa et al. 1993; Waldman et al. 1995). Additionally, HCT116 cells have the intact machinery to exhibit physiologically relevant methylation patterns and have been utilized to examine DNA methylation phenotypes resulting from genetic ablation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) (Rhee et al. 2000, 2002). We utilized gene targeting by homologous recombination with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) constructs (Kohli et al. 2004; Topaloglu et al. 2005; Rago et al. 2007) to replace one IDH1 allele with an IDH1R132H allele in the HCT116 cell line (Fig. 1A). Clones that underwent homologous recombination at the IDH1 locus were verified using a PCR-based approach (Supplemental Fig. 1A). Cre-mediated excision of the selection cassette was confirmed by both PCR-based and functional assays (Supplemental Fig. 1B). Two independent clones were obtained for further detailed analysis, IDH1R132H/WT knock-in 1 (KI-1) and IDH1R132H/WT knock-in 2 (KI-2). Resulting clones were sequenced to confirm the presence of the heterozygous G>A IDH1 mutation (Fig. 1B). We also sequenced the cDNA from each knock-in clone to confirm equal expression of the wild-type (R132) and mutant (H132) alleles (Fig. 1B). Quantification of intracellular D-2-HG showed that the levels of D-2-HG were more than 100-fold higher in clarified cell lysates from the knock-in clones KI-1 (P = 0.023) and KI-2 (P = 0.020) as compared with parental cells, confirming neomorphic IDH1R132H enzymatic activity (Fig. 1C). Additionally, IDH1R132H/WT knock-in cells readily excrete D-2-HG to their surrounding environment, as concentrations of D-2-HG in the cell culture media from both KI-1 (P < 0.01) and KI-2 (P < 0.01) were more than 100-fold higher than that in culture media from parental cells (Fig. 1D).  Figure 1. Figure 1. Targeted knock-in of IDH1R132H/WT hotspot mutation in a human cancer cell line. (A) To faithfully recapitulate expression of heterozygous IDH1R132H/WT mutations as observed in human tumors, a targeting vector was designed to introduce the IDH1R132H mutation ... IDH1R132H/WT induces alterations in DNA methylation  We next examined the effects of IDH1R132H/WT on DNA methylation patterns using Infinium Methylation27 profiling (Illumina, Inc.). This platform uses a single nucleotide extension approach on bisulfite modified DNA to interrogate the methylation status of 27,578 CpG sites spanning 14,475 genes. The relative methylation levels are returned as a “β-value” (0 to 1) calculated from the ratio of signal intensity from the methylated probe to the total signal from both unmethylated and methylated probes for each CpG site, approximating the percent methylation. Two replicate samples of two clonal variants derived from each of the two independent knock-in clones, KI-1 and KI-2, were analyzed as compared with four wild-type IDH1 parental cell line replicates. Comparison of the relative methylation (β) distribution of all assayed CpG sites in KI-1, KI-2, and parental cells revealed a significant shift in the relative DNA methylation (β) density distribution upon IDH1R132H/WT knock-in (Fig. 2A). Most notably, IDH1R132H/WT knock-in cells showed an increased frequency of CpG sites with high levels of methylation (β ∼0.8–1.0). Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the wild-type and IDH1R132H/WT knock-in cells separate by genotype based on their overall methylation patterns (Supplemental Fig. 2A). Differential methylation analyses were performed comparing each of the two independent knock-in clones with the wild-type parental cells. These analyses yielded concordant results wherein the majority of differentially methylated loci associated with IDH1R132H/WT in either clone was common to the other, demonstrating a largely similar effect on methylation resulting from two independent recombination events (Supplemental Fig. 2B,C). We combined the data from all replicates of both knock-in clones and wild-type parental cells in a cumulative analysis and identified 2852 loci that were significantly differentially methylated between knock-in and wild-type cells (Fig. 2B). Of these, 2010 and 842 loci were significantly hyper- or hypomethylated, respectively, in the knock-in clones relative to wild-type cells (FDR < 0.01; Supplemental Fig. 2D; Supplemental Table 1). Gene ontology analysis of unique genes represented by the 2010 hypermethylated CpG sites showed enrichment of functional categories surrounding intracellular signaling and response to extracellular stimuli (Supplemental Table 2). Similar ontologies were also found to be significantly enriched among CpG loci previously published as hypermethylated in G-CIMP positive (G-CIMP+) GBMs (Noushmehr et al. 2010) and LGGs (Turcan et al. 2012). Conversely, hypomethylated loci showed over-representation of nucleotide metabolism and differentiation (Supplemental Table 3). Interestingly, an examination of the relative methylation distribution of the 2010 hypermethylated and 842 hypomethylated loci showed a depletion of moderately methylated loci (i.e., probes with β ∼0.2–0.7 in wild-type cells) and a corresponding shift toward greater or lesser methylation levels in the knock-in cells (Fig. 2C). Indeed, loci that became hypermethylated in the IDH1R132H/WT knock-ins generally arose from those CpG sites harboring a considerable degree of preexisting methylation in the wild-type parental cells. These hypermethylated loci had, on average, a greater starting methylation level in the parental HCT116 cells than those that became hypomethylated, which tended to arise from CpG sites with lower starting methylation levels (Fig. 2D). Together, these data support that endogenous heterozygous expression of the IDH1R132H/WT mutation systematically impacts global DNA methylation levels and, furthermore, that the direction of change is dependent upon the initial methylation levels in the parental cells.  Figure 2. Figure 2. IDH1R132H/WT-induced DNA methylation alterations in HCT116 cells. HCT116-IDH1R132H/WT knock-in clones and parental cells were analyzed using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 assay. (A) Relative DNA methylation (β) distribution for IDH1WT HCT116 ... Methylation alterations observed in HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in cell lines are similarly affected in a brain tumor cell line overexpressing IDH1R132H  To determine the general applicability of the above results, we also assayed genome-wide DNA methylation in a human oligodendroglioma (HOG) cell line stably overexpressing IDH1R132H (Reitman et al. 2011). Comparison of the relative methylation (β) distribution of all assayed CpG sites revealed a shift in DNA methylation upon IDH1R132H expression, as compared with HOG cells expressing empty vector, resembling the shift in overall methylation observed in the HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT cells and resulting in increased frequency of CpG sites with high levels of methylation (β ∼0.8–1.0) (Supplemental Fig. 3A). To determine whether the expression of IDH1R132H in HOG cells had a similar effect on DNA methylation at specific loci, we examined the influence of IDH1R132H overexpression on methylation at loci shown to be differentially methylated in the HCT116 knock-in cells. There was a largely concordant influence of IDH mutation on the behavior of the individual CpG loci in both models (Supplemental Fig. 3B). Considering the different cell backgrounds, it was not surprising that loci that undergo hypermethylation in HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in clones, which started with relatively high methylation levels in parental HCT116 cells, showed a broader methylation distribution in HOG cells, as did the loci that became hypomethylated in HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in clones (cf. Fig. 2C and Supplemental Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, there was a similar influence of the IDH1 mutation on methylation distribution in both sets, in that there was a general depletion of sites with intermediate methylation levels (β ∼0.3–0.7) and an accumulation of sites with methylation levels at the extremes (β > 0.8 or <0.2; Supplemental Fig. 3C). Moreover, loci that were significantly hypermethylated in HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT cells showed an overall increase in methylation in the HOG cells overexpressing the IDH1R132H mutant (P ≤ 0.0098), and loci that were significantly hypomethylated in the HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT cells showed an overall decrease in methylation levels in the HOG cell line expressing the IDH1R132H mutant (P ≤ 0.084; Supplemental Fig. 3D). Like the HCT116 cell line, those loci that became hypermethylated in the IDH1R132H-expressing HOG cells had a higher initial DNA methylation level in HOG parental cells than those that became hypomethylated (Supplemental Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data suggest that loci differentially methylated in the HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in model are similarly affected by overexpression of mutant IDH1 in oligodendroglioma cells.  Methylation alterations observed in HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in cell lines are similarly associated with IDH1 mutation in IDH1-mutant and G-CIMP+ primary gliomas  Previously, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium identified a subset of GBMs exhibiting a high degree of concordant hypermethylation events, dubbed the glioma-specific “CpG island methylator phenotype” (G-CIMP), and further showed that this phenotype was significantly associated with IDH1 mutation in primary tumors (Noushmehr et al. 2010). A more recent study also characterized a cohort of primarily G-CIMP+ LGGs using DNA methylation and expression platforms (Turcan et al. 2012). We selected 61 primary GBMs characterized as part of the TCGA project for which definitive IDH1 mutational status and Illumina HumanMethylation27 data were available (Noushmehr et al. 2010), as well as 81 LGGs for which G-CIMP status and Illumina HumanMethylation450 data were available (Turcan et al. 2012) for further analysis. Although the overall relative methylation (β) distribution for the two cohorts differed somewhat due to the use of the two different DNA methylation platforms, there was an overall shift toward higher methylation levels in tumors with IDH1 mutations and/or G-CIMP+ classification, particularly in the frequency of CpG sites with a high level of methylation (β > 0.7) and a reduced frequency of loci with low levels of methylation (β < 0.2) (Fig. 3A,B).  Figure 3. Figure 3. IDH1 mutant and G-CIMP+ gliomas recapitulate the DNA methylation alterations observed in cell line models. (A) Relative DNA methylation (β) distribution for 61 TCGA GBMs with definitive IDH1 mutational status and HumanMethylation27 data available ... To determine whether the alterations in DNA methylation induced by IDH1R132H/WT are reflective of IDH1 mutation-associated methylation changes observed in primary tumors, we performed hierarchical clustering on the 61 TCGA GBMs and the 81 LGGs using the subset of CpG sites altered in the HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT model (Supplemental Table 1). We found that the methylation status of the HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT differentially methylated loci segregated wild-type from IDH1-mutated GBMs (Fig. 3C) as well as G-CIMP+ from G-CIMP negative (G-CIMP−) LGGs (Fig. 3D). Permutation analyses confirmed that the segregation achieved for the 2852 HCT116 differential CpG loci was significantly greater than that achieved using the same number of randomly selected probes (P < 0.001). Although HCT116 cells have different underlying methylation patterns than those of the brain, the loci hypermethylated in HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT cells show the same trend toward hypermethylation in the IDH1-mutant and G-CIMP+ gliomas relative to IDH1 wild-type or G-CIMP− tumors (P ≤ 0.018) (Fig. 3E,F; Supplemental Fig. 4A,C). A further comparison of the genes hypermethylated in HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in cells with those reported to be hypermethylated in the G-CIMP+ versus G-CIMP−proneural GBMs (Noushmehr et al. 2010), and those reported to be differentially methylated in G-CIMP+ versus G-CIMP− LGGs (Turcan et al. 2012), revealed a significant overlap (Supplemental Fig. 4B,D; P ≤ 1.8 × 10−22, Fisher's exact). Approximately 17% of the sites that became hypermethylated in HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT were also hypermethylated in IDH1 mutated GBMs and >40% were also hypermethylated in G-CIMP+ LGGs. Interestingly, analysis of data from primary human astrocytes overexpressing IDH1R132H (Turcan et al. 2012) showed that there was not only a similar frequency of IDH mutation-induced differential methylation events, and fraction of hyper- versus hypomethylation, as detected in the HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in lines (in both cases 9% of CpG sites interrogated were differentially methylated overall, 70% of which were hypermethylated), but also a similar degree of concordance between hypermethylation induced in these two models and that associated with the G-CIMP+ phenotype in primary LGGs (e.g., 40% of HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT versus 36% of IDH1R132H astrocyte hypermethylated sites were concordantly hypermethylated in G-CIMP+ LGGs; P ≤ 7.9 × 10−41, Fisher's exact; Supplemental Fig. 4D). Together, these analyses show that loci hypermethylated in HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in lines are also subject to hypermethylation in IDH1-mutant or G-CIMP+ primary gliomas, and further, that the impact of IDH1 mutation on the methylome is similar regardless of the cell type of origin or starting methylation level. However, unlike the cell culture models, the HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT hypomethylated loci did not show evidence of reduced methylation in mutant versus wild-type IDH1 GBMs or G-CIMP+ versus G-CIMP− LGGs (Fig. 3E,F; Supplemental Fig. 4A,C). Nevertheless, CpG sites that became hypomethylated in response to IDH1R132H/WT in HCT116 cells generally exhibited lower methylation levels in the gliomas than those prone to hypermethylation (Fig. 3E,F). An examination of the loci identified by Turcan et al. (2012) as differentially methylated in G-CIMP+ versus G-CIMP− LGGs revealed a similar relationship to methylation level in that the hypomethylated loci tended to exhibit a lower average β across all tumors (mean β = 0.32) than those that showed G-CIMP-associated hypermethylation (Supplemental Fig. 4E,F). Thus, the same relative depletion of moderately methylated loci observed in the HCT116 knock-in model was also observed in G-CIMP+ and IDH-mutant primary gliomas.  Effects of IDH1R132H/WT on gene expression  In addition to IDH1-mutant GBMs being classified almost exclusively as G-CIMP positive, they also robustly associate with distinct gene-expression signatures, in particular, the proneural GBM subclassification (Verhaak et al. 2010). We took advantage of our isogenic system and sought to examine the contribution of a 1-bp allelic substitution at IDH1 on gene-expression patterns. Genome-wide expression data were generated for the HCT116 parent and IDH1R132H/WT knock-in clones using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Arrays. Analysis of parental versus KI-1 and KI-2 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in clones yielded 21 differentially expressed probes from 19 unique genes, 18 of which were down-regulated in the IDH1R132H/WT clones (FDR < 0.05; fold-change > 1.5) (Fig. 4A; Supplemental Table 4). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified gene sets involved in protein degradation and Wnt signaling as enriched among the genes down-regulated in IDH1R132H/WT cells (Supplemental Table 5). Interestingly, 6 of 18 and 7 of 18 down-regulated genes overlapped with those reported to be down-regulated in the G-CIMP+ as compared with G-CIMP− proneural GBMs and LGGs, respectively (Noushmehr et al. 2010; Turcan et al. 2012), which is significantly more than would be expected by chance (P ≤ 0.023, Fisher's exact test) (Fig. 4A). We selected four of the 18 genes to verify their expression level in the cell lines. Direct analysis of the expression of these IDH1R132H/WT-mediated down-regulated genes by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR validated the microarray findings and showed that the mRNA expression was significantly reduced for all four genes in the IDH1R132H/WT knock-in clones relative to parental HCT116 cells (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, a comparison of the expression levels of the same genes in 117 GBMs from the TCGA project (Verhaak et al. 2010) and 52 LGGs from the Turcan et al. (2012) cohort, for which gene expression data and IDH1 mutational status or G-CIMP classification were available, showed a corresponding down-regulation of these same genes in IDH1-mutant and G-CIMP+ gliomas relative to IDH1 wild-type and G-CIMP tumors (Fig. 4C).  Figure 4. Figure 4. Gene expression profiling of HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT cell lines. HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in clones and parental cells were analyzed using Affymetrix Human Genome 2.0 Arrays. (A) Hierarchical clustering of probes differentially expressed in HCT116 parent ... Relationship between IDH1 mutation-induced alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression  We next examined the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression changes induced by IDH1R132H/WT mutation in the HCT116 knock-ins. Analysis of all genes interrogated on both the DNA methylation and gene-expression platforms indicated a subtle yet significant negative correlation between the average change in gene expression and average change in DNA methylation for a given gene (Spearman's ρ = −0.021, P = 0.027; Supplemental Fig. 5). To further explore the relationship between changes in gene expression and DNA methylation, we analyzed the distribution of IDH1R132H/WT hyper- and hypomethylated loci relative to the canonical transcription start site (TSS) of the closest gene or CpG island. Interestingly, hypomethylated loci were depleted around the canonical TSSs and tended to occur toward the edges of the CpG island, whereas hypermethylated loci were more broadly distributed, with most occurring within CpG islands or CpG island “shores,” but many without (Supplemental Fig. 6), consistent with these loci having significant average preexisting methylation. Analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) data from wild-type HCT116 cells (Birney et al. 2007) showed that CpG sites that became hypermethylated in the HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT cells are depleted of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) relative to sites that become hypomethylated or remain unchanged (Supplemental Fig. 7A–E). These data suggest that sites that undergo hypermethylation in response to heterozygous expression of IDH1R132H/WT reside in domains that are less transcriptionally active and/or permissive in the parental HCT116 cells prior to IDH1R132H/WT knock-in. Although relatively enriched in Pol II, there was a decisive dip in Pol II binding surrounding the hypomethylated loci (Supplemental Fig. 7B). The finding that many sites that become hypermethylated may already be less active in the parental HCT116 cells may at least in part explain the apparent lack of correlation between DNA methylation changes and altered gene expression overall.  Global and gene-specific histone lysine methylation modifications correlate with DNA methylation and gene expression alterations in IDH1R132H/WT cells  To validate and further examine the relationship between epigenetic alterations and gene expression changes induced by IDH1 mutations, we analyzed in more detail three hypermethylated loci that exhibited a significant reduction in gene expression in HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in cells (UBB, RBP1, and SERPINB5) and one that did not (PDLIM2) using bisulfite sequencing analysis (Fig. 5). Primers were designed to amplify a region of several hundred base pairs and covered 1–3 of the CpG probes interrogated on the Illumina methylation array in each case. The methylation density, as estimated from the total number of methylated CpG sites among the total CpGs and alleles analyzed, showed a high correspondence with the methylation levels of underlying probes as assessed on the Illumina platform (Fig. 5, cf. A and B) and confirmed the increase in methylation observed in the IDH1R132H/WT knock-in clones relative to the parental HCT116 cell line (Fig. 5B). In contrast, there was no significant accumulation of DNA methylation in three clonal control lines that were subject to the same infection and selection protocol as the IDH1R132H/WT clones, but did not exhibit homologous recombination at the IDH1 locus (Supplemental Fig. 8), excluding the possibility that the hypermethylation was the result of a nontargeted effect or clonal selection. Comparison of the patterns of methylation across individual alleles in a population of parental and IDH1 knock-in cells suggested that hypermethylation resulted both from new methylation arising on relatively unmethylated alleles and from an increase in the density across alleles, suggesting a filling-in or spreading of preexisting methylation, depending on the gene analyzed (Fig. 5B).  Figure 5. Figure 5. Bisulfite sequence analysis of candidate CpG loci validates IDH1R132H/WT-induced DNA methylation changes. (A) Stripcharts of DNA methylation values (β) in HCT116 parental (WT: black) and IDH1R132H/WT (R132H: gray) cells are shown next to data ... Next, we examined levels of histone lysine methylation in IDH1R132H/WT knock-in and parental cells. Western blot analysis showed that the global levels of H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me3 were increased in KI-1 and KI-2 clones as compared with parental cells (Fig. 6A). These results are consistent with previous models overexpressing IDH mutants (W Xu et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2012; Turcan et al. 2012). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by quantitative PCR was used to examine the levels of these histone marks at the promoters of the same four hypermethyalted candidate loci. All four loci showed an accumulation of H3K9me3 that accompanied the hypermethylation of DNA (cf. Fig. 5B and Fig. 6B). H3K27me3 was much less abundant at these loci in the parental HCT116 cells and showed modest accumulation only at the SERPINB5 locus in the knock-in cells. Taken together, these data suggest that both global and gene-specific alterations in histone methylation occur in conjunction with DNA methylation in response to heterozygous mutation of IDH1R132H/WT and that the two can work together to reshape the epigenome.  Figure 6. Figure 6. Global and gene-specific histone lysine methylation coincides with IDH1R132H/WT-induced DNA methylation.

Gene silencing at specific IDH1R132H/WT-targeted loci is reversed using a DNA hypomethylating agent  The relationship between DNA methylation and gene silencing at specific loci affected by the IDH1R132H/WT mutation and the potential reversibility of these alterations was examined by determining the effects of exposure to a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor on DNA methylation and gene expression at the RBP1, UBB, and SERPINB5 genes. Parental HCT116 cells and knock-in clones were treated with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (decitabine, Dacogen, DAC) or control, and gene expression levels were determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 7A), while corresponding DNA methylation levels were determined by bisulfite sequencing (Fig. 7B). The UBB promoter, which was partially methylated (∼80%–89%) and exhibited low levels of gene expression in the parental line, approached complete methylation (90%–98%) (Figs. 5B, ,7B)7B) commensurate with a complete loss of UBB mRNA expression in the knock-in clones (Fig. 7A; see also Fig. 4B). Upon DAC treatment, DNA was hypomethylated, and a robust restoration of UBB gene expression was observed in both the parental and knock-in clones (Fig. 7A,B). Similarly, the promoter regions of SERPINB5 and RBP1, which were virtually unmethylated or partially methylated (28%–35%), respectively, and expressed in the parental HCT116 cell line, underwent an increase in methylation in the HCT116 knock-in clones (from 30% to 71% and 35% to 89%, respectively) (Figs. 5B, ,7B)7B) and showed a corresponding approximately twofold decrease in gene expression (Fig. 7A; see also Fig. 4B). DAC treatment resulted in hypomethylation of DNA and a restoration of RBP1 and SERPINB5 gene expression to control levels and induced a similar relative increase in both parental and knock-in clones (Fig. 7A,B). Taken together, our data support a model in which heterozygous IDH1 mutations can promote widespread alterations in DNA methylation, at least some of which contribute to altered gene expression patterns and can be reversed by treatment with a DNA hypomethylating agent.  Figure 7. Figure 7. Inhibition of DNA methylation results in restoration of gene expression for IDH1R132H/WT-repressed loci.

Go to: Discussion Heterozygous IDH1 mutations occur frequently in human tumors and display robust association with specific DNA methylation signatures. Using a somatic knock-in cell line system, we induced physiologic expression of the most frequently observed IDH1 mutation, IDH1R132H/WT, in a human cancer cell line. In this report we establish that genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation result from induction of the IDH1R132H/WT genotype. We found that the expression of the single IDH1R132H allele was sufficient to induce widespread alterations in DNA methylation, including both hypermethylation and hypomethylation events. Notably, the IDH1R132H/WT-mediated direction of methylation change was associated with the initial methylation state of the parental cells. Hypermethylation events tended to arise at CpG sites that were already moderately methylated (average 78%), whereas hypomethylation events occurred at CpG sites that were methylated to a lesser degree (average 17%), resulting in an accentuation of the bimodal distribution of CpG methylation. We further demonstrate that these alterations are similarly associated with IDH1 mutation and G-CIMP+ classification in gliomas and that the methylation signature identified can distinguish tumors with these features in two independent primary tumor cohorts. Together, these data provide evidence that heterozygous IDH1R132H/WT mutations drive epigenetic instability and initiate the methylation phenotypes observed in patients. Comparison of our data to that recently published by Turcan et al. (2012) showed a remarkably similar influence of the IDH1R132H mutation on the methylome, independent of the cell type of origin (HCT116 colon cancer cells vs. primary astrocytes) or method of introduction, with an estimated 9% of CpG sites significantly affected overall, 70% of which underwent hypermethylation in both studies. Interestingly, whereas there was considerable concordance between sites that undergo IDH1 mutation-driven hypermethylation in these cell culture models and sites preferentially hypermethylated in CIMP+ gliomas, there was little relationship between hypomethylated sites in the different models and primary tumors, suggesting that the mechanisms driving IDH1 mutation-associated hypermethylation may differ from those driving hypomethylation.  Tumor-associated IDH mutations are overwhelmingly observed to occur in the heterozygous state in primary tumors, and current theories have speculated that both the wild-type and mutant alleles are necessary for oncogenic function. IDH1 functions as a dimer, and previous studies have shown that the presence of wild-type IDH1 can stimulate the reductive enzymatic activity of mutant IDH1, potentially through formation of a highly active IDH1R132H-IDH1WT heterodimer (Bralten et al. 2011). Therefore, gene dosage of mutant and wild-type alleles has the potential to influence IDH1 enzyme activity and D-2-HG production, the relative ratios of α-KG depletion and D-2-HG accumulation, and ultimately the inhibition of Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. As D-2-HG is a weak antagonist of α-KG, competitive inhibition of α-KG-dependent dioxygenases requires a large fold excess of D-2-HG (W Xu et al. 2011). Therefore, a relatively small change in α-KG production resulting from replacement of one IDH1 allele can potentially have a large impact on α-KG-dependent enzymatic reactions or alternatively may poise the cell for D-2-HG-mediated effects.  Several nonexclusive hypotheses have been proposed as potential mechanistic links between IDH mutants, reduction of cellular α-KG levels and/or accumulation of D-2-HG, and epigenetic alterations in cancer cells. One potential mechanism involves inhibition of TET proteins on the flux between 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), and cytosine. The TET family proteins catalyze the conversion of 5-mC to 5-hmC (Tahiliani et al. 2009; Ito et al. 2010) and higher oxidation states, including 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC) (He et al. 2011; Ito et al. 2011). These modified methylcytosine bases are likely intermediates in active DNA demethylation arising from removal by the base excision repair machinery and replacement with cytosine (Wu and Zhang 2010; Cortellino et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2011; He et al. 2011). Recent advances have provided insight into the roles of TET enzymes on the regulation of 5-hmC, the cellular context and genomic distribution of 5-hmC, and the importance of 5-hmC in regulation of transcription and cellular differentiation (Ito et al. 2010; Ficz et al. 2011; Jin et al. 2011b; Kinney et al. 2011; Koh et al. 2011; Pastor et al. 2011; Ruzov et al. 2011; Stroud et al. 2011; Szulwach et al. 2011; Williams et al. 2011; Wossidlo et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2011a,b; Y Xu et al. 2011; Nestor et al. 2012). Bisulfite-based technologies, including the Illumina methylation platform used here, do not distinguish between 5-mC and 5-hmC (Nestor et al. 2010). Thus, the methylation values reported at any one CpG site represents the sum of the two, and there may be some CpG sites that are predominately one or the other. This could be one explanation for the hyper- and/or hypomethylation observed in response to IDH mutation in ours and other (Turcan et al. 2012) studies. Hypermethylation events could occur through inhibition of TET proteins and accumulation of 5-mC that would ensue due to the decreased conversion of 5mC to 5-hmC and decreased DNA demethylation (Wu and Zhang 2010; Cortellino et al. 2011; Dahl et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2011). Apparent hypomethylation could result from the conversion of all preexisting 5-hmC to cytosine by base excision repair (e.g., thymidine glycosylase or MBD4) and/or the inability to maintain this mark during replication (Valinluck and Sowers 2007; Hashimoto et al. 2012). In the absence of TET function, the inability to generate new 5-hmC would lead to a depletion of 5-hmC and an increase in unmodified cytosine. Consistent with this, whereas IDH mutations in gliomas (Noushmehr et al. 2010) and in AMLs (Figueroa et al. 2010a) are associated with a CpG island hypermethylation phenotype, TET2 loss-of-function in myeloid tumors has been associated with both the CIMP phenotype (Figueroa et al. 2010a) as well as global hypomethylation (Ko et al. 2010). The potential contribution of TET inhibition to the IDH-mutation driven epigenetic alterations is further confounded by the findings that whereas 5-hmC is depleted in a number of cancers and is reduced upon overexpression of IDH1R132H in astrocytes (Turcan et al. 2012), total 5-hmC levels do not appear to correlate with IDH mutations in primary gliomas (Jin et al. 2011a). Any influence that IDH mutations and/or TET mutations might have on the site-specific patterns of 5-hmC across the genome in cancer cells remains to be determined.  Another mechanism involves effects on histone methylation patterns. Of particular interest are members of the Jumonji-C domain family of histone demethylases (JHDMs), which demethylate histone lysine residues in an α-KG-dependent manner. D-2-HG competitively inhibits JHDM activity in vitro (Chowdhury et al. 2011; W Xu et al. 2011). Overexpression of mutant IDH leads to alterations in histone methylation levels in cell lines (W Xu et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2012; Turcan et al. 2012), and IDH mutations are associated with increased histone methylation in primary human tumors (W Xu et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2012). Our data indicate that heterozygous expression of IDH1R132H/WT results in both global and site-specific alterations in histone lysine methylation patterns. We find that whereas the global levels of multiple histone H3 and H4 methylation modifications were increased, consistent with a broad inhibition of histone demethylation, hypermethylation at H3K9 in particular accompanied site-specific hypermethylation of DNA at several genes that were down-regulated in IDH1R132H/WT knock-in cells. This is consistent with recent work by Turcan et al. (2012) who similarly showed a concomitant accumulation of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation at several genes that undergo epigenetic silencing in response to ectopic expression of mutant IDH1 in human astrocytes. Although it is currently unknown whether DNA methylation or H3K9me3 is the primary mediator of gene silencing in these cases, a recent study by Lu et al. (2012) showed that increased H3K9me3 could occur independently of DNA methylation changes at the Cebpa and Adipoq loci in IDH2R172K-expressing mouse fibroblasts and, further, that the global accumulation of H3K9me3 preceded that of DNA methylation in human astrocytes ectopically expressing IDH1R132H. Although the extent to which mutant IDH-driven alterations in DNA methylation are dependent upon changes in H3K9me3 (or vice versa) remains to be determined, these data suggest that altered H3K9me3, through the D-2-HG-mediated inhibition of an H3K9 demethylase, may underlie DNA hypermethylation-associated gene silencing at least at some loci. Close mechanistic ties are thought to exist between these two modifications, particularly in the maintenance of constitutive heterochromatin and the silencing of repetitive elements (Lehnertz et al. 2003; Cedar and Bergman 2009; Hashimoto et al. 2010). Targeted deposition of H3K9me2/3 can direct de novo DNA methylation in an integrated transgene system (Schultz et al. 2002) and precedes de novo methylation of stem cell genes during lineage specification of embryonic stem cells (Cedar and Bergman 2009). At present, the extent to which D-2-HG-mediated inhibition of one or more α-KG-dependent enzymes is responsible for the pathogenesis of IDH mutation-associated tumors remains to be determined. Future studies aimed at the integrated analyses of histone methylation and DNA (hydroxy)methylation at a genome-wide scale will be necessary to resolve the relative contribution to IDH mutation-associated cancers.  We examined gene-expression alterations resulting from induction of IDH1R132H/WT in HCT116 and revealed a subset of 19 genes that demonstrated significant changes in gene expression. Nearly all of the dysregulated genes (18 of 19) were down-regulated and exhibited concomitant hypermethylation. In contrast, there was no significant association between hypomethylation and gene expression in our model. This is perhaps not surprising considering that most of the mutant IDH-driven hypomethylation events affected sites that had only low levels of methylation to begin with (average β = 0.17) and occurred more frequently at sites away from the canonical TSSs and toward the edges of CpG islands. Whereas the inverse correlation between the methylation status of CpG sites within CpG island-containing promoters and gene expression is well-described, recent genome-wide studies indicate that gene body methylation is positively correlated with gene expression in normal cells (Lister et al. 2009; Rauch et al. 2009; Maunakea et al. 2010) and, furthermore, that loss of methylation in such regions in cancer cells correlates with gene repression (Hon et al. 2012). Even in DNMT triple knock-out mouse embryonic stem cells (DNMT TKO) (Karimi et al. 2011), where there is a dramatic demethylation of the genome, surprisingly few genes (n = 239) are significantly up-regulated.  Somewhat surprisingly, despite the widespread hypermethylation events observed, the number of significantly down-regulated genes was relatively small. Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with previous reports showing that only a small fraction (17%) of loci hypermethylated in G-CIMP+ primary GBMs were associated with a concomitant decrease in gene expression (Noushmehr et al. 2010). A growing number of studies indicate a low correlation between DNA hypermethylation and gene expression at a global level in cancer cells (Hahn et al. 2008; Pike et al. 2008; Takeshima et al. 2009). This appears to be in part because many of the genes that undergo DNA hypermethylation in cancer cells are already marked by repressive chromatin and exist in a relatively low expression state in the parental cells (Sproul et al. 2011). Consistent with this idea, CpG sites that became hypermethylated in response to IDH1R132H/WT were already, on average, partially methylated and depleted of marks of active transcription (H3K4me3) and Pol II occupancy in the parental HCT116 cells relative to sites that became hypomethylated or were unaffected. The finding that a significant proportion of CpG sites prone to hypermethylation in the HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in cells are similarly hypermethylated in IDH mutant and/or G-CIMP+ gliomas and IDH1R132H-overexpressing cells suggests that the metabolic disturbance imposed by IDH mutations may impact upon a common set of vulnerable genomic sites. One common feature may be preexisting marking by repressive chromatin. In particular, genes that are targets of the Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) and marked by H3K27me3 in embryonic or adult stem cells are highly prone to CpG island hypermethylation across tumor types (Ohm et al. 2007; Schlesinger et al. 2007; Widschwendter et al. 2007; Gal-Yam et al. 2008; Easwaran et al. 2012), including those hypermethylation events associated with the CIMP phenotype (Fang et al. 2011; Easwaran et al. 2012; Turcan et al. 2012). Indeed, sites that underwent IDH-driven hypermethylation in our HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in cells are enriched in Polycomb target genes, and there was even greater enrichment among those commonly hypermethylated between the HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT knock-in cells and astrocytes overexpressing the IDH1R132H mutant or G-CIMP+ LGGs (Turcan et al. 2012) (Supplemental Table 6), suggesting that this may be an common underlying feature. In stem cells, marking by the Polycomb complex is thought to keep key developmental regulators in a low but poised transcriptional state to prevent lineage commitment and differentiation and to maintain self-renewal capacity. It has been proposed that the replacement or superimposition of such reversible chromatin-mediated repression by the more stable silencing associated with promoter DNA methylation may contribute to tumor progression by reducing the epigenetic plasticity that would normally allow stem/progenitor cells to activate differentiation programs or respond to cellular stress (Gal-Yam et al. 2008; Easwaran et al. 2012). Consistent with this idea, we found that the IDH-driven hypermethylated sites seen here were enriched in genes that play a role in the cellular response to extracellular stimuli and cell-type-specific differentiation functions (Supplemental Table 2).  Although small in number, we identified several candidate genes that are targets of mutant IDH1-mediated de novo epigenetic silencing, including RBP1, UBB, and SERPINB5. Interestingly, over 33% of the genes down-regulated in HCT116 IDH1R132H/WT cells overlapped with those reported to be down-regulated in the G-CIMP+ as compared with G-CIMP− proneural GBMs and LGGs (Noushmehr et al. 2010; Turcan et al. 2012). RBP1 has been demonstrated to be one of the genes most frequently subject to epigenetic silencing in G-CIMP+ primary GBMs (Noushmehr et al. 2010; Laffaire et al. 2011) and was also among the most strikingly subject to concordant hypermethylation and down-regulation in our model. In addition to gliomas, RBP1 is also silenced in conjunction with promoter hypermethylation in several cancer types, including lymphomas, esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, and gastric carcinomas (Esteller et al. 2002; Mizuiri et al. 2005; Shutoh et al. 2005; Chu et al. 2006). Involved in the transport of retinol, RBP1 regulates intracellular retinoic acid (RA) homeostasis. RA influences many important and diverse functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation, and retinoid signaling is often compromised in early carcinogenesis (Tang and Gudas 2011). RBP1 down-regulation in cancer promotes loss of cellular differentiation and tumor progression through inhibition of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) activity and derepression of PI3K/Akt signaling (Farias et al. 2005a,b). Further, RBP1 has been proposed as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer, as its silencing contributes to cell proliferation and migration (Toki et al. 2010). Additionally, markers for RA signaling, including RBP1 mRNA, have been shown to be significantly decreased in long-term GBM survivors (associated with IDH1 mutation) and may be one potential area to target therapeutically (Barbus et al. 2011). We also identified UBB, coding for a highly conserved polyubiquitin precursor, as a target of IDH1R132H/WT-driven epigenetic silencing. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation plays important roles in the control of numerous cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell-cycle progression and transcriptional regulation, and abnormalities in ubiquitin-mediated processes are involved in several pathological conditions, including malignant transformation (Hershko and Ciechanover 1998). At the UBB locus, a seemingly small increase in methylation led to drastic down-regulation of the gene. Although we cannot completely explain this observation, it may be that the expression observed in the parental cells derives from a relatively few (<10%) unmethylated alleles. Nevertheless, treatment with DAC led to an up-regulation of gene expression that was proportional to the decrease in DNA methylation. Even in the parental line, which is already substantially methylated, treatment with DAC results in demethylation and a sixfold up-regulation of the gene. These data are consistent with the idea that many of the sites that become hypermethylated in response to IDH1 mutation are already partially methylated and repressed in the parental cell line.  While the high frequency, specificity, and early timing of IDH1 mutations provide strong evidence for their importance in tumorigenesis, the precise oncogenic consequences of these mutations remain unclear. Together, the presented data support that IDH1R132H/WT mutations induce widespread alterations of DNA methylation and contribute to the global DNA methylation phenotypes observed in patients. Future studies of mutant IDH1 and the cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways that it targets will be critical to understand the malignant properties of these deadly cancers.  Mutations in the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are a common feature of a major subset of primary human brain cancers. These mutations occur at a single amino acid residue of the IDH1 active site resulting in loss of the enzyme’s ability to catalyze conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. However, only a single copy of the gene is mutated in tumors, raising the possibility that the mutations do not result in a simple loss of function. Here we show that cancer-associated IDH1 mutations result in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(−)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Structural studies demonstrate that when R132 is mutated to histidine, residues in the active site are shifted to produce structural changes consistent with reduced oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate and acquisition of the ability to convert α-ketoglutarate to 2HG. Excess accumulation of 2HG has been shown to lead to an elevated risk of malignant brain tumors in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism. Similarly, in human malignant gliomas harboring IDH1 mutations, we find dramatically elevated levels of 2HG. These data demonstrate that the IDH1 mutations result in production of the onco-metabolite 2HG, and suggest that the excess 2HG which accumulates in vivo contributes to the formation and malignant progression of gliomas.  Mutations in the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are found in approximately 80% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas in humans 1–3. These mutations occur at a single amino acid residue of IDH1, arginine 132, which is most commonly mutated to histidine (R132H)1, 3, 4. Only a single copy of the gene has been found to be mutated in tumors 1–6. Many of the high grade gliomas with IDH1 mutations are secondary glioblastomas that have progressed from lower grade lesions 1–3, 5. When analyzed in relation to other genes implicated in brain tumors, the compiled evidence suggests that IDH1 is often the first mutation that occurs 2. While these findings suggest that IDH1 mutations are selected for early during tumorigenesis, why mutations in a single allele of IDH1 result in predilection for malignant progression is uncertain. It has been reported that the R132H mutation disrupts the ability of IDHl to convert isocitrate to αKG 3, 7, but the consequences of this impaired enzymatic activity on cellular metabolism have not been systematically analyzed. For example, while R132 IDH1 mutations might reduce the rate of cytosolic αKG production as suggested by others 7, whether IDH1 mutations can influence the enzyme’s ability to act on αKG as a substrate has not been explored. This latter activity may be particularly important for the tumorigenic role of IDH1 mutations since cytosolic αKG is in equilibrium via transamination with the glutamate that plays a unique role in glial cell physiology, and IDH1 mutations are especially prevalent in malignant gliomas.  Go to: Metabolite profiling identifies elevated 2HG levels in IDH1 mutant expressing cells To understand the impact of IDH1 mutation on cellular metabolism, we profiled metabolites to identify changes in metabolite levels in cells expressing R132 mutant IDH1 compared with cells expressing wild-type IDH1. To initiate these studies, we stably transfected U87MG glioblastoma cells, which are wild-type for IDH1, with myc-tagged wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1. Cells expressing either myc-tagged wild-type or mutant IDH1 were used for metabolite profiling experiments (Figure 1a). Metabolites extracted from exponentially growing cells were profiled by liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In initial survey analyses, full-scan LC-MS in negative ion mode (exact mass) was used to examine differences in metabolite species with an m/z between 110 and 1000. Relative quantitative data were collected for approximately 850 ions and identities were proposed by comparison with known human metabolites. Identities of > 100 species identified by a combination of exact mass and retention time match to purified standards were assigned 8. There were no significant differences between cells expressing wild-type IDH1 when compared with parental cells. The levels of most observed ions were also similar between wild type and R132H mutant IDH1 expressing cells (Figure 1b), with no significant changes found in canonical TCA cycle species (P > 0.05 for citrate, isocitrate, αKG, succinate, fumarate, and malate). However, three species were significantly more abundant in R132H mutant IDH1 expressing cells (P < 0.001 for each). The mass of the one of these ions matched precisely to 2HG (expected m/z 147.0299, measured 147.0299). The other ions co-eluted with 2HG, and had masses consistent with the sodium adduct and a dehydrated form of 2HG. Subsequent injection of 2HG standard confirmed a retention time match to the biological peak, and that it forms all three of the observed ions during LC-MS ionization (data not shown). The cellular accumulation of 2HG was quantified by targeted triple-quadrupole LC-MS-MS analysis of cell extracts (Figure 1c). The structure of 2HG is close to αKG, the product of the IDH1 enzyme. Thus, the sole metabolite identified by untargeted metabolite profiling to be markedly altered by R132H mutant IDH1 expression was also implicated by its structure to be IDHl-related.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Cells expressing human R132H IDH1 contain dramatically elevated levels of 2HG The accumulation of 2HG was not restricted to cell extracts as 2HG was found to rapidly accumulate in the medium of cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 (Figure 1d). No appreciable 2HG could be found in the medium of wild-type cells or cells transfected with wild-type IDH1 (Figure 1d). Isotope-labeling experiments on whole cells using uniformly labeled 13C-glutamine as a culture media nutrient demonstrated that the carbons in 2HG are derived from glutamine, with reasonably high overall pathway flux from glutamine through glutamate and αKG to 2HG. Moreover, labeling experiments did not demonstrate any other major alterations in central carbon metabolic flux in cells expressing R132H mutant 2HG (data not shown). The presence of a myc epitope tag did not alter activity of R132H mutant IDH1. Despite being expressed at lower levels than the myc-tagged R132H IDH1, cells transfected with untagged R132H IDH1 demonstrated a comparable increase in 2HG production (Supplementary Figure 1). To determine whether 2HG production in cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 is unique to U87MG cells, we stably expressed wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 in wild-type IDHl-expressing LN-18 glioblastoma cells (Supplementary Figure 2a). Similar to results obtained with U87MG cells, the major difference in metabolite levels observed in LN-18 cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 was an increased level of 2HG (Supplementary Figure 2b).  Go to: Mutant IDH1 directly converts αKG to 2HG The R132H mutation has been reported to result in loss of function for enzyme activity3, 7. However, in these studies only the NADP+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to αKG was assessed. To understand how IDH1 activity is altered in cells by the presence of R132H mutant IDH1, we expressed increasing amounts of wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 separately or in combination and assessed isocitrate-dependent NADPH production and αKG-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates. Consistent with published results, expression of R132H mutant IDH1 resulted in no measurable production of NADPH from isocitrate, and isocitrate-dependent NADPH production increased with increasing amounts of wild-type enzyme (Supplementary Figure 3a, b). The ability of the wild-type enzyme to generate NADPH was decreased slightly by co-expression of the R132H mutant IDH1. Opposite results were obtained, however, when NADPH consumption was measured in the presence of αKG. NADPH consumption by wild-type enzyme was not observed, while R132H mutant IDH1 expression resulted in αKG-dependent NADPH consumption (Supplementary Figure 3c). Although the overall consumption of NADPH was slow, if anything co-expression of wild-type IDH1 with R132H mutant IDH1 facilitated the αKG-dependent consumption of NADPH. These findings demonstrate that in contrast to wild-type IDH1, R132H mutant IDH1 promotes an NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG. Furthermore, as this reduction was not inhibited by co-expression of wild-type IDH1, these data suggest that the novel activity of mutant IDH1 can persist even in the presence of a wild-type IDH1 allele. In fact, it is possible that in the case of a heterodimer of wild-type and mutant IDH1, the αKG and NADPH produced locally by the wild-type subunit could be used as substrates for the mutant subunit explaining the decrease in NADPH production observed in lysates when wild-type and mutant IDH1 are co-expressed.  To understand how R132 mutations alter the enzymatic properties of IDH1, wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 proteins were produced and purified from E coli. When NADP+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate was measured using purified wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1 protein, it was confirmed that R132H mutation impairs the ability of IDH1 to catalyze this reaction3, 7, as evident by the loss in binding affinity for both isocitrate and MgCl2 along with a 1000-fold decrease in catalytic turnover (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 4a). In contrast, when NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG was assessed using either wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1 protein, only R132H mutant could catalyze this reaction (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 4b). Part of this increased rate of αKG reduction results from an apparent increase in affinity for both the cofactor NADPH and substrate αKG in the R132H mutant IDH1 (Figure 2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that while the R132H mutation leads to a loss of enzymatic function for oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, this mutation also results in a gain of enzyme function for the NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG.  Figure 2 Figure 2 R132H mutation alters the enzymatic properties of IDH1 Reduction of the α-ketone in αKG can result in 2HG. To determine whether R132H mutant protein directly produced 2HG from αKG we examined the product of the mutant IDH1 reaction using negative ion mode triple quadrupole electrospray LC-MS. These experiments confirmed that 2HG was the direct product of NADPH-dependent αKG reduction by the purified R132H mutant protein through comparison with known metabolite standards (Figure 3a). Conversion of αKG to isocitrate was not observed. To determine the chirality of the 2HG produced, we derivatized the products of the R132H reaction with diacetyl-L-tartaric anhydride, which allowed us to separate the (S) and (R) enantiomers of 2HG by simple reverse-phase LC and detect the products by tandem mass spectrometry 9 (Figure 3b). The peaks corresponding to the (S) and (R) isomers of 2HG were confirmed using racemic and R(−)-2HG standards. The reaction product from R132H co-eluted with R(−)-2HG peak, demonstrating that the R(−) stereoisomer is the product produced from αKG by R132H mutant IDH1.  Figure 3 Figure 3 R132H mutation in IDH1 results in production of R(−)-2HG To determine whether the altered enzyme properties resulting from R132H mutation were shared by other R132 mutations found in human gliomas, recombinant R132C, R132L and R132S mutant IDH1 proteins were generated and the enzymatic properties assessed. Similar to R132H mutant protein, R132C, R132L, and R132S mutations all result in a gain-of-function for NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG (Supplementary Figure 4). Thus, in addition to impaired oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, one common feature shared among the IDH1 mutations found in human gliomas is the ability to catalyze direct NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG.  Go to: Structural studies revealed a distinct active site of R132H mutant IDH1 To define how R132 mutations alter the enzymatic properties of IDH1, the crystal structure of R132H mutant IDH1 bound to αKG, NADPH, and Ca2+ was solved at 2.1 Å resolution (see Supplementary Table 1 for crystallographic data and refinement statistics). The overall quaternary structure of the homodimeric R132H mutant enzyme adopts the same closed catalytically competent conformation (shown as a monomer in Figure 4a) that has been previously described for the wild-type enzyme 10.  Figure 4Figure 4 Figure 4 Structural analysis of R132H mutant IDH1 Two important features were noted by the change of R132 to histidine: the effect on conformation equilibrium and the reorganization of the active-site. Located atop a β-sheet in the relatively rigid small domain, R132 acts as a gate-keeper residue and appears to orchestrate the hinge movement between the open and closed conformations. The guanidinium moiety of R132 swings from the open to the closed conformation with a distance of nearly 8 Å. Substitution of histidine for arginine is likely to change the equilibrium in favor of the closed conformation that forms the catalytic cleft for cofactor and substrate to bind efficiently, which partly explains the high-affinity for NADPH exhibited by the R132H mutant enzyme. This feature may be advantageous for the NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG to R(−)-2HG in an environment where NADPH concentrations are low. Secondly, closer examination of the catalytic pocket of the mutant IDH1 structure in comparison to the wild-type enzyme showed not only the expected loss of key salt-bridge interactions between the guanidinium of R132 and the α/β carboxylates of isocitrate, as well as changes in the network that coordinates the metal ion, but also an unexpected reorganization of the active-site. Mutation to histidine resulted in a significant shift in position of the highly conserved residues Y139 from the A subunit and K212′ from the B subunit (Figures 4b & c), both of which are thought to be critical for catalysis by this enzyme family11. In particular, the hydroxyl moiety of Y139 now occupies the space of the β-carboxylate of isocitrate.  The electron density in the active site was not sufficient to assign αKG and its orientation unambiguously. We have modeled the substrate based on the available electron density, taking into consideration the coordination between the carbonyl oxygen of αKG and the calcium ion as well as an orientation of αKG that would produce R(−)-2HG, the experimental product. The model required a significant repositioning of αKG compared to isocitrate, such that the distal carboxylate of αKG now points upward to make new contacts with N96 and S94. Overall, this single R132H mutation results in formation of a distinct active site compared to wild-type IDH1.  Go to: 2HG levels are elevated in human glioma samples Our data demonstrate that mutation of R132 can result in the ability of IDH1 to generate R(−)-2HG from αKG. To determine if 2HG production is characteristic of tumors harboring mutations in IDH1, metabolites were extracted from human malignant gliomas that were either wild-type or mutant for IDH1 (see Supplementary Table 2 for summary of tumor characteristics). It has been suggested that αKG levels are decreased in cells transfected with mutant IDH17. We observe that the average αKG level from 12 tumor samples harboring various R132 mutations was slightly less than the average αKG level observed in 10 tumors which are wild-type for IDH1. This difference in αKG was not statistically significant, and a range of αKG levels was observed in both wild-type and mutant tumors (Figure 5). Similarly, a range of levels was observed for other proximal TCA cycle metabolites with no significant differences observed between wild-type IDH1 tumors and tumors with R132 IDH1 mutations. In contrast, increased 2HG levels were found in all tumors that contained an R132 IDH1 mutation (Figure 5, Supplementary Table 2). All R132 mutant IDH1 tumors examined had between 5 and 35 μmol of 2HG per gram of tumor, while tumors with wild-type IDH1 had over 100 fold less 2HG. This increase in 2HG in R132 mutant tumors was statistically significant (p<0.0001). We confirmed that (R)-2HG was the isomer present in tumor samples (data not shown). Together these data establish that the novel enzymatic activity associated with R132 mutations in IDH1 results in the production of 2HG in human brain tumors that harbor these mutations.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Human malignant gliomas containing R132 mutations in IDH1 contain increased concentrations of 2HG Go to: Discussion 2HG is known to accumulate in the inherited metabolic disorder 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. This disease is caused by deficiency in the enzyme 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, which converts 2HG to αKG12. Patients with 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase deficiencies accumulate 2HG in the brain as assessed by MRI and CSF analysis, develop leukoencephalopathy, and have an increased risk of developing brain tumors 13–15.  Furthermore, elevated brain levels of 2HG result in increased ROS levels16, 17, potentially contributing to an increased risk of cancer, and alterations in NADPH metabolism resulting from mutant IDH1 expression could further exacerbate this effect. The ability of 2HG to act as an NMDA receptor agonist may contribute to this effect 16. 2HG may also be toxic to cells by competitively inhibiting glutamate and/or αKG utilizing enzymes. These include transaminases which allow utilization of glutamate nitrogen for amino and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and αKG-dependent prolyl hydroxylases such as those that regulate Hif1α levels. Alterations in Hif1α have been reported to result from mutant IDH1 protein expression 7. Regardless of mechanism, it appears likely that the gain-of-function ability of cells to produce 2HG as a result of R132 mutations in IDH1 contributes to tumorigenesis. Patients with 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency have a high risk of CNS malignancy 15. The ability of mutant IDH1 to directly act on αKG may explain the prevalence of IDH1 mutations in tumors from CNS tissue, which are unique in their high level of glutamate uptake and its ready conversion to αKG in the cytosol18, thereby providing high levels of substrate for 2HG production. Myeloid cells also display a high ability to metabolize glutamine and recently R132 IDH1 mutations have also been described in a subset of AML19. The apparent co-dominance of the activity of mutant IDH1 with that of the wild-type enzyme is consistent with the genetics of the disease, in which only a single copy of the gene is mutated. As discussed above, the wild-type IDH1 could directly provide NADPH and αKG to the mutant enzyme. These data also demonstrate that mutation of R132 to histidine, serine, cysteine, glycine, or leucine share a common ability to catalyze the NADPH-dependent conversion of αKG to 2HG. These findings help clarify why mutations at other amino acid residues of IDH1, including other residues essential for catalytic activity, are not found. Finally, these findings have clinical implications in that they suggest that 2HG production will identify patients with IDH1 mutant brain tumors. This will be important for prognosis as patients with IDH1 mutations live longer than patients with gliomas characterized by other mutations5. In addition, patients with lower grade gliomas may benefit by the therapeutic inhibition of 2HG production. Inhibition of 2HG production by mutant IDH1 might slow or halt conversion of lower grade glioma into lethal secondary glioblastoma, changing the course of the disease.  Go to: Methods Summary R132H, R132C, R132L and R132S mutations were introduced into human IDH1 by standard molecular biology techniques. 293T and human glioma U87MG and LN-18 cell lines were transfected using standard techniques. Protein expression levels were determined by Western blot. Metabolites were extracted from cultured cells and from tissue samples using 80% aqueous methanol (−80°C) as previously reported 8. Metabolite levels in samples were determined by negative mode electrospray LC-MS. For untargeted profiling, extract components were resolved using reverse phase HPLC running and metabolites were detected in ultra-high resolution mode (resolution ~100,000) by accurate mass ion-trap MS, collecting at one scan/second over an m/z range of 110–1100. For targeted evaluation of 2HG, αKG, and other TCA intermediates, extracts were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC system and metabolites detected by triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry, using multiple-reaction monitoring. Enzymatic activity in cell lysates was assessed by following a change in NADPH fluorescence over time in the presence of isocitrate and NADP, or αKG and NADPH. For enzyme assays using recombinant IDH1 enzyme, proteins were purified from E coli using Ni affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Enzymatic activity for recombinant IDH1 protein was assessed by following a change in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm using a stop-flow spectrophotometer. Chirality of 2HG was determined as described previously9. For crystallography studies, purified R132H IDH1 was pre-incubated with NADPH, calcium chloride, and αKG. Crystals were obtained at 20°C by vapor diffusion equilibration using 3 μL drops mixed 2:1 (protein:precipitant) against a well-solution of MES pH 6.5 and PEG 6000. Patient tumor samples were obtained after informed consent as part of a UCLA IRB-approved research protocol, collected by surgical resection, snap frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The IDH1 mutation status of each sample was determined as described previously3.  Go to: Supplemental Methods Cloning, Expression, and Purification of ICDH1 wt and mutants in E coli  The open reading frame (ORF) clone of human isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (cDNA) (IDH1; ref. ID NM_005896) was purchased from Invitrogen in pENTR221 (Carlsbad, CA) and Origene Inc. in pCMV6 (Rockville, MD). To transfect cells with wild-type or mutant IDH1, standard molecular biology mutagenesis techniques were utilized to alter the DNA sequence at base pair 395 of the ORF in pCMV6 to introduce base pair change from guanine to adenine, which resulted in a change in the amino acid code at position 132 from arginine (wt) to histidine (mutant; or R132H), and confirmed by standard DNA sequencing methods. For 293T cell transfection, wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 were subcloned into pCMV-Sport6 with or without a carboxy-terminal Myc-DDK-tag. For stable cell line generation, constructs in pCMV6 were used. For expression in E coli, the coding region was amplified from pENTR221 by PCR using primers designed to add NDEI and XHO1 restrictions sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends respectively. The resultant fragment was cloned into vector pET41a (EMD Biosciences, Madison, Wl) to enable the E coli expression of C-terminus His8-tagged protein. Site directed mutagenesis was performed on the pET41a-ICHD1 plasmid using the QuikChange® MultiSite-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA)to change G395 to A, resulting in the Arg to His mutation. R132C, R132L and R132S mutants were introduced into pET41a-ICHD1 in an analogous way.  Wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in and purified from the E coli Rosetta™ strain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as follows. Cells were grown in LB (20 μg/ml Kanamycin) at 37°C with shaking until OD600 reaches 0.6. The temperature was changed to 18°C and protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to final concentration of 1 mM. After 12–16 hours of IPTG induction, cells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (20mM Tris, pH7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 % glycerol) and disrupted by microfluidation. The 20,000g supernatant was loaded on metal chelate affinity resin (MCAC) equilibrated with Nickel Column Buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH7.4, 500mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and washed for 20 column volumes. Elution from the column was effected by a 20 column-volume linear gradient of 10% to 100% Nickel Column Buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 500 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol) in Nickel Column Buffer A). Fractions containing the protein of interest were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed twice against a 200-volume excess of Gel Filtration Buffer (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris 7.5, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM MnSO4, 10% glycerol), then concentrated to 10 ml using Centricon (Millipore, Billerica, MA) centrifugal concentrators. Purification of active dimers was achieved by applying the concentrated eluent from the MCAC column to a Sephacryl S-200 (GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) column equilibrated with Gel Filtration Buffer and eluting the column with 20 column volumes of the same buffer. Fractions corresponding to the retention time of the dimeric protein were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled for storage at −80°C.  Cell lines and Cell Culture  293T cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagles Medium) with 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected using pCMV-6-based IDH1 constructs in six-well plates with Fugene 6 (Roche) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Parental vector pCMV6 (no insert), pCMV6-wt IDH1 or pCMV6-R132H were transfected into human glioblastoma cell lines (U87MG; LN-18 (ATCC, HTB-14 and CRL-2610; respectively) cultured in DMEM with 10 % fetal bovine serum. Approximately 24 hrs after transfection, the cell cultures were transitioned to medium containing G418 sodium salt at concentrations of either 500 ug/ml (U87MG) or 750 ug/ml (LN-18) to select stable transfectants. Pooled populations of G418 resistant cells were generated and expression of either wild-type IDH1 or R132 IDH1 was confirmed by standard Western blot analysis.  Western blot  For transient transfection experiments in 293T cells, cells were lysed 72 hours after transfection with standard RIPA buffer. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with goat-anti-IDHc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc49996) or rabbit-anti-MYC tag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology #2278) and then detected with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat or HRP-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc2004). IDH1 antibody to confirm expression of both wild-type and R132H IDH1 was obtained from Proteintech. The IDH2 mouse monoclonal antibody used was obtained from Abeam.  Metabolite extraction  48h prior to profiling the appropriate culture medium was changed to identical medium with dialyzed fetal calf serum. All cells were grown in 10 cm tissue culture dishes, and the medium was replaced again with identical medium 24 h and 1h prior to metabolite extraction. All samples were harvested at a non-confluent density (1.5 – 2.0 × 106 cells). Metabolism was quenched and metabolites extracted by aspiration of media and immediate addition of 3.6 mL 80:20 methanol:water at −80°C, and transfer to a dry-ice bed to simultaneously lyse cells and quench metabolism. Cell remnants were scraped from the tissue culture dish and transferred, along with the methanol:water, into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was moved to a new tube. A 1 mL portion of the supernatant was then dried under nitrogen gas, dissolved in 100 μL of aq. LC buffer, spun at 13,000 × g for 10 min to remove any remaining debris and analyzed by LC-MS within 24h, as described below. At the time of harvest, an equivalently treated plate to each of those harvested was used to determine the total cell count, enabling subsequent normalization of LCMS signal intensities between culture dishes.  Non-targeted LC-MS  Samples were analyzed using high resolution (~100,000 fwhm resolution) exact mass ion-trap mass spectrometry in full-scan mode (1 scan/second, set to high dynamic range), coupled to liquid chromatography via negative mode electrospray ionization (−3.0 kV). The scan range was picked to avoid abundant ions like phosphate and sulfate entering the ion trap, and was set as follows: 0–3 min: no scanning, 3–5 min: 85–800 m/z, 5.0–6.7 min: 100–800 m/z, 6.7–9.0 min: 85–800 m/z, 9–16 min: 110–1000 m/z, 16–24 min: 220–1000 m/z. For chromatography, a Synergi Hydro-RP, 100mm × 2 mm, 2.1 μm particle size column was used (Phenomonex, Torrance, CA). Solvent A was 10 mM tributylamine and 15 mM acetic acid in 97% water/3% methanol. Solvent B was methanol. The gradient was (t=0–2.5 min, 0% B; t=5–7.5 min, 20% B; t=13 min, 55% B; t=15.5–18.5 min, 95% B; 19–25 min 0% B). The flow rate was 200 μL/min.  Targeted Liquid Chromatography—Mass Spectrometry, 2HG and TCA metabolite measurements  To detect secreted 2HG in culture media, 500 μL aliquots of conditioned media were collected, mixed 80:20 with methanol, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The resulting supernatant was collected and stored at −80°C prior to LC-MS to assess 2HG levels. To measure whole-cell associated metabolites, media was aspirated and cells were harvested as described above. Two different liquid chromatography (LC) separation methods were used, each coupled by negative electrospray ionization (ESI, −3.0 kV) to triple-quadrupole mass spectrometers operating in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, with MS parameters optimized on infused metabolite standard solutions. In both methods, metabolites were separated by reversed phase chromatography using 10 mM tributyl-amine as an ion pairing agent in the aqueous mobile phase, according to a variant of a previously reported method20. The first method allowed resolution of TCA metabolites: t = 0, 50% B; t = 5, 95% B; t= 7, 95% B; t= 8, 0% B, where B refers to an organic mobile phase of 100% methanol. The second method was specific for 2HG, running a fast linear gradient from 50%–95% B (buffers as defined above) over 5 minutes. In both methods, the column was a Synergi Hydro-RP, 100mm × 2 mm, 2.1 μm particle size (Phenomonex), as above. Metabolites were quantified by comparison of peak areas with pure metabolite standards at known concentration. Metabolite flux studies from 13C-glutamine were performed as described previously21.  Detection of isocitrate, αKG, and 2HG in purified enzyme reactions by LC-MS  Enzyme reactions performed as described in the text were run to completion as judged by measurement of the oxidation state of NADPH at 340 nm. Reactions were extracted with eight volumes of methanol, and centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. The supernatant was dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in H2O. Analysis was conducted on an API2000 LC-MS-MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sample separation and analysis was performed on a 150 × 2 mm, 4 uM Synergi Hydro-RP 80 A column, using a gradient of Buffer A (10 mM tributylamine, 15 mM acetic acid, 3% (v/v) methanol, in water) and Buffer B (methanol) using MRM transitions.  Cell lysates based enzyme assays  293T cell lysates for measuring enzymatic activity were obtained 48 hours after transfection with M-PER lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000g, supernatants were collected and normalized for total protein concentration. To measure IDH oxidative activity, 3 μg of lysate protein was added to 200 μl of an assay solution containing 33 mM Tris-acetate buffer (pH 7.4), 1.3 mM MgCl2, 0.33 mM EDTA, 100 μM β-NADP, and varying concentrations of D-(+)-threo-isocitrate. Absorbance at 340 nm, reflecting NADPH production, was measured every 20 seconds for 30 min on a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), Data points represent the mean activity of 3 replicates per lysate, averaged among 5 time points centered at every 5 min. To measure IDH reductive activity, 3 μg of lysate protein was added to 200 μl of an assay solution which contained 33 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.4, 1.3 mM MgCl2,25 μM β-NADPH, 40 mM NaHCO3, and 0.6 mM αKG. The decrease in 340 nm absorbance over time was measured to assess NADPH consumption, with 3 replicates per lysate.  Recombinant IDH1 Enzyme Assays  All reactions were performed in standard enzyme reaction buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5,10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.03% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). For determination of kinetic parameters, sufficient enzyme was added to give a linear reaction for 1 to 5 seconds. Reaction progress was monitored by observation of the reduction state of the cofactor at 340 nm in an SFM-400 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (BioLogic, Knoxville, TN). Enzymatic constants were determined using curve fitting algorithms to standard kinetic models with the Sigmaplot software package (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).  Determination of chirality of reaction products from enzyme reactions and tumors  Enzyme reactions were run to completion and extracted with methanol as described above, then derivatized with enantiomerically pure tartaric acid before resolution and analysis by LC-MS. After being thoroughly dried, samples were resuspended in freshly prepared 50 mg/ml (2R,3R)-(+)-Tartaric acid in dichloromethane:acetic acid (4:1) and incubated for 30 minutes at 75°C. After cooling to room temperature, samples were briefly centrifuged at 14,000g, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and resuspended in H2O Analysis was conducted on an API200 LC-MS-MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using an isocratic flow of 90:10 (2 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.6:MeOH) on a Luna C18(2) 150 × 2 mm, 5 uM column. Tartaric-acid derivatized 2HG was detected using the 362.9/146.6 MRM transition and the following instrument settings: DP -1, FP -310, EP -4, CE-12, CXP-26. Analysis of the (R)-2HG standard, 2HG racemic mixture, and methanol-extracted tumor biomass (q.v.) was similarly performed. (R)-2HG standard was obtained from Sigma and synthesized internally.  Crystallography  For crystallography studies, purified R132H IDH1 was pre-incubated with NADPH, calcium chloride, and αKG. Crystals were obtained at 20°C by vapor diffusion equilibration of 3 μL drops of mixed 2:1 (protein:precipitant) against a well solution of MES pH 6.5 and PEG 6000. A diffraction dataset with 92% completeness was collected under cryo conditions with 1.08 Å wavelength radiation on an ADSC Quantum 315R detector at Beamline X29A of the NSLS at Brookhaven National Laboratories. The dataset was integrated using HKL2000 and scaled using SCALEPACK22. A single molecular replacement solution was obtained with PHASER23 using published coordinates from wild type IDH1 in the ‘closed’ conformation as search model (PDB accession code 1T0L). Model building was performed using COOT24 and the final model was refined by the CCP4 program REFMAC525; graphics were produced using PyMOL26. Water molecules were selectively modeled into the structure based upon strong spherical electron density difference peaks, having proper coordination geometry and distance, located within the first solvent shell layer, and having B-factors <80 and electron density sigma level >1.0. After the final refinement, 92.4% of residues fit in the most favored regions in the Ramachandran plot, with 6.8% in the additional allowed regions and 0.7% in general allowed regions. The final structure model in the closed form conformation at a resolution of 2.1 Å contains three polypeptide chains of IDH1R132H each chain consisting of 425 amino acids (414 residues plus a C-term His-tag, with residues 4–410 placed into the model), three NADPH molecules, and 301 total waters.  Clinical Specimens, metabolite extraction and analysis  The collection of human brain tumor samples was approved by the UCLA IRB. Human brain tumors were obtained during surgical resection, snap frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Clinical classification and grading of the tissue was performed using standard clinical histopathology as established by the WHO. Genomic sequence analysis was deployed to identify brain tumor samples containing either wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) or mutations altering amino acid 132. Genomic DNA was isolated from 50–100 mgs of brain tumor tissue using standard methods. A polymerase chain reaction on the isolated genomic DNA was used to amplify a 295 base pair fragment of the genomic DNA that contains both the intron and 2nd exon sequences of human IDH1 and mutation status assessed by standard molecular biology techniques.  Metabolite extraction was accomplished by adding a 10× volume (m/v ratio) of −80 C methanol:water mix (80%:20%) to the brain tissue (approximately 100mgs) followed by 30 s homogenization at 4 C. These chilled, methanol extracted homogenized tissues were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 minutes to sediment the cellular and tissue debris and the cleared tissue supernatants were transferred to a screw-cap freezer vial and stored at −80°C. For analysis, a 2× volume of tributylamine (10 mM) acetic acid (10 mM) pH 5.5 was added to the samples and analyzed by LCMS as follows. Sample extracts were filtered using a Millex-FG 0.20 micron disk and 10 μl were injected onto a reverse-phase HPLC column (Synergi 150mm × 2 mm, Phenomenex Inc.) and eluted using a linear gradient LC-MS-grade methanol (50%) with 10 mM tributylamine and 10 mM acetic acid) ramping to 80 % methanohl:10 mM tributylamine: 10 mM acetic acid over 6 minutes at 200 μL/min. Eluted metabolite ions were detected using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer, tuned to detect in negative mode with multiple-reaction-monitoring mode transition set according to the molecular weights and fragmentation patterns for 8 known central metabolites, including 2-hydroxyglutarate as described above. Data was processed using Analyst Software (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and metabolite signal intensities were obtained by standard peak integration methods.  
1755||Monoallelic point mutations in cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and its mitochondrial homolog IDH2 can lead to elevated levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in multiple cancers. Here we report that cellular 2HG production from cytosolic IDH1 mutation is dependent on the activity of a retained wild-type IDH1 allele. In contrast, expression of mitochondrial IDH2 mutations led to robust 2HG production in a manner independent of wild-type mitochondrial IDH function. Among the recurrent IDH2 mutations at Arg-172 and Arg-140, IDH2 Arg-172 mutations consistently led to greater 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-140 mutations, and the degree of 2HG accumulation correlated with the ability of these mutations to block cellular differentiation. Cytosolic IDH1 Arg-132 mutations, although structurally analogous to mutations at mitochondrial IDH2 Arg-172, were only able to elevate intracellular 2HG to comparable levels when an equivalent level of wild-type IDH1 was co-expressed. Consistent with 2HG production from cytosolic IDH1 being limited by substrate production from wild-type IDH1, we observed 2HG levels to increase in cancer cells harboring an endogenous monoallelic IDH1 mutation when mitochondrial IDH flux was diverted to the cytosol. Finally, expression of an IDH1 construct engineered to localize to the mitochondria rather than the cytosol resulted in greater 2HG accumulation. These data demonstrate that allelic and subcellular compartment differences can regulate the potential for IDH mutations to produce 2HG in cells. The consequences of 2HG elevation are dose-dependent, and the non-equivalent 2HG accumulation resulting from IDH1 and IDH2 mutations may underlie their differential prognosis and prevalence in various cancers.  Keywords: Cancer Biology, Cell Metabolism, Leukemia, Mitochondria, Tumor Metabolism Go to: Introduction Monoallelic point mutations in cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)3 were first discovered in exon sequencing studies of glioma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (1–3). All of the reported mutations were missense and at a single residue in the active site, Arg-132. These mutations were initially hypothesized to promote tumorigenesis through loss-of-function for the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate, coupled with dominant-negative activity against the retained wild-type allele (4). However, subsequent work found a novel gain-of-function for Arg-132 mutations in IDH1, as well as for structurally analogous mutations at Arg-172 of IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. This shared neomorphic enzymatic activity is the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(−)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) (5–7). Metabolite screening of AML samples revealed that 2HG-producing mutations can also occur at the non-orthologous Arg-140 residue of mitochondrial IDH2 (7). Collectively, 2HG-producing IDH1 Arg-132, IDH2 Arg-172, and IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are now known to be present in a large fraction of glioma, AML, chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarinoma, and T-cell angioimmunoblastic lymphoma samples, as well as isolated cases of colorectal and prostate cancer (3, 8–13). Additional 2HG-producing IDH mutations beyond those at IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172/Arg-140 exist, but appear to be very rare and do not include rare IDH mutations reported in thyroid cancer and melanoma nor common IDH single nucleotide polymorphisms (14).  Through production of the oncometabolite 2HG, IDH mutations have been proposed to have numerous pro-tumorigenic effects, most notably the competitive inhibition of α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzymes that modify chromatin (15–19). These effects have been associated with a block in cell differentiation. Although Arg-132 mutations in cytosolic IDH1, the analogous Arg-172 mutations in mitochondrial IDH2, and the non-analogous IDH2 Arg-140 mutations all demonstrate the ability to elevate 2HG oncometabolite levels, it is becoming increasingly clear that these mutations are not functionally equivalent. The best evidence to date for this concept may be found in AML, where a better prognosis for patients with IDH2 Arg-140 mutations versus those with IDH2 Arg-172 mutations or IDH1 Arg-132 mutations has been reported by multiple groups (20–22). IDH2 Arg-140 mutations have yet to be described in glioma, chondrosarcoma, or cholangiocarinoma, despite the established prevalence of both IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172 mutations in these cancers. In contrast, IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are the only IDH mutations found in the inborn error of metabolism d-2HG aciduria (23). The importance of subcellular localization differences between IDH1 and IDH2 proteins has also remained unexplored.  In this study, we have determined that there are distinct differences between the various 2HG-producing IDH1 and IDH2 mutations; both upstream regarding the metabolic pathways required to support 2HG production, and downstream regarding the cellular consequences of 2HG accumulation. The extent of 2HG production from mitochondrial IDH2 mutations depends on the particular site that is mutated. IDH2 Arg-140 mutations result in less cellular 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations under a variety of experimental conditions, correlating with the weaker ability of Arg-140 mutations to impair cell differentiation relative to Arg-172 mutations. Surprisingly, mutations in cytosolic IDH1 Arg-132, structurally analogous to mutations in mitochondrial IDH2 Arg-172, do not produce as much 2HG when overexpressed in cells at comparable levels. To a much greater extent than mitochondrial IDH2 mutations, cytosolic IDH1 mutations are substrate-limited for 2HG production in cells. Cellular 2HG accumulation from mutant IDH1 can be enhanced by co-expression of wild-type IDH1, diversion of wild-type IDH flux from mitochondria to cytosol, or forced re-localization of mutant IDH1 from cytosol to mitochondria. These results identify dose-dependent consequences of cellular 2HG accumulation and demonstrate that both allelic differences and the subcellular compartmentalization of metabolic flux can affect the ability of IDH mutations to result in cellular 2HG accumulation.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture and Reagents 293T cells, 3T3-L1 cells, JJ012 chondrosarcoma cells (24), and CS-1 chondrosarcoma cells (25) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (CellGro). JJ012 cells have a monoallelic endogenous IDH1 R132G mutation that has previously been reported (26), which we confirmed by Sequenom assay. CS-1 cells have a monoallelic endogenous IDH2 R172S mutation, which we determined by Sequenom assay. IDH mutation analysis in this cell line has not been previously reported. 3T3-L1 cells with stable expression of wild-type or mutant IDH2 were generated as described previously (17).  Cell Differentiation, Oil Red O Staining, Quantitative Real-time PCR 3T3-L1 cell differentiation, Oil Red O staining, and quantitative real-time PCR were performed as previously described (17). Experiments on primary murine bone marrow were performed according to previously published methods (16).  Protein Harvest and Quantitation and Western Blot Cells were lysed 48 h following transfection with RIPA buffer or mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 2 and 3 (Sigma). Lysates were sonicated with 2 × 30-s pulses using the high setting on a Bioruptor300 (Diagenode) and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were subsequently collected and assessed for protein concentration with BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). α-Ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption assays from cell lysates were performed as previously described (7). For cellular fractionation experiments, cells were lysed in isotonic buffer containing 200 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were homogenized with 60 strikes in a Dounce homogenizer and then centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. This supernatant was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet from this centrifugation was resuspended in RIPA buffer + protease inhibitor mixture and used as the heavy membrane fraction, whereas the supernatant layer was collected as the non-heavy membrane fraction. For Western blotting, lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE on Novex 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. Primary antibodies used were: anti-IDH1 (Santa Cruz sc-49996, 1:200 dilution), anti-IDH2 (Abcam ab55271, 1:500), anti-IDH3A (Abcam ab58641, 1:750), anti-ACO2 (Cell Signaling 6922, 1:1,000), anti-FLAG (Sigma F1804, 1:250), anti-Myc tag (Millipore 05–419, 1:1,000), anti-VDAC (Cell Signaling 4661S, 1:2,000), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma T6199, 1:10,000), and anti-S6 (Cell Signaling 2317 or 2217, 1:1,000). Detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat antibodies (GE Healthcare NA934V, GE Healthcare NA931V, and Santa Cruz sc-2020; all 1:10,000 dilution).  Metabolite Extraction Following gentle removal of culture medium from proliferating cells, cells were rapidly quenched with 80% methanol pre-chilled to −80 °C and containing a M+5 internal standard of R(−)-2HG containing five deuterium atoms (d-2-hydroxyglutaric-2,3,3,4,4-d5 acid; details for synthesis can be found in supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). Following incubation at −80 °C for at least 30 min, cell extracts were collected, sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated protein. Supernatants were next dried under nitrogen gas, redissolved in 1:1 acetonitrile: N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (Regis, Morton Grove, IL), and heated at 70 °C for 80 min to derivatize metabolites. t-Butyl dimethyl silyl derivatives of organic acids were then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as previously described (7, 27). 2HG levels were obtained by quantifying the peak area of the ion at m/z 433, formed through the loss of a t-butyl group (−57 atomic mass units) from the molecular ion tri-t-butyl dimethyl silyl-2HG, and normalizing to the peak area of the m/z 438 ion (representing the analogous derivative of the d5-2HG internal standard spiked at known concentration) and the total cellular protein as measured by BCA.  Plasmid Construction and Transfection The cDNA clone of human IDH1 (BC012846.1) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection, and human IDH2 (BC009244) from Invitrogen. IDH1 R132H, IDH2 R172K, and IDH2 R140Q point mutations were generated as previously described (17). FLAG or Myc tags were added to the C termini of the open reading frames by standard PCR techniques. To introduce siRNA resistance, silent point mutations were generated as follows by site-directed mutagenesis: for IDH1, the cDNA sequence 5′-gt cac tac cgc atg tac ca-3′ was changed to 5′-gt cat tat agg atg tat ca-3′ (alterations underlined) to confer resistance to the human IDH1 siRNA with sense sequence 5′-gu cac uac cgc aug uac ca-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs01_00340497). For IDH2, the cDNA sequence 5′-gt gat gag atg acc cgt at-3′ was changed to 5′-gc gac gaa aca agg at-3′ to confer resistance to the human IDH2 siRNA with sense sequence 5′-gu gau gag aug acc cgu au-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs01_00151612). These changes are not predicted to alter the sequence of the translated IDH1/2 proteins. To generate the IDH1 construct that localizes to mitochondria, the cDNA sequence encoding the predicted N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of IDH2 plus 10 subsequent amino acids was amplified using primers 5′-tgt caa ggt tta ttg aag tca aaa tgg ccg gct acc tgc ggg t-3′ and 5′-tct cct tgc atc tct acc acg ggc ttc gcc acc ttg atc c-3′. The resulting PCR product was purified and subsequently used as a “super primer” in a standard QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis reaction (28) using the IDH1 cDNA as template (with the underlined segments of the above listed primers providing the necessary complementarity to the IDH1 cDNA for the super primer). The mutagenesis reaction was then transformed into TOP10 cells (Invitrogen) and clones were identified that had incorporated the desired N-terminal MTS and subsequent 10 residues of IDH2 in place of the first 9 residues of IDH1. A similar N-terminal IDH domain swapping strategy has previously been shown to be effective with yeast IDH enzymes (29). Integrity of constructs was confirmed by direct sequencing prior to transfection into 293T cells in pCMV-Sport6 or pCDNA3 expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions.  siRNA For siRNA experiments in JJ012 and CS-1 cells, cells were reverse transfected with Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen) using 30 pmol of siRNA (final concentration of 10 nm) per 1.5 × 105 cells/well of 6-well plates. For plasmid and siRNA co-transfection experiments in 293T cells, forward transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 using 50–60 pmol of siRNA (final concentration of 25–30 nm) per 7–8 × 105 cells/well of 6-well plates. In addition to the IDH1 and IDH2 siRNAs described above, additional siRNAs used were: universal negative control from Sigma-Proligo (SIC001), IDH1 5′-cugucuaaggguuggccuu-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs01_00023490), IDH2 5′-caagucuucggguggcuuu-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs02_00333382), IDH3A 5′-caggcaaggacauggcgaa-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs02_00339757), ACO2 5′-cauccauuaugaccugcu-3′ and 5′-cauuaacauuguucgcaa-3′ from Ambion (Silencer Select 4390824, s921 and s922). All listed sequences are for the sense strand.  Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed with Student's t test. To analyze experiments comparing 2HG accumulation in pairs of transfectants over a range of IDH expression levels, a paired samples Student's t test was used.  Go to: RESULTS Extent of 2HG Production from Mitochondrial IDH2 Mutations Depends on the Affected Residue but Not on Wild-type IDH Activity Arg-172 mutations in mitochondrial IDH2 are found in glioma, chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and lymphoma, and are associated with a poor prognosis in AML. In contrast, Arg-140 mutations are not found in glioma, chondrosarcoma, and cholangiocarcinoma, and are associated with a better prognosis in AML. We hypothesized that these differences could be accounted for, in part, by quantitative differences in the extent of cellular 2HG accumulation resulting from Arg-140 versus Arg-172 mutations. To test this hypothesis, we compared the most common IDH2 mutations R140Q and R172K for their ability to produce 2HG at various levels of expression in cells lacking endogenous IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. Increasing expression of both mutants led to increasing amounts of 2HG (Fig. 1A). However, R172K mutant IDH2 expression consistently resulted in more 2HG accumulation than R140Q mutant expression (p < 0.005).  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Mitochondrial IDH2 Arg-140 mutations result in less cellular 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations, and 2HG accumulation from both mutations is insensitive to depletion of wild-type IDH. A, FLAG-tagged IDH2 R140Q and R172K cDNA constructs, or empty ... In most reported cases, both Arg-140 and Arg-172 mutations in IDH2 occur at only one allele, with retention of one wild-type IDH2 copy in tumors. Wild-type IDH2 can potentially produce both mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate and NADPH, the substrates for the neomorphic activity of mutant IDH2. To address whether differential dependence on wild-type IDH2 function could account for the differences in 2HG production we observed between Arg-140 and Arg-172 mutations, we expressed siRNA-resistant versions of the IDH2 R140Q and R172K mutants with or without simultaneous siRNA knockdown of the endogenous wild-type IDH2. The ability of both mutations to result in 2HG accumulation was insensitive to knockdown of the endogenous wild-type IDH2 (Fig. 1B). To address whether IDH3, which produces mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate and NADH, could compensate for the loss of wild-type IDH2, we expressed siRNA-resistant versions of IDH2 R140Q or R172K with simultaneous knockdown of either IDH3 alone or IDH3 together with endogenous wild-type IDH2 (Fig. 1C). Neither IDH3 knockdown alone nor the combined knockdown of endogenous wild-type IDH2 and IDH3 decreased cellular 2HG accumulation from IDH2 R140Q or R172K mutant expression. Directly upstream of the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate by wild-type mitochondrial IDH2 and IDH3 is the mitochondrial aconitase ACO2, which isomerizes mitochondrial citrate to isocitrate. In a chondrosarcoma cell line with a naturally occurring, endogenous, monoallelic IDH2 R172S mutation, we examined the effect of impairing the pathway of mitochondrial citrate to α-ketoglutarate conversion. As expected, siRNA against IDH2 in this cell line, targeting both the mutant and wild-type IDH2, resulted in a sharp decrease in 2HG accumulation from mutant IDH2. However, knockdown of ACO2 did not impair 2HG accumulation, providing further evidence that the ability to convert citrate to isocitrate and then α-ketoglutarate in the mitochondria is not critical for the production of 2HG by mitochondrial IDH2 mutations (Fig. 1D). siRNA knockdown of either IDH3 or IDH1 was also unable to markedly impair 2HG accumulation in these cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that IDH2 Arg-140 mutations consistently result in less 2HG accumulation in cells than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations, and that 2HG production by IDH2 mutations is unaffected by impaired production of α-ketoglutarate from mitochondrial citrate in multiple cell types.  Differential 2HG Production by IDH2 Arg-140 and Arg-172 Mutations Has Consequences for Gene Expression and Cell Differentiation Recent work has highlighted the ability of 2HG to inhibit multiple α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzymes and impair growth factor/cytokine-induced gene expression and the ability of cells to differentiate. Previously we have reported that stable expression of an R172K IDH2 mutant in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes can impair their ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes following exposure to a well established differentiation mixture and this effect can be mimicked by adding cell penetrant forms of 2HG to the medium (17). To extend this observation, 3T3-L1 cells expressing either the R140Q or R172K mutant of IDH2 were compared. Although IDH2 R140Q expressing 3T3-L1 cells were impaired in their ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes, the extent of differentiation blockade was consistently less than that observed with IDH2 R172K expressing cells (Fig. 2, A-C). IDH2 R140Q expressing cells showed a more modest block in the ability to accumulate intracellular lipid as assessed by Oil Red O staining, and also demonstrated less silencing of the expression of the fat cell differentiation genes Glut4, FABP4, Adiponectin, and PPARγ than IDH2 R172K expressing cells. These effects correlated with the R140Q expressing cells accumulating 2HG to ∼⅓ of the level found in the R172K expressing cells (Fig. 2D). These findings demonstrate that IDH2 Arg-140 mutations can result in less 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations in non-transformed cells, and suggest that dosage differences in 2HG accumulation can account for the different cellular effects of IDH2 Arg-140 versus Arg-172 mutations.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. Extent of 2HG accumulation correlates with the degree of differentiation blockade in non-transformed cells expressing IDH2 Arg-140 or Arg-172 mutations. A, Western blot of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes stably expressing additional IDH2 WT, IDH2 R172K, IDH2 R140Q, ... Although we have utilized 3T3-L1 cells as a general model system for cell differentiation, reflecting the occurrence of IDH mutations in a wide variety of cancers and in metabolic disorders, we have also specifically examined the differential effects of IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R172K in a hematopoietic cell model relevant to AML. We have previously reported that expression of IDH2 R140Q can increase the expression of the progenitor cell marker c-kit (stem cell factor receptor) in murine primary bone marrow cells (16). We report here an extension of this analysis to compare the relative abilities of IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R172K to increase c-kit expression. Following 5 days of liquid culture in myeloid growth conditions, a higher percentage of c-kit expressing cells was observed in bone marrow expressing IDH2 R172K than in bone marrow expressing IDH2 R140Q (supplemental Fig. S1). These data provide further evidence that IDH2 Arg-172 and Arg-140 mutations can result in distinct degrees of cell differentiation impairment.  2HG Production from Cytosolic IDH1 Mutation in Cells Is Dependent on Retained Wild-type IDH1 Expression With no exceptions reported to date, 2HG-producing mutations at Arg-132 of cytosolic IDH1 are monoallelic, with retention of the wild-type IDH1 allele. Arg-132 of cytosolic IDH1 is the analogous residue to Arg-172 of mitochondrial IDH2 (Fig. 3A). Both IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172 play similar roles for substrate stability in the enzyme active site. To directly compare the cellular 2HG accumulation of cytosolic IDH1 Arg-132 mutations versus mitochondrial IDH2 mutations, we expressed a FLAG-tagged version of the most common IDH1 mutation, R132H, as well as both IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R172K. Surprisingly, IDH1 R132H expression did not result in as much 2HG accumulation as expression of IDH2 R172K (Fig. 3B). The inability of IDH1 R132H expression to result in as much 2HG accumulation as IDH2 R172K expression was observed across a range in mutant IDH expression (Fig. 3C). However, when additional wild-type IDH1 was co-overexpressed, 2HG accumulation was reproducibly increased in cells expressing various levels of R132H mutant IDH1 (p < 0.05). With simultaneous transfection of exogenous wild-type and mutant IDH1, predicted to maximize the formation of wild-type:mutant IDH1 heterodimers, cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 demonstrated comparable 2HG accumulation to cells expressing IDH2 R172K, and both IDH1 R132H and IDH2 R172K cells had greater 2HG levels than cells expressing IDH2 R140Q (Fig. 3C). The ability of co-overexpression of wild-type IDH1 to enhance cellular 2HG production from the R132H mutant IDH1 was also observed with untagged constructs, as well as different combinations of FLAG and Myc-tagged versions of IDH1 (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). However, co-transfection of an IDH1 A134D mutant previously reported to be catalytically inactive (14) did not result in comparable augmentation of 2HG accumulation in IDH1 R132H-transfected cells (supplemental Fig. S2C).  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Cellular 2HG accumulation from cytosolic IDH1 mutation depends on maintained expression of wild-type IDH1. A, depiction of the open reading frames of the homologous proteins cytosolic IDH1 and mitochondrial IDH2. Recurrently mutated amino acid residues ... To examine if depletion of endogenous wild-type IDH1 could impair 2HG production from mutant IDH1, we constructed a tagged version of IDH1 R132H engineered to be siRNA resistant, and co-transfected it along with siRNA against endogenous wild-type IDH1 (siIDH1). Although we reproducibly observed ∼2-fold higher expression of Myc-tagged IDH1 R132H when endogenous wild-type IDH1 levels were decreased, 2HG accumulation did not double but instead decreased by 50% (Fig. 3D). To confirm that this reduction in 2HG accumulation was due to the depletion of wild-type IDH1 and not an off-target siRNA effect, we co-transfected FLAG-tagged IDH1 WT that was also engineered to be siRNA resistant along with the siRNA-resistant Myc-tagged IDH1 R132H. With co-expression of IDH1 WT-FLAG along with IDH1 R132H-Myc, there was a 3-fold increase in 2HG production that was not diminished by endogenous wild-type IDH1 depletion with siIDH1 transfection. Cell proliferation was confirmed to be comparable under all of these transfection conditions (supplemental Fig. S2D). These results demonstrate that retention of wild-type IDH1 expression is critical for 2HG production from mutant IDH1 in the cytosol.  Impairing Mitochondrial IDH Flux Increases 2HG Production from Mutant IDH1 in the Cytosol To examine whether increasing substrate flux through the existing wild-type IDH1 can enhance the ability of mutant IDH1 to produce 2HG in the cytosol, we examined the effect of impairing mitochondrial IDH activity in JJ012 chondrosarcoma cells harboring a naturally occurring, endogenous, monoallelic IDH1 R132G mutation. Depleting mitochondrial IDH2 or IDH3 can result in the diversion of citrate and/or isocitrate to the cytosol thus increasing substrate availability for wild-type IDH1 (Fig. 4A). As expected, transfection of siRNA targeting both wild-type and mutant IDH1 (siIDH1) impaired the ability of these cells to accumulate 2HG (Fig. 4B). However, depletion of either mitochondrial IDH2 or IDH3 increased 2HG accumulation in these cells harboring a monoallelic IDH1 mutation. Depletion of mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2) with two independent siRNAs also led to a reproducible increase in 2HG accumulation. These results provide further evidence that the ability of mutant IDH1 to produce 2HG is limited by the local supply of substrate, which can be increased by enhancing the isocitrate → α-ketoglutarate flux and cytosolic NADPH production through wild-type IDH1.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. Impairing mitochondrial IDH flux results in increased 2HG accumulation in cells with endogenous cytosolic IDH1 mutation. A, model for metabolism in a cell harboring a monoallelic IDH1 mutation. B, JJ012 chondrosarcoma cells with a naturally occurring, ... Mitochondrial Localization of Cytosolic IDH1 Mutation Results in Greater 2HG Accumulation Collectively, the above results suggest that cytosolic IDH1 mutants are more limited in their supply of substrate for 2HG production than mitochondrial IDH2 mutants. To confirm that the differing substrate supply dependence between IDH1 and IDH2 mutants in cells is due to their subcellular localization differences, we generated an IDH1 construct that incorporated the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of IDH2 (Fig. 5A). We confirmed that this “mito-IDH1” construct localized to the cellular heavy membrane fraction containing mitochondria, like mitochondrial IDH2 and unlike cytosolic IDH1 lacking the MTS (Fig. 5B). The tagged versions of IDH1 R132H and mito-IDH R132H were then transfected over a 40-fold range. We determined that cell lysates with equivalent expression levels of the mitochondrial and cytosolic localized IDH1 R132H proteins demonstrated equivalent α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption rates when α-ketoglutarate and NAPH were provided in excess in vitro following cell lysis (data not shown). However, when assessing 2HG accumulation in cells with a range of expression levels of cytosolic IDH1 R132H or mito-IDH1 R132H, mito-IDH1 R132H-expressing cells consistently demonstrated greater 2HG accumulation than cells expressing comparable levels of cytosolic IDH1 R132H (p < 0.01, Fig. 5C). We performed another experiment to assess 2HG accumulation in cells expressing IDH1 R132H in the cytosol or mitochondria relative to cells expressing IDH2 R172K with its normal mitochondrial localization sequence intact. At comparable expression levels, both IDH2 R172K and mito-IDH1 R132H expressing cells had greater 2HG accumulation than cells expressing IDH1 R132H localized to the cytosol (Fig. 5D). Collectively, these data demonstrate that localization of IDH mutants to mitochondria rather than the cytosol results in greater 2HG accumulation in cells.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Mitochondrial localization of cytosolic IDH1 mutant results in greater accumulation of 2HG in cells. A, An IDH1 construct designed to mislocalize to the mitochondria was engineered by placing the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of IDH2 at the N ... Go to: DISCUSSION The common feature of recurrent cancer-associated mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes is a neomorphic enzymatic activity converting α-ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite 2HG. In many functional studies to date, the various 2HG-producing IDH1/2 mutations have been considered equivalent. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that distinct neomorphic IDH1/2 alleles are not found with equal frequencies across different cancers and are not associated with the same prognosis (supplemental Table S1). For example, IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are rarely found in cancer outside of myeloid malignancies. But within myeloid malignancies, IDH2 Arg-140 is the most commonly mutated IDH residue in AML, and is uniquely associated with a better AML prognosis relative to IDH2 Arg-172 and IDH1 Arg-132 mutations (20–22). Moreover, little work has addressed the importance of differential subcellular localization of the IDH1 and IDH2 proteins.  The data presented here demonstrate that the particular residue that is mutated within the IDH active site has consequences for both the amount of 2HG that accumulates and the cellular consequences of IDH mutation. Both Arg-140 and Arg-172 mutations in mitochondrial IDH2 can produce increasing amounts of 2HG at increasing cellular expression levels, and both are insensitive to impairment of wild-type IDH activity. However, across multiple expression conditions and cell types, IDH2 Arg-140 mutations consistently result in less 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations. A recent report documenting similar differences when these mutations were knocked-in to an endogenous IDH2 allele in colon cancer cells via homologous recombination provides further support for this finding (30). Here, we demonstrate that the quantitative difference in 2HG accumulation between IDH2 Arg-140 and Arg-172 mutations is within a range that can variably alter gene expression in non-transformed cells and the ability of these lineage-specific progenitor cells to differentiate into terminally differentiated cells. In addition to cancer, these data are relevant to the inborn error of metabolism d-2HG aciduria. In this disease marked by widespread 2HG elevation in cells and body fluids, nearly 50% of cases harbor IDH2 Arg-140 mutations, but other IDH mutations are not found. We propose that only the lower 2HG levels resulting from IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are compatible with embryogenesis and that higher 2HG levels resulting from other germline IDH mutations may be lethal in utero.  It remains possible that the major downstream effects of 2HG that are critical to transformation vary between different cancers. 2HG can inhibit the catalytic activity of TET2, a DNA 5-methylcytosine hydroxylase. In AML, the mutual exclusivity of IDH mutations with TET2 mutations (16), as well as the emerging phenotypes of TET2 knock-out mice (31–33), provides evidence that inhibition of TET2 function can be a critical event sufficient to promote hematologic malignancy. In contrast, other cancers like glioma harbor IDH mutations but not TET2 mutations. We have proposed that in glioma, concerted inhibition of Jumonji histone demethylases by 2HG may assume an important tumorigenic role that cannot be recapitulated by simply inhibiting TET2 (17). 2HG can also inhibit prolyl hydroxylases that modify collagen (19, 34), which are likely to be of more importance in solid tumors such as glioma and chondrosarcoma than in liquid tumors like AML. Sustained inhibition of histone demethylases and/or collagen modifying enzymes may require higher levels of 2HG than that required for effective inhibition of TET2 function in myeloid cells. This requirement may account for why the lower 2HG-producing IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are not found in solid tumors. Further studies, including those with genetically engineered mice expressing the various IDH mutations in different cell lineages, will be required to test this hypothesis.  Left unexplored in the literature to date is examination of the impact that differential subcellular localization of IDH1 and IDH2 mutant proteins has on the ability of these mutants to result in 2HG accumulation in cells. IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172 are structurally analogous residues and play similar roles in substrate binding in the enzyme active site, yet expression of IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172 mutations in cells at comparable levels did not result in equivalent levels of 2HG accumulation unless wild-type IDH1 was co-expressed. This result is unlikely to be due solely to intrinsically weaker enzymatic activity of IDH1 R132H relative to IDH2 R172K for producing 2HG, because mitochondrial targeting of IDH1 R132H also resulted in increased 2HG accumulation relative to IDH1 R132H in the cytosol. The results presented here suggest that unlike the case with mitochondrial IDH2 mutations, 2HG production from cytosolic IDH1 mutations is particularly dependent on metabolic flux through a wild-type IDH1 partner to increase the local availability of substrate.  Although both mitochondrial IDH2 and cytosolic IDH1 mutations predominantly occur in monoallelic fashion, cases with reduction to homozygosity of mutant IDH2 have been reported (26, 35), whereas loss of the wild-type IDH1 allele in an IDH1 mutant cancer has not been described to date. We have previously proposed that more efficient generation of 2HG with co-expression of WT and mutant IDH1 may exist (5). One possible explanation for this, that the WT:R132H heterodimer could have intrinsically better activity to directly reduce α-ketoglutarate to 2HG, is not supported by the recent data of Leonardi et al. (36) who shows that the recombinant WT:R132H heterodimer is not as efficient as the R132H:R132H homodimer at converting α-ketoglutarate to 2HG in vitro. Although Pietrak et al. (37) concluded that the potential for substrate channeling from isocitrate → α-ketoglutarate → 2HG through WT:R132H heterodimers is present, they also concluded that the WT subunit was not necessary for the production of 2HG by the mutant recombinant protein. This finding was arrived at when α-ketoglutarate and NADPH were supplied in excess in vitro. But particularly in light of other reports suggesting that 2HG in cells is directly produced from the pathway of glutamine → glutamate → α-ketoglutarate → 2HG (5, 38), it has remained unclear how retained expression of wild-type IDH1 could be important for 2HG production by mutant IDH1.  In contrast to these biochemical studies of purified proteins, the present data suggest that in intact cells, cytosolic mutant IDH1 is substrate limited and that wild-type IDH1 contributes to the local substrate production required for mutant IDH1 to produce 2HG. This finding adds to the growing evidence that IDH1 mutations do not act via dominant inhibition of wild-type IDH1. By contrast, our findings suggest that targeting the provision of substrate by wild-type IDH1 to mutant IDH1 may provide an additional mechanism to mitigate the ultimate effects of IDH mutations by reducing the ability to produce 2HG. This would be especially attractive if increased flux through wild-type IDH1 can be shown to be dependent on the activation of growth factor signaling pathways. Prior evidence has linked IDH1 expression levels to the activity of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein transcription factor (39). Increasing IDH1 expression has been suggested to alter cellular and organismal physiology by increasing the production of cytosolic NADPH (40). Further studies in non-transformed cell lines will be needed to test the dependence of 2HG production from cytosolic mutant IDH1 on the prior induction of growth factor signaling and increased wild-type IDH1 activity. But this hypothesis may partially explain the failure (to date) of genetically engineered mouse models to demonstrate the initiation of tumorigenesis by IDH1 mutation in a stem/progenitor cell (34, 41, 42). It appears from the present data that 2HG production from cytosolic mutant IDH1 is a dynamic process that is acutely sensitive to the background metabolic state of the cell.  In contrast to 2HG production from mutant IDH1 being dependent on wild-type IDH1, these data show that 2HG production from mutant IDH2 is not dependent on wild-type mitochondrial IDH2 (or IDH3) activity. This is consistent with the report that IDH2 mutants do not heterodimerize with IDH2 WT, unlike IDH1 R132H mutants that do heterodimerize with a wild-type partner (43). It remains a technical challenge in the field to reliably measure metabolite levels in the subcellular compartments of intact cells. Our study does not determine the percentages of α-ketoglutarate and NADPH within each subcellular compartment that are dependent on wild-type IDH activity and/or the metabolism of anaplerotic substrates like glutamine. However, the lack of dependence of 2HG production from mitochondrial IDH2 mutations on wild-type IDH activity is consistent with mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate levels being maintained by a variety of anaplerotic substrates, and with a high NADPH/NADP+ ratio being maintained in the mitochondria through the interconversion of NADH to NADPH by the mitochondrial trans-hydrogenase (44). Recent work from multiple groups has implicated wild-type IDH “reverse flux,” the NADPH-dependent reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate back to isocitrate, as playing an important role for cell growth and viability, particularly in hypoxic conditions or in cells with impaired TCA cycle function (27, 45–47). Although there is debate regarding whether this reductive carboxylation is primarily dependent upon cytosolic IDH1 or mitochondrial IDH2, the metabolic conditions that favor 2HG production from IDH mutations are also likely to favor reductive carboxylation flux from wild-type IDH proteins. The present results suggest that relative to the cytosol, mitochondria provide a more consistently favorable environment for the reductive metabolism of glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate.  Mutations in metabolic enzymes, including isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2, in cancer strongly implicate altered metabolism in tumorigenesis. IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze the interconversion of isocitrate and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). 2OG is a TCA cycle intermediate and an essential cofactor for many enzymes, including JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases, TET 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases, and EglN prolyl-4-hydroxylases. Cancer-associated IDH mutations alter the enzymes such that they reduce 2OG to the structurally similar metabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2HG]. Here we review what is known about the molecular mechanisms of transformation by mutant IDH and discuss their implications for the development of targeted therapies to treat IDH mutant malignancies.  Keywords: 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, cancer metabolism, chondrosarcoma, glioma, isocitrate dehydrogenase, leukemia Cellular metabolism has been hypothesized to play a central role in cancer since the observation made almost a century ago by Otto Warburg (Warburg 1956) that cancer cells preferentially generate energy by metabolizing glucose to lactate. Even in the presence of oxygen, cancer cells switch from generating ATP by the highly energy-efficient process of oxidative phosphorylation to the much less efficient process of glycolysis (Vander Heiden et al. 2009; Dang 2012). Why this switch occurs has long been a mystery, although the observation that normal cells use “aerobic glycolysis” during periods of increased proliferation supports the hypothesis that this metabolic switch is an important feature of rapidly dividing cells (Locasale and Cantley 2011; Lunt and Vander Heiden 2011). Recent work suggests that aerobic glycolysis facilitates cellular transformation by producing the high levels of glycolytic intermediates that proliferating cells need for the biosynthesis of lipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids. Moreover, metabolic reprogramming appears to be sufficient to mediate tumorigenesis in some systems (Lyssiotis and Cantley 2012; Sebastian et al. 2012). Nevertheless, whether altered cellular metabolism is a cause of cancer or merely an adaptive response of cancer cells in the face of accelerated cell proliferation is still a topic of some debate.  The recent identification of cancer-associated mutations in three metabolic enzymes suggests that altered cellular metabolism can indeed be a cause of some cancers (Pollard et al. 2003; King et al. 2006; Raimundo et al. 2011). Two of these enzymes, fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), are bone fide tumor suppressors, and loss-of-function mutations in FH and SDH have been identified in various cancers, including renal cell carcinomas and paragangliomas. The third mutated enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), is a more complicated case. Mutations in two isoforms of IDH, IDH1 and IDH2, are common in a diverse array of cancers, including gliomas and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (Dang et al. 2010). The mutant enzymes are not catalytically inactive. Rather, the cancer-associated mutations alter the catalytic activity of the enzymes such that they produce high levels of a metabolite, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2HG], which is normally found at very low levels in cells (Dang et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2010). How this aberrant enzymatic activity contributes to cellular transformation is an area of intense interest and some controversy, and several hypotheses have been proposed for how IDH mutations promote tumorigenesis. It has been suggested that (R)-2HG functions as an “oncometabolite” to promote cellular transformation, perhaps by altering the redox state of cells or modulating the activity of metabolic and epigenetic tumor suppressor enzymes that use the structurally similar metabolite α-ketoglutarate as a cosubstrate (Reitman and Yan 2010; Yen et al. 2010; Kaelin 2011). Others have posited that loss of IDH activity from either loss of the wild-type allele or gain of a dominant-negative mutant allele alters normal mitochondrial function and promotes the metabolic switch of cancer cells to glycolysis (Leonardi et al. 2012; Oermann et al. 2012).  Here, we review the spectrum of tumors that harbor IDH mutations and discuss what has been learned to date about how mutant IDH and (R)-2HG contribute to tumorigenesis. We also discuss the potential of mutant IDH as a therapeutic target in cancer and discuss some of the outstanding questions about mutant IDH biology that warrant further investigation.  Go to: Normal functions of the IDH family of metabolic enzymes Eukaryotic cells express three different isoforms of IDH (Fig. 1; Dalziel 1980). IDH1 and IDH2 are homodimeric NADP+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to produce α-ketoglutarate (also known as 2-oxoglutarate [2OG]), NADPH, and CO2 (Fig. 2). IDH3 is a structurally unrelated heterotetrameric NAD+-dependent enzyme that similarly decarboxylates isocitrate and produces 2OG, NADH, and CO2. The reactions catalyzed by IDH1 and IDH2 are reversible, and the directionality of the reactions therefore depends in large part on the relative Km values of the forward and reverse reactions and the relative levels of isocitrate and 2OG in the cell (Lemons et al. 2010). The reaction catalyzed by IDH3, on the other hand, is irreversible under physiologic conditions and is principally regulated by substrate availability and positive and negative allosteric effectors. Calcium, ADP, and citrate activate IDH3, whereas ATP, NADH, and NADPH inhibit this enzyme (Gabriel et al. 1986).  Figure 1. Figure 1. The role of the IDH family of enzymes in the TCA cycle. Shown here are the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic reactions that involve IDH; also shown are the principal mechanisms of entry of glucose and glutamine-derived carbon molecules into the TCA cycle. ... Figure 2. Figure 2. Reactions catalyzed by wild-type and mutant IDH1 and IDH2. Wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze a two-step reaction (indicated by blue arrows). The first step involves the oxidation of isocitrate to the unstable intermediate oxalosuccinate. In this reaction, ... The different IDH isoforms have overlapping, but nonredundant, roles in cellular metabolism (Fig. 1; Mailloux et al. 2007; Reitman and Yan 2010). IDH1 localizes to the cytoplasm and peroxisomes and plays a role in promoting the activity of the numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear dioxygenases that require 2OG as a cosubstrate (Hausinger 2004). Another important function of IDH1 is the generation of nonmitochondrial NADPH. NADPH provides critical reducing equivalents needed for lipid biosynthesis and is also an essential antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress and radiation damage (Jo et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2007). Finally, as the reaction catalyzed by IDH1 is reversible, IDH1 is capable of catalyzing the reductive carboxylation of 2OG to isocitrate, which can then be further metabolized to acetyl-CoA to support lipid biosynthesis (Koh et al. 2004; Filipp et al. 2012; Metallo et al. 2012).  IDH2 and IDH3, in contrast, localize to the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 1). IDH3 plays a central role in mitochondrial respiration by catalyzing one of the rate-limiting steps of the TCA cycle. The 2OG produced by IDH3 is further metabolized to succinate, and the NADH is used by the electron transport chain to generate ATP (Barnes et al. 1971). It is not clear whether IDH2 likewise contributes to flux through the TCA cycle. Rather, IDH2 is thought to regulate energy metabolism by modulating the relative abundance of isocitrate and 2OG in the mitochondria (DeBerardinis et al. 2008). Under conditions where levels of mitochondrial glutamate are high or under hypoxic conditions when glucose-dependent citrate production is compromised, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) converts glutamate to 2OG (Sazanov and Jackson 1994; Comte et al. 2002). The resultant increase in the 2OG:isocitrate ratio favors the reverse IDH2 reaction, which results in conversion of 2OG and NADPH to isocitrate and NADP+. This isocitrate can then be fed into the TCA cycle by IDH3, which converts the isocitrate back to 2OG and produces additional NADH, or isomerized by aconitase to produce citrate. Citrate, in addition to being a TCA cycle intermediate, is a critical metabolite required for fatty acid biosynthesis. Accordingly, IDH2-mediated reductive carboxylation of 2OG plays an important role in sustaining energy production and promoting cell proliferation during periods of hypoxia (Wise et al. 2011; Filipp et al. 2012). IDH2, as an important source of mitochondrial NADPH, also plays a critical role in the protection of cells from mitochondrial-specific oxidative stress, such as that generated by the electron transport chain (Lee et al. 2004, 2007).  Go to: IDH mutations in human cancer Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly invasive brain tumor that is notoriously refractory to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In 2008, in an effort to identify novel therapeutic targets in GBM, Parsons et al. (2008) undertook a landmark genomic sequencing effort of 22 adult primary and secondary GBM tumors. They identified recurrent somatic mutations at Arg132 of IDH1 that were present in five of the six secondary GBMs but none of the 16 primary GBMs included in the study. Several follow-up sequencing studies of malignant gliomas confirmed that IDH1 Arg132 mutations are very common in specific types of adult brain tumors, occurring in >70% of adult grade II and grade III gliomas and >80% of adult secondary GBMs (Balss et al. 2008; Bleeker et al. 2009). Moreover, many of the grade II/III gliomas and secondary GBMs that are IDH1 wild type harbor mutations at the analogous codon, Arg172, of IDH2 (Hartmann et al. 2009; Yan et al. 2009). Overall, 80%–90% of adult grade II/III gliomas and secondary GBMs harbor mutations at either Arg132 of IDH1 or Arg172 of IDH2 (Table 1; Chang et al. 2011). Conversely, <10% of primary GBMs and pediatric GBMs harbor IDH mutations, and no IDH mutations have been identified to date in brain tumors of nonglial subtypes (Balss et al. 2008; Yan et al. 2009; Capper et al. 2010; Byeon et al. 2012).  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of IDH1 and IDH2 mutant alleles in human cancers In 2009, Mardis et al. (2009) performed whole-genome sequencing of a case of normal karyotype AML (NK-AML) and identified a mutation at Arg132 of IDH1. Further sequencing efforts confirmed that IDH mutations are highly recurrent in clonal myeloid disorders. Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are present in 5%–20% of cases of de novo NK-AML and in 10%–20% of cases of secondary AML that result from leukemic transformation of “premalignant” myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) (Kosmider et al. 2010; Pardanani et al. 2010; Tefferi et al. 2010; Patnaik et al. 2012; Rakheja et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2012). IDH mutations are also present, albeit at a lower frequency (5%–10%), in chronic-phase MDS and MPN but are rare in translocation-positive AML (Mardis et al. 2009; Abbas et al. 2010). IDH2 mutations are also present in 10%–40% of cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) but are uncommon in other T- or B-cell lymphoid malignancies (Cairns et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012).  IDH mutations have been found in a number of other solid tumors besides gliomas. Over 50% of chondrosarcomas harbor IDH mutations (Amary et al. 2011a; Arai et al. 2012; Meijer et al. 2012), and IDH mutations have been linked to the pathogenesis of the enchondromatosis syndromes Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome (Pansuriya et al. 2010). Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome are rare nonhereditary pediatric cancer predisposition syndromes in which affected children develop cartilaginous tumors as their developing bones undergo endochondral ossification. Recently, sequencing analysis has determined that 40%–90% of the tumors in these patients harbor mutations at Arg132 of IDH1 or Arg172 of IDH2 (Amary et al. 2011b; Pansuriya et al. 2011). Interestingly, many of these patients develop multiple independent IDH mutant tumors but express wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 in their normal tissues. This suggests that their IDH mutations are occurring during embryonic development and that their tumors are a consequence of somatic mosaicism of mutant IDH-expressing cells. Interestingly, Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome appear to be associated with an increased risk of secondary neoplasms; in particular, gliomas and AML. IDH mutations have also been found in 10%–20% of cholangiocarcinomas as well as a few rare cases of paraganglioma, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer (Sjoblom et al. 2006; Bleeker et al. 2009; Kang et al. 2009; Gaal et al. 2010; Sequist et al. 2011; Borger et al. 2012).  Among the cancers associated with IDH mutations, the mutations appear to have a predilection for certain tumor subtypes or locations. In cholangiocarcinoma, the frequency of IDH mutations in intrahepatic tumors is 28%, whereas the frequency is only 7% in extrahepatic tumors (Borger et al. 2012). In chondrosarcomas, IDH mutations appear to be exclusive to central, periosteal, and dedifferentiated tumors, with no IDH mutations having been identified to date in peripheral chondrosarcomas or other cartilaginous tumors (Amary et al. 2011a; Arai et al. 2012).  IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur at different frequencies in different tumor types (Table 1). In gliomas, >80% of IDH mutations occur at Arg132 of IDH1 and result in replacement of the arginine residue with a histidine (IDH1 R132H) (Balss et al. 2008; Yan et al. 2009; Chang et al. 2011). In cholangiocarcinomas and chondrosarcomas, IDH1 Arg132 mutations are also far more common than IDH2 Arg172 mutations, although the IDH1 mutations in these tumors most often result in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution (IDH1 R132C) (Amary et al. 2011a; Arai et al. 2012; Borger et al. 2012). This is in contrast to AML, where IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur at similar frequencies (Abbas et al. 2010; Marcucci et al. 2010; Paschka et al. 2010; Koszarska et al. 2012). The single most common IDH mutation in AML is the replacement of Arg140 of IDH2 with a glutamine (IDH2 R140Q). Interestingly, IDH2 Arg140 mutations have not been found in gliomas, cholangiocarcinomas, or chondrosarcomas. However, an IDH1 mutation analogous to Arg140 of IDH2, IDH1 Arg100, has been described in rare cases of glioma (Pusch et al. 2011). In AITL, all of the IDH mutations reported to date are IDH2 mutations, with >90% occurring at IDH2 Arg172 (Cairns et al. 2012). Why the frequency of these different amino acid substitutions is so variable in different tumors is not known. It is also worth noting that IDH1 and IDH2 mutations appear to be mutually exclusive. There are no reported cases of brain tumors harboring both mutations, and although rare cases of IDH1/IDH2 double mutant AML have been reported, it is not clear whether these mutations occur in the same or different leukemic subclones (Paschka et al. 2010).  The prognostic significance of IDH mutations is not consistent across all tumor types. In the case of GBM, IDH mutations appear to confer a more favorable prognosis, with a median survival for patients with IDH mutant GBM of 31 mo, as compared with a median survival of 15 mo for patients with IDH wild-type GBM (Yan et al. 2009; SongTao et al. 2012). Whether this difference is driven by the IDH mutational status of the tumors or reflects other fundamental biological differences between primary and secondary GBM is as yet unclear. In AML, the prognostic significance of IDH mutations is still somewhat ambiguous. Several studies have reported that IDH mutational status does not impact prognosis in AML, whereas other studies have found that IDH mutations are associated with an increased or decreased risk of disease relapse when compared with IDH wild-type disease, depending on the specific patient population examined (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2011; Rakheja et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2012). In MDS and MPN, IDH mutations have been consistently found to be markers of poor prognosis. Furthermore, the observation that the frequency of IDH mutations is higher in late stage MPN and high-risk MDS (20%) than in early stage and low-risk disease (<4%), coupled with the observation that IDH mutations are frequently present in secondary AML, has lead to speculation that IDH mutations are involved in the progression of chronic MDS and MPN to full-blown leukemia. (Tefferi et al. 2010, 2012; Thol et al. 2010; Patnaik et al. 2012).  Go to: Catalytic activity of mutant IDH When IDH mutations were first identified in cancer, they were hypothesized to contribute to tumorigenesis by causing loss of function and dominant-negative inhibition of wild-type IDH activity (Yan et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2009). However, subsequent studies found that, on the contrary, tumor-associated IDH mutations cause a gain of function (Dang et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2010). The mutations are all located in the active sites of the enzymes. Arg100 and Arg132 in IDH1 and Arg140 and Arg172 in IDH2 form hydrogen bonds with the α-carboxyl and β-carboxyl groups of isocitrate and mediate isocitrate binding (Xu et al. 2004). Mutations at these residues decrease the binding affinity of the enzyme active sites for isocitrate and increase their binding affinity for NADPH, which significantly abrogates the normal oxidative decarboxylation activity of the enzymes (Dang et al. 2009). In addition to abrogating the “forward” catalytic activity of IDH, the mutations change the conformation of the enzyme active site such that the “reverse” reaction is only a partial reaction, one in which 2OG is reduced but not carboxylated. This results in conversion of 2OG to (R)-2HG rather than isocitrate (Fig. 2). In short, IDH mutations cause the reverse IDH reaction to be favored but partially disrupted, leading to high-level production of (R)-2HG.  Interestingly, although IDH1 and IDH2 mutants both produce (R)-2HG, they appear to have somewhat distinct enzymatic properties. Cells that express mutant IDH1 accumulate less (R)-2HG than do mutant IDH2-expressing cells (Ward et al. 2013). Moreover, (R)-2HG production by mutant IDH1 is enhanced by coexpression of wild-type IDH1, whereas mutant IDH2-expressing cells accumulate high levels of (R)-2HG independent of wild-type IDH2 activity. It has been hypothesized that the lower production of (R)-2HG by mutant IDH1 is due to the fact that cytoplasmic 2OG is limiting in cells, whereas mitochondrial 2OG is not. Consistent with this model, the addition of a mitochondrial localization signal to mutant IDH1 results in enhanced (R)-2HG production. Interestingly, mutant IDH1 forms heterodimers with wild-type IDH1, but mutant IDH2 does not bind wild-type IDH2 (Dang et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2013). It has been hypothesized that heterodimerization of wild-type and mutant IDH1 in the cytoplasm provides the mutant subunit with a local source of 2OG that can then be metabolized to (R)-2HG. Consistent with this model, it has recently been reported that loss of the wild-type IDH1 allele in IDH1 mutant gliomas is associated with significantly lower tumor levels of (R)-2HG than are seen in heterozygous IDH1 mutant tumors (Jin et al. 2013).  Go to: Mutant IDH is an oncogene In a number of different in vitro transformation assays, expression of mutant IDH promotes the proliferation and inhibits the differentiation of cells. Expression of a tumor-derived IDH1 mutant (IDH1 R132H), but not a catalytically inactive form of the mutant enzyme, enhances the proliferation and soft agar colony formation of immortalized human astrocytes and confers growth factor independence and blocks the erythropoietin-induced differentiation of TF-1 cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line (Koivunen et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013). Expression of mutant IDH is also able to inhibit the differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and the differentiation of primary murine hematopoietic stem cells and immortalized murine myeloid progenitor cells (Figueroa et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013).  Although mutant IDH is able to promote cellular transformation in vitro, the mutant enzyme does not appear to be sufficient to transform primary cells in vivo. Sasaki et al. (2012a,b) have characterized the phenotype of a conditional knock-in mouse model in which they inserted IDH1 R132H into the endogenous IDH1 locus and expressed mutant IDH in either the brains or the hematopoietic systems of mice. Brain-specific expression of IDH1 R132H during embryogenesis results in perinatal lethality of the mice from cerebral hemorrhage without evidence of underlying malignancy (Sasaki et al. 2012a). Although it is possible that the mice would develop brain tumors if they lived longer, the hematopoietic-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, which have a normal life span, similarly do not develop malignancy (Sasaki et al. 2012b).  Despite the lack of a cancer phenotype in the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, the hematopoietic stem cell phenotype of the mice does provide some insights into how mutant IDH contributes to tumorigenesis. Although IDH1 R132H-expressing bone marrow cells are not immortalized, the mice do show selective expansion of their hematopoietic stem and early progenitor compartments but not their committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitor compartments. This observation is quite interesting given the distinct self-renewal properties of these different cell types. Normal committed progenitors are unable to self-renew and are consigned to undergo further differentiation, whereas stem cells and early progenitors have inherent self-renewal capabilities (Chao et al. 2008; Orford and Scadden 2008; Seita and Weissman 2010). When stem cells and early progenitors divide, they make the decision to undergo either symmetric division, in which both daughter cells are identical to the original cell, or asymmetric division, in which one daughter cell is identical to the original cell and the other is committed to undergoing further differentiation. The balance between symmetric and asymmetric cell division is crucial to cellular homeostasis. Excessive symmetric division causes inappropriate expansion of stem cell compartments, whereas excessive asymmetric division results in stem cell exhaustion (Jacob and Osato 2009; Marciniak-Czochra et al. 2009; Matsumoto and Nakayama 2013). The observation that only stem and early progenitor cells are expanded in the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice suggests that mutant IDH promotes leukemogenesis by increasing symmetric division within a population of cells that have inherent self-renewal capacity but that mutant IDH is not, by itself, able to immortalize self-renewing cells or bestow self-renewal upon more differentiated cells. This observation has important biological implications. The limited ability of mutant IDH to promote the proliferation of primary cells suggests that the specific cell lineage in which the IDH mutation occurs significantly influences the ability of the mutation to contribute to transformation. An IDH mutation in a committed progenitor cell would likely not confer a proliferative advantage to that cell, whereas the same mutation in a more primitive cell would contribute to clonal expansion.  It is also notable that hematopoietic stem cells isolated from IDH1 R132H knock-in mice are able to differentiate normally in vitro and are able to competitively repopulate the bone marrow of transplanted recipient mice. This suggests that expression of mutant IDH has little if any effect on cellular differentiation in otherwise normal hematopoietic cells. This limited ability of mutant IDH to block the differentiation of normal primary cells suggests that other specific mutations that cooperate with mutant IDH to block cellular differentiation are likely to be required to bring about the maturation arrest that is characteristic of leukemia cells.  Go to: Mutant IDH-derived (R)-2HG is an oncometabolite 2HG is a five-carbon dicarboxylic acid with a chiral center at the second carbon atom (Fig. 2). There are therefore two possible enantiomers of 2HG: (R)-2HG [otherwise known as (D)-2HG] and (S)-2HG [otherwise known as (L)-2HG]. (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG are both byproducts of normal mitochondrial metabolism (Kranendijk et al. 2012). The principal source of (R)-2HG in IDH wild-type cells is a reaction catalyzed by hydroxyacid–oxoacid transhydrogenase (HOT) (Struys et al. 2005b). HOT converts γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) to succinic semialdehyde (SSA), with concomitant reduction of 2OG to (R)-2HG. (S)-2HG is generated during conversion of oxaloacetate to (L)-malate by (L)-malate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the TCA cycle (Rzem et al. 2007).  (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG are believed to be unwanted byproducts of cellular metabolism, and their intracellular levels in normal cells are maintained at <0.1 mM. 2HG is prevented from accumulating in cells by the actions of two enzymes—(D)-2HG and (L)-2HG dehydrogenase (2HGDH)—that convert (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG, respectively, back to 2OG (Struys et al. 2005a; Steenweg et al. 2010). There is currently no known physiologic role for either enantiomer in normal metabolism.  IDH mutants exclusively produce the (R) enantiomer of 2HG, and the levels of (R)-2HG in IDH mutant tumors can be extremely elevated, ranging from 1 mM to as high as 30 mM (Dang et al. 2009; Gross et al. 2010; Choi et al. 2012). These high levels of (R)-2HG appear to be a consequence of a significant imbalance between (R)-2HG production and metabolism in tumor cells. IDH1 R132H has an estimated catalytic rate (Kcat) of 1.0 × 103 sec−1 (Dang et al. 2009), whereas recombinant D2HGDH has an estimated Kcat of 0.8 sec−1 (Engqvist et al. 2009). It is therefore likely that mutant IDH overwhelms the capacity of D2HGDH to oxidize the excess (R)-2HG back to 2OG. This model is supported by the observation that in patients with type I (D)-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D2HGA), an inborn neurometabolic disorder caused by germline mutations in D2HGDH, levels of (R)-2HG are elevated but to a much lesser extent than is observed in IDH mutant tumors (Wickenhagen et al. 2009). Type II D2HGA, which is caused by germline IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R140G mutations, is associated with higher levels of (R)-2HG and a more severe clinical course (Kranendijk et al. 2010, 2011). Interestingly, D2HGA is not associated with an increased incidence of cancer. It is important to note, however, that many patients with severe D2HGA die in infancy and early childhood, and it is therefore difficult to make definitive conclusions about an association between high levels of (R)-2HG and long-term susceptibility to cancer.  High intracellular concentrations of (R)-2HG are sufficient to mediate the in vitro transforming effects of mutant IDH. Treatment of TF-1 leukemia cells with concentrations of a cell-permeable form of (R)-2HG that achieve tumor-relevant intracellular levels is able to recapitulate the effects of mutant IDH expression (Losman et al. 2013), and treatment of cells with cell-permeable (R)-2HG is able to inhibit the differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and immortalized murine myeloid progenitor cells (Lu et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013). Furthermore, tumor cells that harbor IDH mutations and produce high levels of (R)-2HG appear to require continuous (R)-2HG to remain transformed. Withdrawal of (R)-2HG from TF-1 leukemia cells transformed by cell-permeable (R)-2HG reverses their growth factor independence and restores their ability to differentiate (Losman et al. 2013), and inhibition of mutant IDH1 expression in glioma cell lines that harbor naturally occurring IDH1 R132H mutations impairs in vitro colony formation and in vivo tumor engraftment by the cells (Rohle et al. 2013). Finally, highly potent and specific inhibitors of mutant IDH have been developed that are able to reverse the transformation of TF-1 cells expressing IDH1 R132H and IDH2 R140Q (Popovici-Muller et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013). These inhibitors also induce the differentiation of primary IDH mutant human leukemia cells in vitro and recapitulate the effects of suppression of IDH1 R132H expression in IDH mutant glioma cell lines in vitro and in vivo (Rohle et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013). Taken together, these findings suggest that the transforming activity of mutant IDH is mediated by (R)-2HG and that (R)-2HG is necessary to maintain the transformed phenotype of tumor cells that harbor IDH mutations.  Go to: Mechanisms of transformation by (R)-2HG Several mechanisms of mutant IDH-mediated transformation have been proposed. One model for how mutant IDH contributes to tumorigenesis, and the one that has perhaps gained the most traction since the discovery of (R)-2HG, is transformation by 2OG antagonism. (R)-2HG is structurally and chemically very similar to 2OG (Fig. 2), and it has been proposed that (R)-2HG transforms cells by competitively inhibiting 2OG-dependent enzymes that function as tumor suppressors (Chowdhury et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012; Lu et al. 2012). There are ∼70 known and putative 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in the GenBank DNA database that could be relevant targets of (R)-2HG in mutant IDH-mediated transformation (Table 2).  Table 2. Table 2. List of known and putative 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in the in the GenBank DNA database TET2  The myeloid tumor suppressor TET2 is a particularly intriguing candidate to be a pathogenically relevant target of (R)-2HG in IDH mutant tumors. TET1, TET2, and TET3 are members of a family of 2OG-dependent DNA-modifying enzymes that hydroxylate 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to generate 5-hydroxymethycytosine (5hmC) (Tahiliani et al. 2009; Ito et al. 2010). The TET enzymes are also able to further oxidize 5hmC to generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) (He et al. 2011; Ito et al. 2011). Somatic mutations in TET2, including chromosomal microdeletions and missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, are common in clonal myeloid disorders, occurring in 10%–40% of cases of AML, MDS, MPN, and CMML (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2009; Delhommeau et al. 2009; Tefferi et al. 2009; Couronne et al. 2010; Chou et al. 2011). Interestingly, TET2 appears to be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Although a subset of cases of MDS and AML present with biallelic TET2 loss, the majority of cases present with heterozygous TET2 mutations (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2009; Bejar et al. 2011; Gaidzik et al. 2012). The other TET family members are not recurrently mutated in hematopoietic malignancies, although TET1 is an infrequent MLL fusion partner in rare cases of MLL translocation-positive AML (Lorsbach et al. 2003).  TET enzymes are thought to play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by mediating the demethylation of DNA. The conversion of 5mC to 5hmC and then to 5fC and 5caC by TET enzymes results in the generation of guanine:oxidized cytosine base-pair mismatches. It has been hypothesized that these mismatches are substrates for base excision repair by thymine–DNA glycosylase (TDG) (He et al. 2011; Raiber et al. 2012). It has also been suggested that 5caC residues are substrates for an as yet unidentified enzyme that can decarboxylate 5caC to generate unmethylated cytosine (Ito et al. 2011). In either case, oxidation of 5mC by TET enzymes, followed by TDG-mediated base excision or 5caC decarboxylation, would result in DNA demethylation. Indeed, overexpression of TET2 in HEK293 cells results in decreased 5mC levels and increased 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC levels, whereas knockdown of TET1 in mouse embryonic stem cells results in decreased 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC levels (Ito et al. 2011).  Given the putative role for TET2 in DNA demethylation, it would be expected that loss of TET2 activity should impair DNA demethylation and result in DNA hypermethylation. However, different studies have found inconsistent and even contradictory associations between TET2 mutational status and DNA methylation status in myeloid diseases. One study reported that TET2 mutant AML has a DNA hypermethylation signature (Figueroa et al. 2010). Two other studies found that genomic DNA is hypermethylated in TET2 wild-type myeloid diseases and is hypomethylated in TET2 mutant myeloid diseases (Ko et al. 2010; Perez et al. 2012). In yet another study, 5hmC levels were reported to be lower in TET2 mutant CMML than in TET2 wild-type disease, but global DNA methylation was the same in both cohorts (Yamazaki et al. 2012). In this last study, when locus-specific CpG island methylation was analyzed, only 11 of 27,578 CpG sites were differentially methylated between 5hmC-low and 5hmC-high patient samples. In the 5hmC-low patient samples, of the differentially methylated CpG sites, two were hypermethylated and the other nine were hypomethylated, suggesting that 5hmC levels do not correlate with 5mC levels at all. Some of these inconsistencies may be due to technical differences in experimental approach. It is also possible that TET2 mutations alter the methylation state of DNA at specific loci and only variably alter global DNA methylation.  Although 5mC and 5hmC are the only known substrates of TET2, TET2 may have other hydroxylation substrates besides DNA that mediate its tumor suppressor functions. Moreover, the hydroxylation of 5mC and the oxidation of 5hmC by TET2 might have other functions besides being intermediate steps in DNA demethylation. It has been observed that, in some cells, 5hmC modifications are copied to daughter strands during DNA replication (Szulwach et al. 2011). This requires a considerable expenditure of energy, as the daughter strands would first need to be methylated and then hydroxylated in order to maintain parental DNA 5hmC status. It seems unlikely that there would be significant selective pressure to maintain a nonfunctional transitional state of DNA demethylation. Rather, it seems more likely that 5hmC modifications and perhaps also 5fC and 5caC modifications play specific roles in the regulation of 5mC in the regulation of gene expression, perhaps by serving as recognition sites for the binding of distinct epigenetic and transcriptional regulators. Consistent with this hypothesis, specific “readers” of 5mC, 5hmC, and oxidized forms of 5hmC have recently been identified (Mellen et al. 2012; Spruijt et al. 2013). These include the transcriptional repressor MeCP2, which preferentially binds 5mC and 5hmC; the cell cycle regulator p53, which preferentially binds 5fC; and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, which preferentially binds 5caC. How the binding of these “readers” to modified cytosine residues contributes to the regulation of gene expression is not well understood, but it is likely that any perturbation of these interactions through imbalances in hydroxylation and oxidation of cytosine residues would have profound effects on cellular homeostasis.  There are several lines of evidence to suggest that TET2 is an important target of (R)-2HG in mutant IDH-mediated transformation. The catalytic activity of TET2 is potently inhibited by (R)-2HG in vitro (Xu et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012). Furthermore, IDH mutant brain tumors and leukemias frequently display global DNA hypermethylation signatures (Figueroa et al. 2010; Ko et al. 2010; Turcan et al. 2012). Perhaps the most persuasive evidence for a link between IDH and TET2 mutations is the observation that IDH mutations are mutually exclusive with TET2 mutations in AML (Figueroa et al. 2010; Gaidzik et al. 2012). This suggests that the two mutations act on the same leukemogenic pathways and have redundant effects on cellular transformation. Indeed, (R)-2HG enhances the transforming effects of partial inhibition of TET2. In TF-1 cells, depletion of TET2 induces growth factor independence and blocks cellular differentiation similarly to expression of mutant IDH, and this transformation by TET2 depletion is potentiated by cell-permeable (R)-2HG (Losman et al. 2013).  It is unclear whether TET2 and IDH are similarly linked in other tumors. Depletion of TET2 in immortalized human astrocytes phenocopies the transforming effects of mutant IDH expression, but TET2 mutations have not been described in brain tumors (Koivunen et al. 2012). Interestingly, TET2 promoter methylation is increased in some cases of IDH wild-type grade II/III glioma (Kim et al. 2011). Given that promoter methylation is frequently associated with transcriptional silencing, this suggests that TET2 expression and activity are lost in these IDH wild-type gliomas. Taken as a whole, these observations suggest that loss of TET2 activity by either a loss-of-function mutational event, epigenetic silencing, or inhibition of TET2 activity by (R)-2HG is a frequent and important pathogenic event in brain tumors and myeloid diseases.  The evidence that IDH and TET2 mutations function in the same oncogenic pathway notwithstanding, it is worth noting that the phenotype of the conditional TET2 knockout mouse is quite distinct from that of the IDH1 R132H knock-in mouse described above (Moran-Crusio et al. 2011; Sasaki et al. 2012b). Homozygous deletion of TET2 in the hematopoietic compartment of mice does not cause leukemia but does result in a more significant expansion of hematopoietic stem and early progenitor cells than is seen in IDH1 R132H knock-in mice. Furthermore, TET2-null hematopoietic stem cells have a marked competitive repopulating advantage in transplanted recipient mice when compared with TET2 wild-type stem cells. This increased repopulating activity is not seen with IDH1 R132H knock-in stem cells, suggesting that self-renewal is more markedly enhanced by loss of TET2 than by expression of mutant IDH. TET2-null mice also show granulocyte and monocyte precursor lineage expansion and a skewing of myeloid differentiation toward monocyte/macrophage lineages, phenotypes that are not observed in IDH1 R132H knock-in mice.  There appears to be a dose-dependent effect of loss of TET2 activity on murine hematopoiesis. Mice with heterozygous loss of TET2 show an intermediate hematologic phenotype, with a less dramatic increase in stem cell self-renewal and a less dramatic dysregulation of myeloid differentiation than is seen in the TET2-null mice. This observation raises an interesting point. If transformation by TET2 suppression is indeed gene dosage-dependent, then it is reasonable to assume that selective pressure exists for heterozygous TET2 mutant cells and IDH mutant cells to further inhibit TET2 activity. A heterozygous TET2 mutant clone could do this by mutating the remaining wild-type TET2 allele or acquiring an IDH mutation. An IDH mutant clone could do this by acquiring a TET2 mutation. Why, then, are IDH mutations and heterozygous TET2 mutations mutually exclusive? One possible explanation is that the clonal advantage conferred by loss of TET2 is less dose-dependent in human myeloid cells than it is in mice. A cell that has already partially inhibited TET2 activity by either losing one allele of TET2 or acquiring an IDH mutation might not benefit significantly from further TET2 inhibition. With this in mind, it is interesting to note that, although biallelic TET2 loss is relatively common in MDS, occurring in >25% of cases, complete loss of TET2 is not associated with a more aggressive clinical disease phenotype (Jankowska et al. 2009; Mohamedali et al. 2009; Bejar et al. 2011).  Another possible explanation for the mutual exclusivity of TET2 and IDH mutations in leukemia is that acquisition of an IDH mutation confers a clonal disadvantage to TET2 mutant cells. Cells expressing mutant IDH grow more slowly under optimal culture conditions than their parental counterparts (Seltzer et al. 2010; Bralten et al. 2011; Losman et al. 2013). This suggests that mutant IDH and (R)-2HG have growth-suppressive effects that coexist with their transforming, growth-promoting effects. Perhaps in cells that do not require mutant IDH for cell growth and survival (for example, cells in which TET2 is already mutated), the negative effects of (R)-2HG on proliferation overwhelm the positive effects of (R)-2HG on transformation. This explanation could also account for the less pronounced phenotype of the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice as compared with the TET2 conditional knockout mice. Perhaps the mild phenotype of the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice is not the result of inadequate inhibition of TET2 but rather is a reflection of the balance between the protransforming effects of (R)-2HG inhibition of TET2 and the anti-transforming effects of (R)-2HG inhibition of other, growth-promoting enzymes.  JmjC histone demethylases  The JmjC family of histone lysine demethylases is another family of enzymes that may be a pathogenically relevant target of (R)-2HG. Histone demethylases play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression (Klose et al. 2006; Shilatifard 2006). Histone methylation defines the structure of chromatin, and methylation of some histone residues (H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79) is often associated with transcriptionally active euchromatin, whereas other histone methylation marks (H3K9, H3K27, and H4K20) are usually associated with transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. The patterns of histone methylation at different genetic loci are a function of the balance between the activities of histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases, each of which binds and alters the methylation of specific histone lysine residues. Disruption of histone methylation or demethylation can have profound effects on gene expression, and JmjC histone demethylases have been linked to the pathogenesis of a number of different cancers (Cloos et al. 2008; Varier and Timmers 2011).  Several JmjC histone demethylases appear to function as tumor suppressors. The H3K36 JmjC demethylase KDM2B (JHDM1B/FBX10) is a transcriptional repressor that regulates ribosomal gene expression and represses c-Jun-mediated transcription (Frescas et al. 2007; Koyama-Nasu et al. 2007). Consistent with its putative role as a tumor suppressor, KDM2B expression is significantly lower in brain tumors than in normal brain tissue. The H3K9 JmjC demethylase KDM3B (JMJD1B) is frequently deleted in 5q− MDS and AML (Hu et al. 2001), and the H3K4 JmjC demethylase KDM5C (JARID1C) is occasionally mutated and inactivated in clear cell renal carcinoma (Dalgliesh et al. 2010; Hakimi et al. 2013). The H3K27 JmjC demethylase KDM6A (UTX) and its paralog, KDM6B (JMJD3), can also function as tumor suppressors. KDM6A cooperates with the Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein to enforce cell cycle blockade and also negatively regulates the activity of NOTCH (Herz et al. 2010; Terashima et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010). KDM6B is involved in the regulation of p53 and has been shown to promote the terminal differentiation of glioblastoma cells (Barradas et al. 2009; Sola et al. 2011).  It is possible that inhibition of tumor suppressor histone demethylases by (R)-2HG contributes to transformation by mutant IDH. In fact, (R)-2HG has been shown to inhibit the activity of many 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in vitro, including the JmjC histone demethylases KDM2A, KDM4A, KDM4C, and KDM7A (Chowdhury et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2012). Although the IC50 values for inhibition of 2OG-dependent enzymes by (R)-2HG vary considerably (ranging from 25 μM to >10 mM), it is important to remember that (R)-2HG can accumulate to millimolar levels in tumors. Moreover, overexpression of mutant IDH and treatment of cells with cell-permeable (R)-2HG has been reported to increase H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, and H3K79 histone methylation marks in cell culture models (Lu et al. 2012).  The biological significance of the histone methylation changes induced in vitro by (R)-2HG is not clear, and it is not yet known whether (R)-2HG affects histone methylation in primary human IDH mutant tumors. H3K9 trimethylation is frequently increased in IDH mutant gliomas (Vanneti et al. 2013). However, many IDH wild-type gliomas also display H3K9 hypermethylation, suggesting that aberrant histone methylation is a common finding in brain tumors irrespective of IDH mutational status. In the hematopoietic-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, bone marrow stem cells show a modest increase in methylated H3K4 levels but no change in other histone methylation marks (Sasaki et al. 2012b). Furthermore, no differences in global histone methylation are apparent in the brains of the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice (Sasaki et al. 2012a). Although this could be interpreted as evidence that (R)-2HG does not significantly affect histone methylation in vivo, it is also possible that (R)-2HG induces biologically important changes in histone methylation only at specific genetic loci that promote tumor formation. Histone methylation changes that are beneficial could be preferentially retained in mutant IDH-expressing cells, whereas deleterious changes could be reversed by compensatory changes such as down-regulation of specific histone methyltransferases.  As described above, several JmjC histone demethylases can function as tumor suppressors. However, some histone demethylases are also known to promote tumor growth. Moreover, there are multiple examples of chromatin-modifying enzymes—including histone demethylases and their opposing methyltransferases—that can act as either oncoproteins or tumor suppressors in different cellular contexts (Cloos et al. 2008). It is interesting to speculate that the different functions of the JmjC histone demethylases in different tissues could explain, at least in part, the tissue specificity of IDH mutations in cancer. If the proliferation and survival of a particular cell were dependent on the activity of JmjC histone demethylases that are potently inhibited by (R)-2HG, that cell would likely be relatively resistant to transformation by mutant IDH. Conversely, a cell in which those same JmjC histone demethylases are dispensable for proliferation or have tumor suppressor functions might be particularly vulnerable to transformation by mutant IDH.  EglN prolyl-4-hydroxylases  EglN1, EglN2, and EglN3 are members of a family of 2OG-dependent dioxygenases that regulate the activity of HIF, a heterodimeric transcription factor that mediates the cellular response to hypoxia (Kaelin and Ratcliffe 2008; Semenza 2012). In the presence of oxygen, EglN hydroxylates specific proline residues on HIFα, and these hydroxylated proline residues are then recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3–ubiquitin ligase complex. The VHL complex polyubiquitylates HIFα and targets it for proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, when intracellular levels of oxygen are low, the activity of EglN is inhibited. This permits accumulation of HIFα, which can then heterodimerize with HIFβ, translocate to the nucleus, and activate the transcriptional response of cells to hypoxia. EglN1 is believed to be the principal HIF prolyl-hydroxylase, with EglN2 and EglN3 playing variable compensatory roles in the regulation of HIF in different tissues under specific cellular conditions.  EglN enzymes were initially reported to be inhibited by (R)-2HG (Zhao et al. 2009). However, further study has shown that, on the contrary, (R)-2HG potentiates EglN activity in vitro and in vivo and blunts the induction of HIFα in response to hypoxia in cell culture models (Koivunen et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013). Consistent with this observation, IDH mutant brain tumors display decreased HIF activation compared with their wild-type counterparts (Williams et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012). It should be noted that HIFα levels are elevated in the brains of the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice (Sasaki et al. 2012a). However, these mice succumb at birth to cerebral hemorrhage, suggesting that their brain perfusion during development is abnormal. It is possible that tissue hypoxia, rather than a direct effect of (R)-2HG on EglN activity, is the cause of increased brain levels of HIFα in these mice.  Likewise, there is no evidence that HIF is activated in human IDH mutant leukemias. On the contrary, there is evidence to suggest that activation of HIF inhibits myeloid leukemia. A number of human myeloid leukemia cell lines have been reported to proliferate more slowly and undergo terminal differentiation and apoptosis upon exposure to hypoxia and upon overexpression of HIFα (Huang et al. 2003; di Giacomo et al. 2009; Zhang and Chen 2009; He et al. 2013), and inhibition of HIFα expression by RNAi blocks the differentiation of leukemia cells in response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (Zhang et al. 2008; Zhang and Chen 2009). Moreover, in a mouse model of acute promyelocytic leukemia, exposure of diseased mice to intermittent hypoxia induces leukemia cell differentiation and prolongs survival of the mice (Liu et al. 2006). These observations suggest that HIF may be a tumor suppressor in myeloid leukemia. However, it is not known whether the HIF response to hypoxia is truly blunted in IDH mutant tumors in vivo, as one would predict given that (R)-2HG can serve as an EglN agonist.  The ability of (R)-2HG to function as an EglN cosubstrate appears to play an important role in mutant IDH-mediated cellular transformation. In immortalized human astrocytes, either overexpression of EglN1 or depletion of HIF1α is sufficient to promote soft agar colony formation (Koivunen et al. 2012). Conversely, depletion of EglN1 in mutant IDH-transformed astrocytes inhibits the growth and soft agar colony formation of the cells. Intriguingly, (S)-2HG, which potently inhibits EglN in vitro, is unable to promote transformation of TF-1 leukemia cells. In fact, (S)-2HG antagonizes TF-1 cell transformation induced by TET2 loss (Losman et al. 2013). This is despite the fact that (S)-2HG is a more potent inhibitor of TET2 than is (R)-2HG (Xu et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012). Depletion of EglN1 in transformed TF-1 cells reverses transformation induced by expression of mutant IDH or by depletion of TET2, suggesting that the anti-leukemic properties of (S)-2HG relate to its ability to inhibit EglN1 (Losman et al. 2013). In short, inhibition of EglN1 by (S)-2HG reverses the leukemic transformation that would otherwise ensue as a result of its inhibition of TET2 activity.  Other candidate targets of (R)-2HG  A number of other 2OG-dependent enzymes might be inhibited by (R)-2HG in IDH mutant tumors (Table 2). Three types of collagen hydroxylases—the Leprecan family of prolyl-3-hydroxylases, the P4HA family of prolyl-4-hydroxylases, and the PLOD family of lysyl-5-hydroxylases—all require 2OG for activity, and P4HA1 has been found to be inhibited by (R)-2HG in vitro (Koivunen et al. 2012). The collagen prolyl-hydroxylases mediate the hydroxylation of proline residues required for formation of the collagen triple helix (Gorres and Raines 2010), and the collagen lysyl-hydroxylases mediate the hydroxylation of lysine residues required for collagen cross-linking into stable fibrils (Bank et al. 1999). Interestingly, collagen maturation has been found to be impaired in the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, suggesting that these enzymes are targets of inhibition by mutant IDH in vivo (Sasaki et al. 2012a). Although a role for these enzymes in cancer has not been established, the observation that expression of collagen prolyl-3-hydroxylases and prolyl-4-hydroxylases is down-regulated in many B-cell lymphomas suggests that these enzymes function as tumor suppressors in some tissues (Teodoro et al. 2006; Hatzimichael et al. 2012).  Other potential 2OG-dependent targets of (R)-2HG include FIH1 (factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1), an asparaginyl hydroxylase that regulates the transcriptional activity of HIF (Mahon et al. 2001); the ABH family of DNA demethylases that are involved in DNA damage repair (Lee et al. 2005); and the RNA demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated), which is believed to be important for the regulation of cellular metabolism (Jia et al. 2008; Berulava et al. 2013).  Go to: Other possible mechanisms of transformation by mutant IDH Another proposed mechanism of transformation by mutant IDH harkens back to Warburg's mitochondrial model of oncogenesis. Warburg (1956) hypothesized that the primary defect in cancer cells is impaired mitochondrial function, which causes cells to switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Warburg's model has been somewhat discredited by the observation that mitochondrial function is not impaired in most cancer cells (Wallace 2012). However, there are data to suggest that (R)-2HG directly interferes with normal mitochondrial function. Some D2HGA patients have elevated levels of urinary lactate, suggesting that they have some degree of mitochondrial dysfunction (Kranendijk et al. 2012). Furthermore, the activity of two enzyme complexes in the electron transport chain, complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and complex V (ATP synthase), can be inhibited by (R)-2HG in vitro (Kolker et al. 2002; Latini et al. 2005). Inhibition of ATP synthase expression and activity has been observed in some cancers and is believed to directly promote cellular transformation by causing the accumulation of excess electrons that are then transferred to molecular oxygen to generate superoxide (O2−) (Willers and Cuezva 2011).  Mutant IDH-expressing cells may have an impaired ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Latini et al. 2003). Conversion of 2OG to (R)-2HG by mutant IDH consumes NADPH, and the high catalytic rate of the mutant IDH reaction could conceivably result in depletion of cellular NADPH (Yan et al. 2009; Bleeker et al. 2010). NADPH is the electron donor used by glutathione reductase to regenerate reduced glutathione, which is the principal cellular and mitochondrial antioxidant that regulates cellular redox (Kirsch and De Groot 2001; Block and Gorin 2012). Depletion of NADPH might therefore decrease the ability of cells to neutralize DNA-damaging oxygen-free radicals. NADPH also has other regulatory functions in cells that could contribute to cellular transformation. NADPH plays a role in nutrient sensing and participates in the regulation of the cellular metabolic rate (Newsholme et al. 2010; Newsholme and Krause 2012), and NADPH is also involved in the regulation of thioredoxins, enzymes that regulate the thiol-disulphide redox state and activity of several transcription factors, including NF-κB and AP1 (Arner and Holmgren 2000; Kabe et al. 2005).  Although dysregulation of cellular redox has been shown to contribute to transformation in other types of cancer, it is not clear whether NADPH and ROS are in fact dysregulated in IDH mutant tumors. Consistent with the notion that mutant IDH can perturb cellular NADPH levels, the embryonic brains of the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice have a slight increase in their NADP+:NADPH ratio and slightly decreased levels of reduced glutathione (Sasaki et al. 2012a). However, the brains of the IDH1 R132H mice have lower, not higher, levels of ROS than control mice. In the hematopoietic-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, the NADP+:NADPH ratio and the levels of ROS are normal in the bone marrow (Sasaki et al. 2012b). Despite the apparent lack of increased ROS in the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, it is nonetheless possible that cellular redox dysregulation plays a role in transformation by mutant IDH. The mice may have subtle or compartmentalized, and yet pathophysiologically relevant, perturbations in their brain and bone marrow redox states that only become apparent under conditions of oxidative stress. It is also possible that otherwise normal cells have compensatory mechanisms that largely maintain redox homeostasis in the presence of mutant IDH and that these mechanisms are defective in cancer cells.  Another potential contributor to mutant IDH-mediated transformation is deficiency of wild-type IDH activity. Although most tumor-associated mutations in IDH result in (R)-2HG production, a few rare IDH1 and IDH2 mutants that do not produce (R)-2HG have recently been identified in lymphoid and thyroid tumors (Ward et al. 2012). These mutations are monoallelic and result in either decreased enzymatic activity or loss of expression of the mutant enzyme. It has not yet been determined whether these loss-of-function mutations contribute to cellular transformation or are simply passenger mutations, but they do raise the possibility that IDH haploinsufficiency in IDH mutant cells could be tumorigenic.  Go to: Therapeutic targeting of IDH mutant tumors The observation that (R)-2HG is sufficient to promote cellular transformation and that transformation by (R)-2HG is reversible suggests that inhibiting (R)-2HG production by mutant IDH would have efficacy in the treatment of IDH mutant cancers. In this regard, first-generation mutant IDH inhibitors capable of suppressing the production of (R)-2HG in vitro and in vivo have recently been reported (Popovici-Muller et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013; Rohle et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013).  As described above, EglN activation plays a causal role in the transformation of astrocytes by mutant IDH in cell culture models and appears to play a permissive role in the transformation of TF-1 leukemia cells by mutant IDH. These findings, if proven robust, warrant further exploration of the potential of EglN inhibitors for the treatment of IDH mutant neoplasms. A number of EglN inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of anemia and tissue ischemia, some of which have advanced to human clinical trials (Robinson et al. 2008; Miyata et al. 2011; Sen Banerjee et al. 2012; Forristal et al. 2013).  Finally, it seems likely that the millimolar levels of (R)-2HG that accumulate in IDH mutant tumors also create certain liabilities for tumor cells. For example, inhibition of certain enzymes by (R)-2HG, whether they are pathogenic targets or “bystanders,” might decrease cellular fitness and hence decrease the resistance of cells to certain forms of therapeutic attack. There is some indirect evidence to support this idea. For example, introduction of mutant IDH into TF-1 cells confers a growth disadvantage to the cells under cytokine-rich conditions even though mutant IDH confers a growth advantage to the cells under cytokine-poor conditions (Losman et al. 2013). Moreover, stable expression of IDH1 R132H impedes the growth and migration of human IDH1 wild-type GBM cell lines both in vitro and in mouse xenografts models (Bralten et al. 2011). The relatively good prognosis and enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation therapy of IDH mutant brain tumors might also reflect deleterious effects of (R)-2HG in tumor cells (Houillier et al. 2010; SongTao et al. 2012; Li et al. 2013). Therefore, another strategy for tackling IDH mutant tumors could be to systematically identify and target the unique dependencies that are created in the presence of millimolar concentrations of (R)-2HG, thereby converting the oncometabolite into an Achilles' heel.  Mutations in the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are a common feature of a major subset of primary human brain cancers. These mutations occur at a single amino acid residue of the IDH1 active site resulting in loss of the enzyme’s ability to catalyze conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. However, only a single copy of the gene is mutated in tumors, raising the possibility that the mutations do not result in a simple loss of function. Here we show that cancer-associated IDH1 mutations result in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(−)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Structural studies demonstrate that when R132 is mutated to histidine, residues in the active site are shifted to produce structural changes consistent with reduced oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate and acquisition of the ability to convert α-ketoglutarate to 2HG. Excess accumulation of 2HG has been shown to lead to an elevated risk of malignant brain tumors in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism. Similarly, in human malignant gliomas harboring IDH1 mutations, we find dramatically elevated levels of 2HG. These data demonstrate that the IDH1 mutations result in production of the onco-metabolite 2HG, and suggest that the excess 2HG which accumulates in vivo contributes to the formation and malignant progression of gliomas.  Mutations in the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are found in approximately 80% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas in humans 1–3. These mutations occur at a single amino acid residue of IDH1, arginine 132, which is most commonly mutated to histidine (R132H)1, 3, 4. Only a single copy of the gene has been found to be mutated in tumors 1–6. Many of the high grade gliomas with IDH1 mutations are secondary glioblastomas that have progressed from lower grade lesions 1–3, 5. When analyzed in relation to other genes implicated in brain tumors, the compiled evidence suggests that IDH1 is often the first mutation that occurs 2. While these findings suggest that IDH1 mutations are selected for early during tumorigenesis, why mutations in a single allele of IDH1 result in predilection for malignant progression is uncertain. It has been reported that the R132H mutation disrupts the ability of IDHl to convert isocitrate to αKG 3, 7, but the consequences of this impaired enzymatic activity on cellular metabolism have not been systematically analyzed. For example, while R132 IDH1 mutations might reduce the rate of cytosolic αKG production as suggested by others 7, whether IDH1 mutations can influence the enzyme’s ability to act on αKG as a substrate has not been explored. This latter activity may be particularly important for the tumorigenic role of IDH1 mutations since cytosolic αKG is in equilibrium via transamination with the glutamate that plays a unique role in glial cell physiology, and IDH1 mutations are especially prevalent in malignant gliomas.  Go to: Metabolite profiling identifies elevated 2HG levels in IDH1 mutant expressing cells To understand the impact of IDH1 mutation on cellular metabolism, we profiled metabolites to identify changes in metabolite levels in cells expressing R132 mutant IDH1 compared with cells expressing wild-type IDH1. To initiate these studies, we stably transfected U87MG glioblastoma cells, which are wild-type for IDH1, with myc-tagged wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1. Cells expressing either myc-tagged wild-type or mutant IDH1 were used for metabolite profiling experiments (Figure 1a). Metabolites extracted from exponentially growing cells were profiled by liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In initial survey analyses, full-scan LC-MS in negative ion mode (exact mass) was used to examine differences in metabolite species with an m/z between 110 and 1000. Relative quantitative data were collected for approximately 850 ions and identities were proposed by comparison with known human metabolites. Identities of > 100 species identified by a combination of exact mass and retention time match to purified standards were assigned 8. There were no significant differences between cells expressing wild-type IDH1 when compared with parental cells. The levels of most observed ions were also similar between wild type and R132H mutant IDH1 expressing cells (Figure 1b), with no significant changes found in canonical TCA cycle species (P > 0.05 for citrate, isocitrate, αKG, succinate, fumarate, and malate). However, three species were significantly more abundant in R132H mutant IDH1 expressing cells (P < 0.001 for each). The mass of the one of these ions matched precisely to 2HG (expected m/z 147.0299, measured 147.0299). The other ions co-eluted with 2HG, and had masses consistent with the sodium adduct and a dehydrated form of 2HG. Subsequent injection of 2HG standard confirmed a retention time match to the biological peak, and that it forms all three of the observed ions during LC-MS ionization (data not shown). The cellular accumulation of 2HG was quantified by targeted triple-quadrupole LC-MS-MS analysis of cell extracts (Figure 1c). The structure of 2HG is close to αKG, the product of the IDH1 enzyme. Thus, the sole metabolite identified by untargeted metabolite profiling to be markedly altered by R132H mutant IDH1 expression was also implicated by its structure to be IDHl-related.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Cells expressing human R132H IDH1 contain dramatically elevated levels of 2HG The accumulation of 2HG was not restricted to cell extracts as 2HG was found to rapidly accumulate in the medium of cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 (Figure 1d). No appreciable 2HG could be found in the medium of wild-type cells or cells transfected with wild-type IDH1 (Figure 1d). Isotope-labeling experiments on whole cells using uniformly labeled 13C-glutamine as a culture media nutrient demonstrated that the carbons in 2HG are derived from glutamine, with reasonably high overall pathway flux from glutamine through glutamate and αKG to 2HG. Moreover, labeling experiments did not demonstrate any other major alterations in central carbon metabolic flux in cells expressing R132H mutant 2HG (data not shown). The presence of a myc epitope tag did not alter activity of R132H mutant IDH1. Despite being expressed at lower levels than the myc-tagged R132H IDH1, cells transfected with untagged R132H IDH1 demonstrated a comparable increase in 2HG production (Supplementary Figure 1). To determine whether 2HG production in cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 is unique to U87MG cells, we stably expressed wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 in wild-type IDHl-expressing LN-18 glioblastoma cells (Supplementary Figure 2a). Similar to results obtained with U87MG cells, the major difference in metabolite levels observed in LN-18 cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 was an increased level of 2HG (Supplementary Figure 2b).  Go to: Mutant IDH1 directly converts αKG to 2HG The R132H mutation has been reported to result in loss of function for enzyme activity3, 7. However, in these studies only the NADP+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to αKG was assessed. To understand how IDH1 activity is altered in cells by the presence of R132H mutant IDH1, we expressed increasing amounts of wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 separately or in combination and assessed isocitrate-dependent NADPH production and αKG-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates. Consistent with published results, expression of R132H mutant IDH1 resulted in no measurable production of NADPH from isocitrate, and isocitrate-dependent NADPH production increased with increasing amounts of wild-type enzyme (Supplementary Figure 3a, b). The ability of the wild-type enzyme to generate NADPH was decreased slightly by co-expression of the R132H mutant IDH1. Opposite results were obtained, however, when NADPH consumption was measured in the presence of αKG. NADPH consumption by wild-type enzyme was not observed, while R132H mutant IDH1 expression resulted in αKG-dependent NADPH consumption (Supplementary Figure 3c). Although the overall consumption of NADPH was slow, if anything co-expression of wild-type IDH1 with R132H mutant IDH1 facilitated the αKG-dependent consumption of NADPH. These findings demonstrate that in contrast to wild-type IDH1, R132H mutant IDH1 promotes an NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG. Furthermore, as this reduction was not inhibited by co-expression of wild-type IDH1, these data suggest that the novel activity of mutant IDH1 can persist even in the presence of a wild-type IDH1 allele. In fact, it is possible that in the case of a heterodimer of wild-type and mutant IDH1, the αKG and NADPH produced locally by the wild-type subunit could be used as substrates for the mutant subunit explaining the decrease in NADPH production observed in lysates when wild-type and mutant IDH1 are co-expressed.  To understand how R132 mutations alter the enzymatic properties of IDH1, wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 proteins were produced and purified from E coli. When NADP+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate was measured using purified wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1 protein, it was confirmed that R132H mutation impairs the ability of IDH1 to catalyze this reaction3, 7, as evident by the loss in binding affinity for both isocitrate and MgCl2 along with a 1000-fold decrease in catalytic turnover (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 4a). In contrast, when NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG was assessed using either wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1 protein, only R132H mutant could catalyze this reaction (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 4b). Part of this increased rate of αKG reduction results from an apparent increase in affinity for both the cofactor NADPH and substrate αKG in the R132H mutant IDH1 (Figure 2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that while the R132H mutation leads to a loss of enzymatic function for oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, this mutation also results in a gain of enzyme function for the NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG.  Figure 2 Figure 2 R132H mutation alters the enzymatic properties of IDH1 Reduction of the α-ketone in αKG can result in 2HG. To determine whether R132H mutant protein directly produced 2HG from αKG we examined the product of the mutant IDH1 reaction using negative ion mode triple quadrupole electrospray LC-MS. These experiments confirmed that 2HG was the direct product of NADPH-dependent αKG reduction by the purified R132H mutant protein through comparison with known metabolite standards (Figure 3a). Conversion of αKG to isocitrate was not observed. To determine the chirality of the 2HG produced, we derivatized the products of the R132H reaction with diacetyl-L-tartaric anhydride, which allowed us to separate the (S) and (R) enantiomers of 2HG by simple reverse-phase LC and detect the products by tandem mass spectrometry 9 (Figure 3b). The peaks corresponding to the (S) and (R) isomers of 2HG were confirmed using racemic and R(−)-2HG standards. The reaction product from R132H co-eluted with R(−)-2HG peak, demonstrating that the R(−) stereoisomer is the product produced from αKG by R132H mutant IDH1.  Figure 3 Figure 3 R132H mutation in IDH1 results in production of R(−)-2HG To determine whether the altered enzyme properties resulting from R132H mutation were shared by other R132 mutations found in human gliomas, recombinant R132C, R132L and R132S mutant IDH1 proteins were generated and the enzymatic properties assessed. Similar to R132H mutant protein, R132C, R132L, and R132S mutations all result in a gain-of-function for NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG (Supplementary Figure 4). Thus, in addition to impaired oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, one common feature shared among the IDH1 mutations found in human gliomas is the ability to catalyze direct NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG.  Go to: Structural studies revealed a distinct active site of R132H mutant IDH1 To define how R132 mutations alter the enzymatic properties of IDH1, the crystal structure of R132H mutant IDH1 bound to αKG, NADPH, and Ca2+ was solved at 2.1 Å resolution (see Supplementary Table 1 for crystallographic data and refinement statistics). The overall quaternary structure of the homodimeric R132H mutant enzyme adopts the same closed catalytically competent conformation (shown as a monomer in Figure 4a) that has been previously described for the wild-type enzyme 10.  Figure 4Figure 4 Figure 4 Structural analysis of R132H mutant IDH1 Two important features were noted by the change of R132 to histidine: the effect on conformation equilibrium and the reorganization of the active-site. Located atop a β-sheet in the relatively rigid small domain, R132 acts as a gate-keeper residue and appears to orchestrate the hinge movement between the open and closed conformations. The guanidinium moiety of R132 swings from the open to the closed conformation with a distance of nearly 8 Å. Substitution of histidine for arginine is likely to change the equilibrium in favor of the closed conformation that forms the catalytic cleft for cofactor and substrate to bind efficiently, which partly explains the high-affinity for NADPH exhibited by the R132H mutant enzyme. This feature may be advantageous for the NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG to R(−)-2HG in an environment where NADPH concentrations are low. Secondly, closer examination of the catalytic pocket of the mutant IDH1 structure in comparison to the wild-type enzyme showed not only the expected loss of key salt-bridge interactions between the guanidinium of R132 and the α/β carboxylates of isocitrate, as well as changes in the network that coordinates the metal ion, but also an unexpected reorganization of the active-site. Mutation to histidine resulted in a significant shift in position of the highly conserved residues Y139 from the A subunit and K212′ from the B subunit (Figures 4b & c), both of which are thought to be critical for catalysis by this enzyme family11. In particular, the hydroxyl moiety of Y139 now occupies the space of the β-carboxylate of isocitrate.  The electron density in the active site was not sufficient to assign αKG and its orientation unambiguously. We have modeled the substrate based on the available electron density, taking into consideration the coordination between the carbonyl oxygen of αKG and the calcium ion as well as an orientation of αKG that would produce R(−)-2HG, the experimental product. The model required a significant repositioning of αKG compared to isocitrate, such that the distal carboxylate of αKG now points upward to make new contacts with N96 and S94. Overall, this single R132H mutation results in formation of a distinct active site compared to wild-type IDH1.  Go to: 2HG levels are elevated in human glioma samples Our data demonstrate that mutation of R132 can result in the ability of IDH1 to generate R(−)-2HG from αKG. To determine if 2HG production is characteristic of tumors harboring mutations in IDH1, metabolites were extracted from human malignant gliomas that were either wild-type or mutant for IDH1 (see Supplementary Table 2 for summary of tumor characteristics). It has been suggested that αKG levels are decreased in cells transfected with mutant IDH17. We observe that the average αKG level from 12 tumor samples harboring various R132 mutations was slightly less than the average αKG level observed in 10 tumors which are wild-type for IDH1. This difference in αKG was not statistically significant, and a range of αKG levels was observed in both wild-type and mutant tumors (Figure 5). Similarly, a range of levels was observed for other proximal TCA cycle metabolites with no significant differences observed between wild-type IDH1 tumors and tumors with R132 IDH1 mutations. In contrast, increased 2HG levels were found in all tumors that contained an R132 IDH1 mutation (Figure 5, Supplementary Table 2). All R132 mutant IDH1 tumors examined had between 5 and 35 μmol of 2HG per gram of tumor, while tumors with wild-type IDH1 had over 100 fold less 2HG. This increase in 2HG in R132 mutant tumors was statistically significant (p<0.0001). We confirmed that (R)-2HG was the isomer present in tumor samples (data not shown). Together these data establish that the novel enzymatic activity associated with R132 mutations in IDH1 results in the production of 2HG in human brain tumors that harbor these mutations.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Human malignant gliomas containing R132 mutations in IDH1 contain increased concentrations of 2HG Go to: Discussion 2HG is known to accumulate in the inherited metabolic disorder 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. This disease is caused by deficiency in the enzyme 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, which converts 2HG to αKG12. Patients with 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase deficiencies accumulate 2HG in the brain as assessed by MRI and CSF analysis, develop leukoencephalopathy, and have an increased risk of developing brain tumors 13–15.  Furthermore, elevated brain levels of 2HG result in increased ROS levels16, 17, potentially contributing to an increased risk of cancer, and alterations in NADPH metabolism resulting from mutant IDH1 expression could further exacerbate this effect. The ability of 2HG to act as an NMDA receptor agonist may contribute to this effect 16. 2HG may also be toxic to cells by competitively inhibiting glutamate and/or αKG utilizing enzymes. These include transaminases which allow utilization of glutamate nitrogen for amino and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and αKG-dependent prolyl hydroxylases such as those that regulate Hif1α levels. Alterations in Hif1α have been reported to result from mutant IDH1 protein expression 7. Regardless of mechanism, it appears likely that the gain-of-function ability of cells to produce 2HG as a result of R132 mutations in IDH1 contributes to tumorigenesis. Patients with 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency have a high risk of CNS malignancy 15. The ability of mutant IDH1 to directly act on αKG may explain the prevalence of IDH1 mutations in tumors from CNS tissue, which are unique in their high level of glutamate uptake and its ready conversion to αKG in the cytosol18, thereby providing high levels of substrate for 2HG production. Myeloid cells also display a high ability to metabolize glutamine and recently R132 IDH1 mutations have also been described in a subset of AML19. The apparent co-dominance of the activity of mutant IDH1 with that of the wild-type enzyme is consistent with the genetics of the disease, in which only a single copy of the gene is mutated. As discussed above, the wild-type IDH1 could directly provide NADPH and αKG to the mutant enzyme. These data also demonstrate that mutation of R132 to histidine, serine, cysteine, glycine, or leucine share a common ability to catalyze the NADPH-dependent conversion of αKG to 2HG. These findings help clarify why mutations at other amino acid residues of IDH1, including other residues essential for catalytic activity, are not found. Finally, these findings have clinical implications in that they suggest that 2HG production will identify patients with IDH1 mutant brain tumors. This will be important for prognosis as patients with IDH1 mutations live longer than patients with gliomas characterized by other mutations5. In addition, patients with lower grade gliomas may benefit by the therapeutic inhibition of 2HG production. Inhibition of 2HG production by mutant IDH1 might slow or halt conversion of lower grade glioma into lethal secondary glioblastoma, changing the course of the disease.  Go to: Methods Summary R132H, R132C, R132L and R132S mutations were introduced into human IDH1 by standard molecular biology techniques. 293T and human glioma U87MG and LN-18 cell lines were transfected using standard techniques. Protein expression levels were determined by Western blot. Metabolites were extracted from cultured cells and from tissue samples using 80% aqueous methanol (−80°C) as previously reported 8. Metabolite levels in samples were determined by negative mode electrospray LC-MS. For untargeted profiling, extract components were resolved using reverse phase HPLC running and metabolites were detected in ultra-high resolution mode (resolution ~100,000) by accurate mass ion-trap MS, collecting at one scan/second over an m/z range of 110–1100. For targeted evaluation of 2HG, αKG, and other TCA intermediates, extracts were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC system and metabolites detected by triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry, using multiple-reaction monitoring. Enzymatic activity in cell lysates was assessed by following a change in NADPH fluorescence over time in the presence of isocitrate and NADP, or αKG and NADPH. For enzyme assays using recombinant IDH1 enzyme, proteins were purified from E coli using Ni affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Enzymatic activity for recombinant IDH1 protein was assessed by following a change in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm using a stop-flow spectrophotometer. Chirality of 2HG was determined as described previously9. For crystallography studies, purified R132H IDH1 was pre-incubated with NADPH, calcium chloride, and αKG. Crystals were obtained at 20°C by vapor diffusion equilibration using 3 μL drops mixed 2:1 (protein:precipitant) against a well-solution of MES pH 6.5 and PEG 6000. Patient tumor samples were obtained after informed consent as part of a UCLA IRB-approved research protocol, collected by surgical resection, snap frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The IDH1 mutation status of each sample was determined as described previously3.  Go to: Supplemental Methods Cloning, Expression, and Purification of ICDH1 wt and mutants in E coli  The open reading frame (ORF) clone of human isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (cDNA) (IDH1; ref. ID NM_005896) was purchased from Invitrogen in pENTR221 (Carlsbad, CA) and Origene Inc. in pCMV6 (Rockville, MD). To transfect cells with wild-type or mutant IDH1, standard molecular biology mutagenesis techniques were utilized to alter the DNA sequence at base pair 395 of the ORF in pCMV6 to introduce base pair change from guanine to adenine, which resulted in a change in the amino acid code at position 132 from arginine (wt) to histidine (mutant; or R132H), and confirmed by standard DNA sequencing methods. For 293T cell transfection, wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 were subcloned into pCMV-Sport6 with or without a carboxy-terminal Myc-DDK-tag. For stable cell line generation, constructs in pCMV6 were used. For expression in E coli, the coding region was amplified from pENTR221 by PCR using primers designed to add NDEI and XHO1 restrictions sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends respectively. The resultant fragment was cloned into vector pET41a (EMD Biosciences, Madison, Wl) to enable the E coli expression of C-terminus His8-tagged protein. Site directed mutagenesis was performed on the pET41a-ICHD1 plasmid using the QuikChange® MultiSite-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA)to change G395 to A, resulting in the Arg to His mutation. R132C, R132L and R132S mutants were introduced into pET41a-ICHD1 in an analogous way.  Wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in and purified from the E coli Rosetta™ strain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as follows. Cells were grown in LB (20 μg/ml Kanamycin) at 37°C with shaking until OD600 reaches 0.6. The temperature was changed to 18°C and protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to final concentration of 1 mM. After 12–16 hours of IPTG induction, cells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (20mM Tris, pH7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 % glycerol) and disrupted by microfluidation. The 20,000g supernatant was loaded on metal chelate affinity resin (MCAC) equilibrated with Nickel Column Buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH7.4, 500mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and washed for 20 column volumes. Elution from the column was effected by a 20 column-volume linear gradient of 10% to 100% Nickel Column Buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 500 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol) in Nickel Column Buffer A). Fractions containing the protein of interest were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed twice against a 200-volume excess of Gel Filtration Buffer (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris 7.5, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM MnSO4, 10% glycerol), then concentrated to 10 ml using Centricon (Millipore, Billerica, MA) centrifugal concentrators. Purification of active dimers was achieved by applying the concentrated eluent from the MCAC column to a Sephacryl S-200 (GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) column equilibrated with Gel Filtration Buffer and eluting the column with 20 column volumes of the same buffer. Fractions corresponding to the retention time of the dimeric protein were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled for storage at −80°C.  Cell lines and Cell Culture  293T cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagles Medium) with 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected using pCMV-6-based IDH1 constructs in six-well plates with Fugene 6 (Roche) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Parental vector pCMV6 (no insert), pCMV6-wt IDH1 or pCMV6-R132H were transfected into human glioblastoma cell lines (U87MG; LN-18 (ATCC, HTB-14 and CRL-2610; respectively) cultured in DMEM with 10 % fetal bovine serum. Approximately 24 hrs after transfection, the cell cultures were transitioned to medium containing G418 sodium salt at concentrations of either 500 ug/ml (U87MG) or 750 ug/ml (LN-18) to select stable transfectants. Pooled populations of G418 resistant cells were generated and expression of either wild-type IDH1 or R132 IDH1 was confirmed by standard Western blot analysis.  Western blot  For transient transfection experiments in 293T cells, cells were lysed 72 hours after transfection with standard RIPA buffer. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with goat-anti-IDHc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc49996) or rabbit-anti-MYC tag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology #2278) and then detected with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat or HRP-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc2004). IDH1 antibody to confirm expression of both wild-type and R132H IDH1 was obtained from Proteintech. The IDH2 mouse monoclonal antibody used was obtained from Abeam.  Metabolite extraction  48h prior to profiling the appropriate culture medium was changed to identical medium with dialyzed fetal calf serum. All cells were grown in 10 cm tissue culture dishes, and the medium was replaced again with identical medium 24 h and 1h prior to metabolite extraction. All samples were harvested at a non-confluent density (1.5 – 2.0 × 106 cells). Metabolism was quenched and metabolites extracted by aspiration of media and immediate addition of 3.6 mL 80:20 methanol:water at −80°C, and transfer to a dry-ice bed to simultaneously lyse cells and quench metabolism. Cell remnants were scraped from the tissue culture dish and transferred, along with the methanol:water, into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was moved to a new tube. A 1 mL portion of the supernatant was then dried under nitrogen gas, dissolved in 100 μL of aq. LC buffer, spun at 13,000 × g for 10 min to remove any remaining debris and analyzed by LC-MS within 24h, as described below. At the time of harvest, an equivalently treated plate to each of those harvested was used to determine the total cell count, enabling subsequent normalization of LCMS signal intensities between culture dishes.  Non-targeted LC-MS  Samples were analyzed using high resolution (~100,000 fwhm resolution) exact mass ion-trap mass spectrometry in full-scan mode (1 scan/second, set to high dynamic range), coupled to liquid chromatography via negative mode electrospray ionization (−3.0 kV). The scan range was picked to avoid abundant ions like phosphate and sulfate entering the ion trap, and was set as follows: 0–3 min: no scanning, 3–5 min: 85–800 m/z, 5.0–6.7 min: 100–800 m/z, 6.7–9.0 min: 85–800 m/z, 9–16 min: 110–1000 m/z, 16–24 min: 220–1000 m/z. For chromatography, a Synergi Hydro-RP, 100mm × 2 mm, 2.1 μm particle size column was used (Phenomonex, Torrance, CA). Solvent A was 10 mM tributylamine and 15 mM acetic acid in 97% water/3% methanol. Solvent B was methanol. The gradient was (t=0–2.5 min, 0% B; t=5–7.5 min, 20% B; t=13 min, 55% B; t=15.5–18.5 min, 95% B; 19–25 min 0% B). The flow rate was 200 μL/min.  Targeted Liquid Chromatography—Mass Spectrometry, 2HG and TCA metabolite measurements  To detect secreted 2HG in culture media, 500 μL aliquots of conditioned media were collected, mixed 80:20 with methanol, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The resulting supernatant was collected and stored at −80°C prior to LC-MS to assess 2HG levels. To measure whole-cell associated metabolites, media was aspirated and cells were harvested as described above. Two different liquid chromatography (LC) separation methods were used, each coupled by negative electrospray ionization (ESI, −3.0 kV) to triple-quadrupole mass spectrometers operating in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, with MS parameters optimized on infused metabolite standard solutions. In both methods, metabolites were separated by reversed phase chromatography using 10 mM tributyl-amine as an ion pairing agent in the aqueous mobile phase, according to a variant of a previously reported method20. The first method allowed resolution of TCA metabolites: t = 0, 50% B; t = 5, 95% B; t= 7, 95% B; t= 8, 0% B, where B refers to an organic mobile phase of 100% methanol. The second method was specific for 2HG, running a fast linear gradient from 50%–95% B (buffers as defined above) over 5 minutes. In both methods, the column was a Synergi Hydro-RP, 100mm × 2 mm, 2.1 μm particle size (Phenomonex), as above. Metabolites were quantified by comparison of peak areas with pure metabolite standards at known concentration. Metabolite flux studies from 13C-glutamine were performed as described previously21.  Detection of isocitrate, αKG, and 2HG in purified enzyme reactions by LC-MS  Enzyme reactions performed as described in the text were run to completion as judged by measurement of the oxidation state of NADPH at 340 nm. Reactions were extracted with eight volumes of methanol, and centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. The supernatant was dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in H2O. Analysis was conducted on an API2000 LC-MS-MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sample separation and analysis was performed on a 150 × 2 mm, 4 uM Synergi Hydro-RP 80 A column, using a gradient of Buffer A (10 mM tributylamine, 15 mM acetic acid, 3% (v/v) methanol, in water) and Buffer B (methanol) using MRM transitions.  Cell lysates based enzyme assays  293T cell lysates for measuring enzymatic activity were obtained 48 hours after transfection with M-PER lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000g, supernatants were collected and normalized for total protein concentration. To measure IDH oxidative activity, 3 μg of lysate protein was added to 200 μl of an assay solution containing 33 mM Tris-acetate buffer (pH 7.4), 1.3 mM MgCl2, 0.33 mM EDTA, 100 μM β-NADP, and varying concentrations of D-(+)-threo-isocitrate. Absorbance at 340 nm, reflecting NADPH production, was measured every 20 seconds for 30 min on a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), Data points represent the mean activity of 3 replicates per lysate, averaged among 5 time points centered at every 5 min. To measure IDH reductive activity, 3 μg of lysate protein was added to 200 μl of an assay solution which contained 33 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.4, 1.3 mM MgCl2,25 μM β-NADPH, 40 mM NaHCO3, and 0.6 mM αKG. The decrease in 340 nm absorbance over time was measured to assess NADPH consumption, with 3 replicates per lysate.  Recombinant IDH1 Enzyme Assays  All reactions were performed in standard enzyme reaction buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5,10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.03% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). For determination of kinetic parameters, sufficient enzyme was added to give a linear reaction for 1 to 5 seconds. Reaction progress was monitored by observation of the reduction state of the cofactor at 340 nm in an SFM-400 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (BioLogic, Knoxville, TN). Enzymatic constants were determined using curve fitting algorithms to standard kinetic models with the Sigmaplot software package (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).  Determination of chirality of reaction products from enzyme reactions and tumors  Enzyme reactions were run to completion and extracted with methanol as described above, then derivatized with enantiomerically pure tartaric acid before resolution and analysis by LC-MS. After being thoroughly dried, samples were resuspended in freshly prepared 50 mg/ml (2R,3R)-(+)-Tartaric acid in dichloromethane:acetic acid (4:1) and incubated for 30 minutes at 75°C. After cooling to room temperature, samples were briefly centrifuged at 14,000g, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and resuspended in H2O Analysis was conducted on an API200 LC-MS-MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using an isocratic flow of 90:10 (2 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.6:MeOH) on a Luna C18(2) 150 × 2 mm, 5 uM column. Tartaric-acid derivatized 2HG was detected using the 362.9/146.6 MRM transition and the following instrument settings: DP -1, FP -310, EP -4, CE-12, CXP-26. Analysis of the (R)-2HG standard, 2HG racemic mixture, and methanol-extracted tumor biomass (q.v.) was similarly performed. (R)-2HG standard was obtained from Sigma and synthesized internally.  Crystallography  For crystallography studies, purified R132H IDH1 was pre-incubated with NADPH, calcium chloride, and αKG. Crystals were obtained at 20°C by vapor diffusion equilibration of 3 μL drops of mixed 2:1 (protein:precipitant) against a well solution of MES pH 6.5 and PEG 6000. A diffraction dataset with 92% completeness was collected under cryo conditions with 1.08 Å wavelength radiation on an ADSC Quantum 315R detector at Beamline X29A of the NSLS at Brookhaven National Laboratories. The dataset was integrated using HKL2000 and scaled using SCALEPACK22. A single molecular replacement solution was obtained with PHASER23 using published coordinates from wild type IDH1 in the ‘closed’ conformation as search model (PDB accession code 1T0L). Model building was performed using COOT24 and the final model was refined by the CCP4 program REFMAC525; graphics were produced using PyMOL26. Water molecules were selectively modeled into the structure based upon strong spherical electron density difference peaks, having proper coordination geometry and distance, located within the first solvent shell layer, and having B-factors <80 and electron density sigma level >1.0. After the final refinement, 92.4% of residues fit in the most favored regions in the Ramachandran plot, with 6.8% in the additional allowed regions and 0.7% in general allowed regions. The final structure model in the closed form conformation at a resolution of 2.1 Å contains three polypeptide chains of IDH1R132H each chain consisting of 425 amino acids (414 residues plus a C-term His-tag, with residues 4–410 placed into the model), three NADPH molecules, and 301 total waters.  Clinical Specimens, metabolite extraction and analysis  The collection of human brain tumor samples was approved by the UCLA IRB. Human brain tumors were obtained during surgical resection, snap frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Clinical classification and grading of the tissue was performed using standard clinical histopathology as established by the WHO. Genomic sequence analysis was deployed to identify brain tumor samples containing either wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) or mutations altering amino acid 132. Genomic DNA was isolated from 50–100 mgs of brain tumor tissue using standard methods. A polymerase chain reaction on the isolated genomic DNA was used to amplify a 295 base pair fragment of the genomic DNA that contains both the intron and 2nd exon sequences of human IDH1 and mutation status assessed by standard molecular biology techniques.  Metabolite extraction was accomplished by adding a 10× volume (m/v ratio) of −80 C methanol:water mix (80%:20%) to the brain tissue (approximately 100mgs) followed by 30 s homogenization at 4 C. These chilled, methanol extracted homogenized tissues were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 minutes to sediment the cellular and tissue debris and the cleared tissue supernatants were transferred to a screw-cap freezer vial and stored at −80°C. For analysis, a 2× volume of tributylamine (10 mM) acetic acid (10 mM) pH 5.5 was added to the samples and analyzed by LCMS as follows. Sample extracts were filtered using a Millex-FG 0.20 micron disk and 10 μl were injected onto a reverse-phase HPLC column (Synergi 150mm × 2 mm, Phenomenex Inc.) and eluted using a linear gradient LC-MS-grade methanol (50%) with 10 mM tributylamine and 10 mM acetic acid) ramping to 80 % methanohl:10 mM tributylamine: 10 mM acetic acid over 6 minutes at 200 μL/min. Eluted metabolite ions were detected using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer, tuned to detect in negative mode with multiple-reaction-monitoring mode transition set according to the molecular weights and fragmentation patterns for 8 known central metabolites, including 2-hydroxyglutarate as described above. Data was processed using Analyst Software (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and metabolite signal intensities were obtained by standard peak integration methods.  
1766||Cellular metabolism and cancer Discussions on cancer genetics invariably evoke the six hallmarks of cancer proposed by Hanahan and Weinberg in their landmark review article [1]. Although no single genetic aberration is common to all cancer types, a switch to aerobic glycolysis is common to nearly all proliferating cancer cells regardless of their cell of origin, an idea proposed by Otto Warburg 80 years ago. In light of this, many researchers propose that an alteration in cellular metabolism should be considered the seventh hallmark of cancer 2; 3 ;  4.  Central to Warburg's argument was the theory that the irreversible impairment of cellular respiration causes cancer. Although current data suggest that the mitochondria in most cancer cells are not damaged in terms of energy production, they are intimately linked to cancer processes 3 ;  5. This is not surprising considering many of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are important for the synthesis of nucleotides, lipids and amino acids, all of which are necessary for cells to proliferate and self-replicate. In fact, mutations in three different enzymes associated with the TCA cycle have been reported in cancer. These mutations can predispose cells to neoplasia either by activating driver oncogenes or by eliminating tumor-suppressor genes. Two enzymes in the TCA cycle are bone fide tumor suppressors: succinate dehydrogenase, the mutation of which associates with paraganglioma and phaeochromocytoma, and fumarate hydratase, the mutation of which associates with renal carcinoma and leiomyomatosis 5 ;  6. The third enzyme associated with the TCA cycle that is mutated in cancer is IDH, which was recently discovered in gliomas and AML. A subsequent wave of studies from around the globe have reported mutations in two isoforms of this enzyme, IDH1 and IDH2, raising the level of excitement in the basic and clinical research community for these diseases as well as the hope for novel therapeutics. Here, we review the IDH mutations that have been found in tumors and the associated alterations in the biochemistry of IDH. We also attempt to reconcile divergent views on the possible mechanisms of cancer promotion and proliferation owing to IDH mutations. Lastly, we discuss the opportunity and considerations in the development of therapeutics in the treatment of IDH-mutated diseases.  IDH mutations in brain tumors Gliomas are the most common form of brain tumor. According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) classification criteria (Table 1), grade I gliomas are considered benign, whereas grade II (low-grade diffuse astrocytomas) or grade III (anaplastic astrocytomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas) are invasive tumors and often progress to malignant glioblastoma (grade IV). Grade IV gliomas, including primary and secondary GBM, are among the most lethal cancers with a median survival of only a year, and are, unfortunately, also the most prevalent forms of brain tumors [7].  Table 1. WHO grading classification of major brain tumors. Brain Cancer Type	WHO grade I	II	III	IV AstrocyticTumors Pilocytic Astrocytoma	X			 Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma	X			 Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma		X		 Diffuse Astrocytoma		X		 Anaplastic Astrocytoma			X	 Glioblastoma (Primary or Secondary)				X Giant Cell Glioblastoma				X Gliosarcoma				X  Oligodendroglial Tumors	X			 Oligodendroglioma		X		 Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma				  Oligoastrocytic Tumors Oligoastrocytoma		X		 Anaplastic Oligoastrocytoma			X	 The three most common brain cancer subtypes relevant to IDH mutation are shown with disease grade classification. Both primary and secondary GBM are grade IV tumors. The clinical distinction is that primary GBM are classified as grade IV upon diagnosis without any history of low-grade disease, whereas secondary GBM have prior evidence of grade II and III disease. Adapted from the most recent edition of WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System [84].  Table options Although histologically indistinguishable at diagnosis, primary and secondary GBM constitute two distinct disease subtypes that develop via different pathways exemplified by different genetic lesions and affect patients of different age groups 8 ;  9. In population-wide studies, the majority of GBM (>90%) are primary GBM that are diagnosed as grade IV advanced tumors without any clinical, radiological or histological evidence of low-grade lesions; therefore, primary GBM are often referred to as de novo GBM. Primary GBM often occur in older patient populations; the median age at diagnosis is 62 years, which differs significantly from the distribution of secondary GBM patients in which the median age at diagnosis is 45 years 10 ;  11. Although primary GBM are full blown tumors at diagnosis, these tumors probably develop undetected for some time. There are several known genetic lesions that occur in both primary and secondary GBM such as the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the q arm of chromosome 10 and p16INK4a deletion [12]. However, primary but not secondary GBM associate with LOH at 10p; furthermore, primary GBM often associate with the loss of the entirety of chromosome 10 [13], epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutation [9].  By contrast, secondary GBM more often associate with the TP53 mutation [12], where it is also found in low-grade subtypes (astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas), which are early glioma stages that can develop into secondary GBM, suggesting that the TP53 mutation is a relatively early event in the progression of this disease. Despite the association of GBM with specific oncogenic alterations, these are not sufficient to clearly distinguish clinically distinct subtypes. Moreover, despite some knowledge of specific genetic alterations, the application of targeted therapies against discrete pathways has met with little success [14]. As a result, the standard of care remains surgical tumor resection followed by chemotherapy with the oral alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy [15].  In an effort to better define diagnostic and prognostic subtypes of gliomas and identify oncogenic alterations that can provide new therapeutic opportunities for treating GBM, Parsons and colleagues systematically sequenced 20 661 protein coding genes, or about two-thirds of the human genome, for 22 human GBM samples [16]. A surprisingly large and varied number of candidate genes not previously associated with GBM were identified; however, the discovery of the recurrent mutation of IDH1 on chromosome 2q33 at a frequency of about 12% was the most notable. Importantly, mutations in IDH1 were heterozygous point mutations leading to the substitution of histidine (H) or serine (S) at R132 ( Figure 1).  Full-size image (68 K) Figure 1.  IDHmutation hot spots. Primary protein architecture of IDH1, IDH2 and IDH3 subunits are shown with catalytic subunits in blue and regulatory subunits in red. NADP+-dependent IDH1 and IDH2 function as homodimeric proteins, whereas the NAD+-dependent IDH3 functions as a heterotetrameric protein composed of two α, one β and one γ subunits. Reported somatic mutations are shown as green triangles at specific residues of IDH1 and IDH2. No mutation has been reported for IDH3. Abbreviation: aa, amino acids. Figure options The report from Parsons and colleagues proved to be only the tip of the iceberg for IDH tumor biology, as numerous subsequent studies have confirmed and expanded the findings; larger sets of human glioma samples have even higher frequencies (up to 70%) of the IDH mutation and IDH mutations are specific to glioma lineages that constitute secondary GBM [17]. In one study, 221 somatic IDH1 mutations were identified by sequencing DNA from 685 brain tumor samples [18]. Importantly, IDH1 mutations occur at high frequencies in grade II gliomas, namely diffuse astrocytomas (68%), oligodendromas (69%) and oligoastrocytomas (78%), and with a similarly high frequency in all types of advanced grade IV secondary GBM (88%), suggesting that the IDH1 mutation is an early event in the oncogenesis of secondary GBM.  But how early is the acquisition of the IDH mutation in the process of glioma progression relative to other reported genetic lesions? The TP53 mutation also stably associates with gliomas from low-grade diffuse astrocytomas through to high-grade GBM [19]. TP53 encodes the p53 tumor suppressor that regulates cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair and genome stability, and mutations in this pathway often lead to cancer development and poor outcome [20]. IDH1 mutations (interestingly, all cysteine [C] substitutions at R132) co-occur with TP53 mutations in the astrocytomas of patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, who carry germ-line TP53 mutations [21]. Serial analyses of multiple biopsies from the 51 patients collected over time show that in all cases the IDH1 mutation precedes the acquisition of the TP53 mutation [22], suggesting that the IDH1 mutation can participate in the transformation of common glial precursor cells.  The analysis of 939 samples of central nervous system (CNS) tumors and nonCNS tumors confirmed the prevalence of IDH1 mutations (70% overall) in grade II, grade III and grade IV secondary GBM. Interestingly, some of the tumors that do not have the IDH1 mutation instead harbor the IDH2 mutation at the R132 equivalent codon (R172) [23]. Again no IDH mutations were found in either non-CNS tumors or benign grade I pylocytic astrocytomas, which is a distinct glioma subtype carrying a duplication at chromosome 7q34 that results in BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion [24]. An even larger independent study of 1010 diffuse gliomas confirmed these findings [25]. One striking observation in these studies is that mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are mutually exclusive, suggesting that the mutation of either isoform is sufficient to confer growth and survival advantages. This underscores the idea that IDH lesions produce a gain of function for tumor formation.  It is also interesting to note that IDH1 mutation consistently associates with better prognosis among the grade IV glioma subgroups [26], and this correlation holds true particularly for younger adult low-grade astrocytoma patients harboring IDH mutations [15]. This prognostic difference is statistically significant even when corrected for age differences and other variables in Cox proportional models [17]. It should be noted that IDH mutations have been found exclusively in only adults thus far and not in pediatric patients of similar tumor types. One possible explanation for the improved survival for patients harboring gain-of-function IDH mutations could be the reduction of intracellular pools of NADPH, which can then sensitize glioma cells to chemotherapy or radiation therapy [27]. Although the hypothesis that the loss of this important cofactor protects cells from oxidative damage is appealingly logical, it is unlikely to be the complete story. In fact, retrospective analysis shows that IDH1 mutational status has no statistical impact on the response rate to TMZ therapy [15]. Despite differing opinions about the role IDH mutations play in gliomas, one aspect that all researchers can agree on is that the combined high frequency of IDH mutations in secondary GBM and its virtual absence in primary GBM makes mutated IDH proteins (or elevated 2HG levels) the most specific biomarkers to date in the diagnostic classification of secondary GBM. Although IDH mutations in primary GBM are a rare event, when nonsupervised gene expression studies have been conducted, primary GBM samples harboring the IDH mutant have shared similar expression profiles with the more prevalent secondary GBM, suggesting that IDH mutation status can be an independent molecular marker [28].  In summary, heterozygous mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 found in a majority of low-grade and secondary GBM seem to be early genetic lesions that contribute to the development of a molecularly distinct subtype of brain tumors.  IDH mutations in AML AML is a clonal malignant neoplasia of hematopoietic origin characterized by genomic lesions of myeloid precursors, which fail to mature and accumulate as blasts in the bone marrow. AML is heterogeneous in terms of tumor biology, clinical presentation and response to treatment. Approximately half of AML cases have cytogenetic abnormalities, and those with normal cytogenetics have other underlying somatic mutations [29]. Although morphological assessment and karyotyping remain the gold standard for the classification of AML and predicting disease outcome, our understanding of the genetics of AML has advanced; the mutational status of nucleophosmin (NPM1), FMS-related tyrosine kinase (FLT3) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) have been recently incorporated into the WHO classification system, improving stratification and treatment strategies for patients with normal cytogenetic profiles [30].  To identify genetic mutations associated with the pathogenesis of AML, Mardis and colleagues recently reported the entire genome sequence of leukemic cells from a single de novo AML patient with normal cytogenetics compared with the genome sequence from normal skin cells from the same patient [31]. Although 750 possible somatic mutations were identified, only a handful of genes were recurrently mutated in multiple AML genomes—a good indicator that a mutation contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. One of these genes is IDH1 (the others are NRAS and NPM1). Mutated IDH1 strongly associates with normal cytogenetic profiles with a frequency of 16% in this subpopulation. Building on this result, several groups have now confirmed the significant recurrence of the IDH1 mutation through targeted sequencing ( Table 2). They report heterozygous R132 mutations in 5.5% of 493 cases of de novo AML patients and 10.9% of 275 cytogenetic normal AML patients 32 ;  33. Interestingly, this genetic aberrance is rare in pediatric AML [34].  Table 2.

IDH mutations found in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database are tumor cell lines of the stated cancer type.  Table options In contrast to secondary GBM, the mutational status of IDH1 or IDH2 might correlate with poorer prognosis in specific subtypes of cytogenetically normal AML. In the large study of 531 AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), IDH1 mutation seems to have no impact on overall survival rates or relapse-free survival [34]. Yet, in a Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study of 358 patients in which 33% harbored either the IDH1 or IDH2 mutation, when stratified by age group and only younger patients (< 60 yrs) with the NMP1 mutation and FLT3-ITD-negative status were analyzed, patients with IDH1 mutations had significantly worse disease-free survival and trended towards worse overall survival [35]. Although patients with the IDH2 mutation with R140Q had no differences in disease outcome, older patients with the R172K IDH2 mutation had lower complete remission rates than the age-matched IDH2 wild-type group (38% versus 75%) in the same study. Expanding on this finding, the German–Austrian AML Study Group (AMLSG) study of 805 adults showed 129 patients (16%) harbor either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations where IDH status confers a poorer prognosis, especially when factoring in mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD [36]. However, in a recent study of 272 AML patients with a normal karyotype, IDH2 mutation status alone or in combination with IDH1 mutations had no impact on response to therapy, overall survival and relapse-free survival [37]. Intriguingly, an IDH single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the same exon as the R132 mutation is found in about 12% of cytogenetically normal AML, a frequency similar to normal subject controls but strikingly associated with significantly worse survival [32]. Based on all the AML data to date, there is yet to be agreement on whether IDH mutation defines a distinct AML subtype with distinct disease progression.  In addition to primary AML, IDH mutations are also found in secondary AML (sAML) cases that result from the progression of other related myeloproliferative diseases, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), which raises the question of whether IDH mutations are also found in MDS and MPN 29; 38 ;  39. In a relatively well-defined MDS population of 86 patients with del(5q), IDH mutations occur at significantly higher frequency in high-risk MDS or sAML compared with the low-risk group (22% versus 0%) [40]. Mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 were also frequently detected in blast-phase MPN (21%) and less frequently in chronic-phase MPN of about 4% of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) cases, and none were found in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET) [41]. To better define IDH mutation status across different disease stages of specific MPN subtypes, a collaborative study of 1473 MPN patients showed that IDH mutations do occur in chronic-phase ET, PV or PMF, as well as in post-PV/ET myelofibrosis, but at a very low frequency [42]. This large study confirmed IDH mutations at a high frequency in blast-phase disease (31%). These studies collectively suggest that IDH mutants contribute to the leukemic transformation of MDS and MPN. Importantly, IDH mutations are not mutually exclusive with other well-known genetic mutations of MDS, MPN and AML, suggesting that although IDH mutation might arise early in the disease course, it might drive disease progression rather than initiation—an important consideration for therapeutic development.  Biochemistry of mutant IDH IDH is a member of the β-decarboxylating dehydrogenase family of enzymes and catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of 2R,3S-isocitrate to yield 2-oxoglutarate (α-KG) and carbon dioxide in the TCA cycle. There are three isoforms of IDH: IDH1 and IDH2 are homodimers each with two identical active sites per homodimer, whereas IDH3 is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two alpha subunits, which contain the two active sites, together with two regulatory subunits, beta and gamma (Figure 1). IDH3 catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to α-KG in the mitochondria, producing one equivalent of NADH in a NAD+-dependent reaction. By contrast, IDH1 and IDH2 are NADP+-dependent enzymes and one of three enzyme families that produce NADPH, an important cofactor necessary for nucleotide and fatty acid biosynthesis and essential for cellular antioxidant activity. The main feature that distinguishes IDH1 from IDH2 is subcellular localization; IDH1 is in the cytoplasm and peroxisomes, whereas IDH2 exclusively localizes to the mitochondria [43]. It is interesting that mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 but not IDH3 are found in cancer. This could point to the importance of mitochondrial function and altered cellular redox potential via limiting the pool of NADPH as the underlying contribution of IDH mutation to tumorigenesis.  IDH enzymes are positively and negatively regulated by ADP and ATP through allosteric binding, respectively [44]. IDH2 is acetylated at two lysines [45], although it is not clear how acetylation affects IDH biological functions. As with most metabolic enzymes, the activities of IDH1 and IDH2 are generally regulated in normal cells by the availability of substrate and cofactors. One key feature of this kinetic regulatory mechanism is the directionality of the enzyme's activity in vitro. The standard free energy change for the conversion of isocitrate to α-KG is –8.4 kilojoules (kJ)/mol or about –2.0 kilocalories (kcal)/mol [46]. This reaction is thereby spontaneous and is driven by the reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H. Owing to this large negative free energy change, at least in vitro, IDH catalyzes one of the few irreversible reactions in the TCA cycle. However, in tumor-associated mutated versions of IDH1 or IDH2, the active site mutations can override this kinetic regulatory mechanism and, in fact, mutant IDH gains the ability to carry out the reverse reaction 47 ;  48.  Structural studies and energetic arguments can explain how mutated IDH enzymes gain new activity, namely the reduction of α-KG to a new metabolite R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG; Box 1) via the conversion of NADPH to NADP+. In X-ray structural studies relevant to inhibitor design, the wild-type enzyme consists of two domains: a smaller domain that is similar to the common Rossmann fold found in many dehydrogenases and a larger domain associated with two sets of antiparallel beta sheets forming a hinge region 47 ;  49. During the two-step catalysis to affect the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-KG, IDH adopts a ‘closed’ conformation and the magnesium (Mg2+)–isocitrate substrate complex binds between the large and small domains of the enzyme [49]. NADP+ binds to the interdomain cleft, which is positioned for stereospecific hydride transfer. Two groups of key residues forming the active sites are worth noting. First, the two essential catalytic residues in IDH1, tyrosine (Y) 140 and lysine (K) 212’ (from chain B), are thought to participate in the acid-base catalysis during the decarboxylation of isocitrate and are highly conserved within this family of oxidoreductase enzymes [50]. In R132-mutated IDH1, both of these residues appear to shift out of position relative to the wild-type enzyme; the hydroxyl moiety of Y140 now occupies the space that the β-carboxylic acid of isocitrate would normally occupy. Second, a triad of arginines (in IDH1 R100, R109 and R132 and in IDH2 R140, R149 and R172) in the Mg2+–isocitrate substrate complex recognition site form a salt-bridge with the substrate (Figure 2).  Box 1.  Stereoisomers of 2HG.  Following the catalytic reduction of α-KG by IDH via the conversion of NADPH to NADP+, the specific orientation by which hydride transfer takes place in the IDH active site results in the production of the R(-) enantiomer of 2HG. In this case, R(-) is equivalent to “D” and S(+) is equivalent to “L” (Figure I).  Stereoisomers of 2HG. Representations of the stereoisomers of 2HG as S- and ... Figure I.  Stereoisomers of 2HG.

Cancer-associatedIDHmutations occur in or near the enzyme's active site. a) The crystal structure of the IDH1 R132H mutant enzyme. Mutant IDH2 is predicted to share the same active site organization as IDH1 because the residues around the active site are conserved. b) A close-up view of the IDH active site. The location of mutated residues in IDH1 and IDH2 are noted and illustrated as space-fill atoms. Figure options The IDH mutations identified in gliomas and AML alter the amino acid residues R132 in IDH1 and either R172 or R140 in IDH2 ( Figure 1). It seems that the position of the mutation rather than the identity of the substituted amino acid affects IDH activity and confers an advantage to cancer cells with IDH mutations. In the case of IDH1, substitutions at R132 vary from C to glycine (G) and in the case of IDH2, R172 substitutions include K, methionine (M), tryptophan (W) and G 23 ;  25 (Table 2). Although there are no apparent common chemical properties conserved among the side chain substitutions, the mutated enzymes have in common i) a loss of function in the forward reaction that decarboxylates isocitrate via the conversion of NADP+ to NADPH [51] and ii) a gain of function in the reverse reaction that reduces α-KG to 2HG via the conversion of NADPH to NADP+[47]. The loss of function is accompanied by the loss of affinity for the Mg2+–isocitrate substrate complex, whereas the gain of function is accompanied by the gain in affinity for NADPH, which now kinetically favors the reverse reductive reaction (Figure 3).  Full-size image (119 K) Figure 3.  The role of IDH in cancer metabolism of gliomas and AML. Enzymes of the TCA cycle in the mitochondria and mutated IDH in the cytosol are represented. The hypothesis of how 2HG produced by mutated IDH might act through the accumulation of HIF1α via PHD inhibition leading to cancer development is shown schematically. Abbreviations: FH, fumarate hydratase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase; GLS, glutaminase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; G6P glucose 6-phosphate. Figure options Both loss- and gain-of-function reactions have significant implications for cellular metabolism in these cancer cells. Intriguingly, this new reverse reaction reduces α-KG only to 2HG, but not any further (i.e. full reductive carboxylation to reform isocitrate is not detected). From an energetics point of view, classical carboxylation reactions are often coupled to ATP hydrolysis to overcome an energy barrier that makes the reaction highly unfavorable, for example carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle. But in the mitochondria, the reverse reaction could be achieved by the excess availability of NADPH supplied by the H+-transhydrogenase driven by the proton electrochemical gradient as demonstrated in rat livers perfused with 13C5-labeled glutamine and glutamate [52]. Therefore, in cancer cells cytosolic mutated IDH1 could be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, whereas mitochondrial mutated IDH2 might be coupled to H+-transhydrogenase. Either mechanism would then allow IDH to efficiently fix carbon to produce isocitrate from α-KG. Indeed, in proliferating cancer cells wild-type IDH2 can convert α-KG to isocitrate in the mitochondria via reductive carboxylation as demonstrated by the production of 13C-labeled isocitrate in whole cells that were fed 13C-labeled L-glutamine [53]. Nonetheless, in virtually all samples analyzed thus far, tumors harboring IDH1 (at R132) or IDH2 mutations (at R172 or R140) produce elevated levels of 2HG rather than isocitrate 47; 48 ;  53. To date, there have been no reports of false positives.  It is worth noting that there are additional mutations at other residues of IDH1, for example valine 71 to isoleucine (V71I) and G123R in anaplastic thyroid cancer [54] (Table 2). The functions of these altered enzymes have not been characterized biochemically. It will be interesting to determine whether these also gain the ability to produce 2HG from α-KG.  A prominent and common feature of tumors harboring various IDH mutations is the elevated levels of 2HG [47]. Exploiting this simple fact, two contemporary and independent studies screened for IDH mutations in AML samples by quantifying 2HG levels by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and the samples with high levels of 2HG were genotyped 48 ;  53. They confirmed a recurrent IDH1 mutation but also uncovered several mutations in IDH2. Again, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 were mutually exclusive, with rare exceptions [36]. In contrast to gliomas, however, where IDH1 mutations are most common, IDH2 mutations were more prevalent in AML, suggesting potentially different metabolic and oncogenic mechanisms can be at play for gliomas versus AML. More surprisingly, all five IDH2 mutations found in one data set contained a previously characterized glutamine (Q) substitution at position 140 [53]. This residue is equivalent to R100 in IDH1 and is one of the triad of arginines that are important for isocitrate–Mg2+ binding (Figure 2). In structural modeling exercises, the R140Q mutation is predicted to orient α-KG for the reductive synthesis of R(-)2HG in a similar manner to the IDH1 R132 mutant (Box 1). Thus, beyond furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of AML subtypes, these two studies also demonstrated the power of 2HG as a biomarker to identify tumors harboring various IDH1 and IDH2 mutant isoforms. In short, the biochemistry of mutant IDH exemplifies the resourcefulness of cancer cells to evolve and to adapt this TCA cycle enzyme, catalyzing the reverse direction in an orthogonal fashion to produce the oncometabolite 2HG.  Oncogenic hypotheses The first clue to how IDH mutations might act in cancer came from the observation that these were all mono-allelic heterozygous rather than bi-allelic homozygous mutations, raising the point for debate of whether a single-allelic heterozygous mutation can be classified as a tumor suppressor rather than a classic oncogene [55]. With the exception of rare genes that exhibit haploinsufficiency, tumor suppressors classically obey the two-hit hypothesis put forth by Knudson based on his insightful statistical study of retinoblastomas [56]. This is because canonical tumor suppressors act in a recessive manner, because one normal copy is sufficient to control cellular growth, and therefore, both alleles must be lost or inactivated to promote tumorigenesis. By contrast, the conversion of a proto-oncogene into an oncogene generally involves a gain-of-function alteration in a dominant fashion where the mutation of one allele is sufficient to promote tumor development. For IDH, supporting evidence exists for both cases. Initial mechanism-of-action studies have proposed that IDH1 represents a tumor-suppressor gene because the point mutation leads to the loss-of-function of the enzyme in the forward conversion of isocitrate to α-KG. Zhao and colleagues provided crystallography and cellular overexpression evidence that the inactivated enzyme acts in a dominant negative manner to suppress the wild-type enzyme from the nonmutated allele [51]. By contrast, the evidence supporting the counter argument that IDH is a proto-oncogene comes from the finding that the mutant enzyme gains the ability to produce 2HG from α-KG at extraordinarily high levels in specific tumors 47 ;  48. This was true for a variety of point mutations in either IDH1 or IDH2 despite the fact that the cellular localization of IDH1 and IDH2 differ and there can be differences in their downstream oncogenic effects.  Whether this is a case of oncogenic driver mutation or passenger gene mutation will not be definitively resolved without in vivo proof-of-concept studies. But current evidence favors the former. Primarily, the convergence of the varied heterozygous IDH mutants in both AML and GBM, two very distinct diseases, to identically produce 2HG lends credence to the argument that these are driver oncogenes. If true, this genetic lesion must occur as an early event in the pathogenesis of AML or GBM, and moreover it must also remain stable throughout disease progression. As such, it begs the question of whether IDH mutations in AML share common oncogenic mechanisms to secondary GBM. For one, the AML case shares important similarities to GBM in that IDH mutation already exists in several related precursor diseases often antecedent to the development of AML, parallel to the case of low-grade gliomas that progress to become secondary GBM maintaining the IDH mutation throughout disease progression. In addition to primary AML, recurrent IDH1 were found in 5–10% of sAML, MDS and MPN 29; 38 ;  57. MDS and MPN are also clonal proliferative blood disorders affecting the bone marrow and share many of the common cytogenetic and somatic alterations found in primary AML. MDS is characterized by neoplastic myeloid precursor cells that when sufficient or appropriate genomic lesions have been accumulated can variably progress to sAML—a process of transformation that is poorly understood. Importantly, in a recent large AML study, IDH mutational status was serially analyzed in 130 patients during disease progression, and in this data set 18 patients had IDH genetic lesions at diagnosis [33]. Remarkably, IDH1 mutation was undetectable at complete remission in all 18 patients, and nine out of 11 patients regained the mutation at relapse; no patients with wild-type IDH at diagnosis acquired the mutation after relapse. These data suggest that IDH mutations are early events that remain stable throughout the disease development of AML. The association of IDH mutations with this family of interrelated but heterogeneous set of diseases with the highest frequency found in advanced stages is most consistent with the driver oncogene hypothesis in the pathogenesis of these cancers.  How exactly the production of 2HG by mutant IDH drives cancer development is not well understood. Somatic mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 lead to the production of 2HG, but there are rare cases where 2HG could abnormally accumulate without IDH mutation. Patients with L-2HG aciduria (L-2HGA) accumulate the L-enantiomer of 2HG ( Box 1) as a result of rare germ-line mutations in the L2GDH gene that encodes L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. Some of these L-2HGA patients develop malignant brain tumors 58 ;  59. Although brain cancer in D-2HG aciduria patients has not been reported, D-2HG aciduria leads to a more severe clinical course than L-2HGA and based on the timing of glioma formation in L-2HGA patients, D-2HG aciduria patients succumb before gliomas can form [60]. Although the link to cancer is tantalizing, direct evidence for how 2HG production (both L- and D-enantiomers [61]) leads to cancer is still lacking.  However, several hypotheses of how 2HG can drive tumor development are readily testable. Structural similarities between 2HG and α-KG lead to the hypothesis that high levels of 2HG could competitively inhibit several α-KG-dependent enzymes important in cancer (Figure 3). Perhaps the best examples of these enzymes are the dioxygenases that use α-KG as a substrate to catalyze a wide range of reactions, including the biosynthesis of collagen or L-carnitine, the repair of alkylated DNA, sensing of oxygen and response to hypoxia [62]. The prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) is one class of such dioxygenases. PHDs can destabilize hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) protein levels via the hydroxylation of a proline residue followed by Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-mediated proteasome degradation [63]. Consistent with this possibility, HIF1α is upregulated in gliomas harboring IDH mutations and PHD activity is inhibited in IDH1-mutated cell lines [51]. HIF1α activates the transcription of genes that are involved in angiogenesis, cell survival, glucose metabolism and invasion, all of which associate with increased patient mortality in several cancer types [64]. In addition, another member of the PHD family, p53-induced α(II) collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase, which generates antiangiogenic collagen fragments, could be modulated allosterically by 2HG in mutated IDH cells [65]. By these two mechanisms, 2HG has the potential to promote tumor angiogenesis through the competitive inhibition of PHD enzymes.  The methylation of DNA and histones is an important mechanism regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation. Methylation is established and maintained by the balanced activities of methyltransferases and demethylases and α-KG is a substrate for certain classes of these enzymes, including Jumonji 2 (JMJD2) and Jmj C domain-containing histone demethylase-1 (JHDM1) histone demethylases [66]. Thus, mutant IDH could affect global or local methylation patterns, altering the expression of oncogenes, tumor suppressors or other key signaling and metabolic pathway components via the competitive inhibition of histone demethylases by 2HG. Of note, IDH1 mutational status strongly associates with the promoter methylation of the DNA repair gene O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) [67]. The methylation of the MGMT promoter silences MGMT expression and associates with a favorable prognosis in adult glioblastoma patients treated with TMZ.  In addition, α-KG-dependent metabolic enzymes could also be inhibited by 2HG, such as JLP1, an iron sulfonate α-KG-dependent dioxygenase involved in sulfonate catabolism for sulfur utilization [68]. Mutant IDH could, therefore, affect cellular adaptation to environmental and nutritional stress. In addition, structural similarities between D-2HG and glutamate suggest that 2HG could affect excitotoxicity via the activation of the glutamate receptor (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid – NMDA – receptor) in neurons. In fact, in rat brains in vivo treatment with 2HG activates the NMDA receptor, disturbs intracellular calcium homeostasis and elicits the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 69 ;  70, although the mechanism by which the excitotoxic activation of neurons might contribute to AML pathogenesis is unclear. Thus, mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 that result in both the loss of function in oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate and the gain of function in reductive catalysis of α-KG to 2HG could stabilize HIF1α, change DNA and histone methylation patterns and lead to ROS accumulation to drive the pathogenesis of gliomas and AML.  Lastly, the current understanding of cancer metabolism bears the concept that cancer cells adapt to metabolize nutrients into the biomass (e.g. nucleotides, amino acids and lipids) rather than for energy production [2]. Because IDH is an important NADPH-producing enzyme, the inactivation of the forward reaction or the gain of function in the reverse direction by the somatic mutation could alter the cellular NADPH/NADP+ ratio, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, NADPH prevents oxidative stress via the production of glutathione, without which free radicals are formed that can damage DNA and lead to cancer formation [71]. Other metabolic nodes regulated by the NADPH/NADP+ ratio such as the pentose phosphate cycle could also be affected, leading to metabolic alteration and ultimately cellular stress [72].  In summary, analyses of prevalence in two distinct cancer types and their commonality with respect to the IDH mutation provide valuable clues to the role this potential oncogene plays in the development of AML and GBM. There are several testable hypotheses based on elevated 2HG through which researchers can begin to elucidate the oncogenic mechanism of mutated IDH in cancer.  Therapeutic opportunity The surprising finding that a somatic point mutation could alter IDH so it produces the metabolite 2HG and that IDH mutations and elevated 2HG are found in at least two major distinct cancers types provides researchers with an extraordinary opportunity to uncover new fundamental mechanisms in cancer. More work is needed to elucidate the precise role 2HG plays in cancer initiation and progression. But the discovery of this novel gain-of-function mutation in GBM, AML and other cancer types provides an opportunity for therapeutic development. The convergence of various IDH1 and IDH2 mutants to produce the common 2HG dictates that a therapeutic goal should be the blocking of tumor-associated 2HG via inhibiting mutant IDH enzymes.  With respect to small-molecule development, to date there have been only a few reports of inhibitors designed against dehydrogenases, and only inositol monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitors have advanced into clinical development 73 ;  74. Other preclinical examples include gossypol, a polyphenolic aldehyde that inhibits dehydrogenases [75]. Despite its low potency and poor properties, this chemical scaffold could provide a starting point for medicinal chemistry design or at least serve as an inhibitor-binding model for the de novo synthesis of other more drug-like chemical scaffolds. Indeed, derivatives such as substituted 2,3-dihydroxy-1-naphthoic acids bind the dinucleotide pocket of LDHA with good potency [76].  One common concern when designing inhibitors against an enzyme's active site, especially NADPH-competitive inhibitors, is the potential for the unintended inhibition of other NADPH-utilizing enzymes. In particular, the nonspecific inhibition of wild-type IDH1 and especially IDH2 in normal tissues such as the heart or liver could significantly narrow the therapeutic index potential. However, inhibitors that span both cofactor and substrate site, for example biligand inhibitors, exhibit good selectivity among oxidoreductases [77], suggesting that highly specific inhibitors against mutated IDH in theory are achievable. Clinical development strategy ultimately will define which isoform(s) to target based on disease prevalence, but it seems that the two principal isoforms to target are IDH1 R132H and IDH2 R140Q for GBM and AML, respectively. Inhibitor design could target the NADPH-binding cleft, which is structurally identical among the IDH mutants to potentially develop a panspecific inhibitor for treating multiple indications. For clinical development in GBM specifically, compound selection criteria should include consideration for good blood–brain barrier penetration. Regardless of clinical development strategy, one significant outcome of all the work cited in this review is the opportunity to utilize 2HG by direct LC-MS measurement or by noninvasive imaging technique [78] as a guiding pharmacodynamic biomarker or as a diagnostic marker for responder-patient stratification for the development of IDH-targeted therapy.  In conclusion, the prospect that IDH mutation and elevated 2HG define new molecular subtypes of GBM and AML is an exciting one for clinical and basic researchers alike. Collective evidence suggests that IDH mutants act as driver oncogenes in the development of these cancers. Such compelling biological rationale and the good understanding of IDH mutant biochemistry together provide an opportunity for the discovery and development of therapeutics against cancer with an IDH mutation. Monoallelic point mutations in cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and its mitochondrial homolog IDH2 can lead to elevated levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in multiple cancers. Here we report that cellular 2HG production from cytosolic IDH1 mutation is dependent on the activity of a retained wild-type IDH1 allele. In contrast, expression of mitochondrial IDH2 mutations led to robust 2HG production in a manner independent of wild-type mitochondrial IDH function. Among the recurrent IDH2 mutations at Arg-172 and Arg-140, IDH2 Arg-172 mutations consistently led to greater 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-140 mutations, and the degree of 2HG accumulation correlated with the ability of these mutations to block cellular differentiation. Cytosolic IDH1 Arg-132 mutations, although structurally analogous to mutations at mitochondrial IDH2 Arg-172, were only able to elevate intracellular 2HG to comparable levels when an equivalent level of wild-type IDH1 was co-expressed. Consistent with 2HG production from cytosolic IDH1 being limited by substrate production from wild-type IDH1, we observed 2HG levels to increase in cancer cells harboring an endogenous monoallelic IDH1 mutation when mitochondrial IDH flux was diverted to the cytosol. Finally, expression of an IDH1 construct engineered to localize to the mitochondria rather than the cytosol resulted in greater 2HG accumulation. These data demonstrate that allelic and subcellular compartment differences can regulate the potential for IDH mutations to produce 2HG in cells. The consequences of 2HG elevation are dose-dependent, and the non-equivalent 2HG accumulation resulting from IDH1 and IDH2 mutations may underlie their differential prognosis and prevalence in various cancers.  Keywords: Cancer Biology, Cell Metabolism, Leukemia, Mitochondria, Tumor Metabolism Go to: Introduction Monoallelic point mutations in cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)3 were first discovered in exon sequencing studies of glioma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (1–3). All of the reported mutations were missense and at a single residue in the active site, Arg-132. These mutations were initially hypothesized to promote tumorigenesis through loss-of-function for the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate, coupled with dominant-negative activity against the retained wild-type allele (4). However, subsequent work found a novel gain-of-function for Arg-132 mutations in IDH1, as well as for structurally analogous mutations at Arg-172 of IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. This shared neomorphic enzymatic activity is the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(−)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) (5–7). Metabolite screening of AML samples revealed that 2HG-producing mutations can also occur at the non-orthologous Arg-140 residue of mitochondrial IDH2 (7). Collectively, 2HG-producing IDH1 Arg-132, IDH2 Arg-172, and IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are now known to be present in a large fraction of glioma, AML, chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarinoma, and T-cell angioimmunoblastic lymphoma samples, as well as isolated cases of colorectal and prostate cancer (3, 8–13). Additional 2HG-producing IDH mutations beyond those at IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172/Arg-140 exist, but appear to be very rare and do not include rare IDH mutations reported in thyroid cancer and melanoma nor common IDH single nucleotide polymorphisms (14).  Through production of the oncometabolite 2HG, IDH mutations have been proposed to have numerous pro-tumorigenic effects, most notably the competitive inhibition of α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzymes that modify chromatin (15–19). These effects have been associated with a block in cell differentiation. Although Arg-132 mutations in cytosolic IDH1, the analogous Arg-172 mutations in mitochondrial IDH2, and the non-analogous IDH2 Arg-140 mutations all demonstrate the ability to elevate 2HG oncometabolite levels, it is becoming increasingly clear that these mutations are not functionally equivalent. The best evidence to date for this concept may be found in AML, where a better prognosis for patients with IDH2 Arg-140 mutations versus those with IDH2 Arg-172 mutations or IDH1 Arg-132 mutations has been reported by multiple groups (20–22). IDH2 Arg-140 mutations have yet to be described in glioma, chondrosarcoma, or cholangiocarinoma, despite the established prevalence of both IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172 mutations in these cancers. In contrast, IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are the only IDH mutations found in the inborn error of metabolism d-2HG aciduria (23). The importance of subcellular localization differences between IDH1 and IDH2 proteins has also remained unexplored.  In this study, we have determined that there are distinct differences between the various 2HG-producing IDH1 and IDH2 mutations; both upstream regarding the metabolic pathways required to support 2HG production, and downstream regarding the cellular consequences of 2HG accumulation. The extent of 2HG production from mitochondrial IDH2 mutations depends on the particular site that is mutated. IDH2 Arg-140 mutations result in less cellular 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations under a variety of experimental conditions, correlating with the weaker ability of Arg-140 mutations to impair cell differentiation relative to Arg-172 mutations. Surprisingly, mutations in cytosolic IDH1 Arg-132, structurally analogous to mutations in mitochondrial IDH2 Arg-172, do not produce as much 2HG when overexpressed in cells at comparable levels. To a much greater extent than mitochondrial IDH2 mutations, cytosolic IDH1 mutations are substrate-limited for 2HG production in cells. Cellular 2HG accumulation from mutant IDH1 can be enhanced by co-expression of wild-type IDH1, diversion of wild-type IDH flux from mitochondria to cytosol, or forced re-localization of mutant IDH1 from cytosol to mitochondria. These results identify dose-dependent consequences of cellular 2HG accumulation and demonstrate that both allelic differences and the subcellular compartmentalization of metabolic flux can affect the ability of IDH mutations to result in cellular 2HG accumulation.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture and Reagents 293T cells, 3T3-L1 cells, JJ012 chondrosarcoma cells (24), and CS-1 chondrosarcoma cells (25) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (CellGro). JJ012 cells have a monoallelic endogenous IDH1 R132G mutation that has previously been reported (26), which we confirmed by Sequenom assay. CS-1 cells have a monoallelic endogenous IDH2 R172S mutation, which we determined by Sequenom assay. IDH mutation analysis in this cell line has not been previously reported. 3T3-L1 cells with stable expression of wild-type or mutant IDH2 were generated as described previously (17).  Cell Differentiation, Oil Red O Staining, Quantitative Real-time PCR 3T3-L1 cell differentiation, Oil Red O staining, and quantitative real-time PCR were performed as previously described (17). Experiments on primary murine bone marrow were performed according to previously published methods (16).  Protein Harvest and Quantitation and Western Blot Cells were lysed 48 h following transfection with RIPA buffer or mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 2 and 3 (Sigma). Lysates were sonicated with 2 × 30-s pulses using the high setting on a Bioruptor300 (Diagenode) and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were subsequently collected and assessed for protein concentration with BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). α-Ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption assays from cell lysates were performed as previously described (7). For cellular fractionation experiments, cells were lysed in isotonic buffer containing 200 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were homogenized with 60 strikes in a Dounce homogenizer and then centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. This supernatant was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet from this centrifugation was resuspended in RIPA buffer + protease inhibitor mixture and used as the heavy membrane fraction, whereas the supernatant layer was collected as the non-heavy membrane fraction. For Western blotting, lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE on Novex 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. Primary antibodies used were: anti-IDH1 (Santa Cruz sc-49996, 1:200 dilution), anti-IDH2 (Abcam ab55271, 1:500), anti-IDH3A (Abcam ab58641, 1:750), anti-ACO2 (Cell Signaling 6922, 1:1,000), anti-FLAG (Sigma F1804, 1:250), anti-Myc tag (Millipore 05–419, 1:1,000), anti-VDAC (Cell Signaling 4661S, 1:2,000), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma T6199, 1:10,000), and anti-S6 (Cell Signaling 2317 or 2217, 1:1,000). Detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat antibodies (GE Healthcare NA934V, GE Healthcare NA931V, and Santa Cruz sc-2020; all 1:10,000 dilution).  Metabolite Extraction Following gentle removal of culture medium from proliferating cells, cells were rapidly quenched with 80% methanol pre-chilled to −80 °C and containing a M+5 internal standard of R(−)-2HG containing five deuterium atoms (d-2-hydroxyglutaric-2,3,3,4,4-d5 acid; details for synthesis can be found in supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). Following incubation at −80 °C for at least 30 min, cell extracts were collected, sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated protein. Supernatants were next dried under nitrogen gas, redissolved in 1:1 acetonitrile: N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (Regis, Morton Grove, IL), and heated at 70 °C for 80 min to derivatize metabolites. t-Butyl dimethyl silyl derivatives of organic acids were then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as previously described (7, 27). 2HG levels were obtained by quantifying the peak area of the ion at m/z 433, formed through the loss of a t-butyl group (−57 atomic mass units) from the molecular ion tri-t-butyl dimethyl silyl-2HG, and normalizing to the peak area of the m/z 438 ion (representing the analogous derivative of the d5-2HG internal standard spiked at known concentration) and the total cellular protein as measured by BCA.  Plasmid Construction and Transfection The cDNA clone of human IDH1 (BC012846.1) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection, and human IDH2 (BC009244) from Invitrogen. IDH1 R132H, IDH2 R172K, and IDH2 R140Q point mutations were generated as previously described (17). FLAG or Myc tags were added to the C termini of the open reading frames by standard PCR techniques. To introduce siRNA resistance, silent point mutations were generated as follows by site-directed mutagenesis: for IDH1, the cDNA sequence 5′-gt cac tac cgc atg tac ca-3′ was changed to 5′-gt cat tat agg atg tat ca-3′ (alterations underlined) to confer resistance to the human IDH1 siRNA with sense sequence 5′-gu cac uac cgc aug uac ca-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs01_00340497). For IDH2, the cDNA sequence 5′-gt gat gag atg acc cgt at-3′ was changed to 5′-gc gac gaa aca agg at-3′ to confer resistance to the human IDH2 siRNA with sense sequence 5′-gu gau gag aug acc cgu au-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs01_00151612). These changes are not predicted to alter the sequence of the translated IDH1/2 proteins. To generate the IDH1 construct that localizes to mitochondria, the cDNA sequence encoding the predicted N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of IDH2 plus 10 subsequent amino acids was amplified using primers 5′-tgt caa ggt tta ttg aag tca aaa tgg ccg gct acc tgc ggg t-3′ and 5′-tct cct tgc atc tct acc acg ggc ttc gcc acc ttg atc c-3′. The resulting PCR product was purified and subsequently used as a “super primer” in a standard QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis reaction (28) using the IDH1 cDNA as template (with the underlined segments of the above listed primers providing the necessary complementarity to the IDH1 cDNA for the super primer). The mutagenesis reaction was then transformed into TOP10 cells (Invitrogen) and clones were identified that had incorporated the desired N-terminal MTS and subsequent 10 residues of IDH2 in place of the first 9 residues of IDH1. A similar N-terminal IDH domain swapping strategy has previously been shown to be effective with yeast IDH enzymes (29). Integrity of constructs was confirmed by direct sequencing prior to transfection into 293T cells in pCMV-Sport6 or pCDNA3 expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions.  siRNA For siRNA experiments in JJ012 and CS-1 cells, cells were reverse transfected with Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen) using 30 pmol of siRNA (final concentration of 10 nm) per 1.5 × 105 cells/well of 6-well plates. For plasmid and siRNA co-transfection experiments in 293T cells, forward transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 using 50–60 pmol of siRNA (final concentration of 25–30 nm) per 7–8 × 105 cells/well of 6-well plates. In addition to the IDH1 and IDH2 siRNAs described above, additional siRNAs used were: universal negative control from Sigma-Proligo (SIC001), IDH1 5′-cugucuaaggguuggccuu-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs01_00023490), IDH2 5′-caagucuucggguggcuuu-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs02_00333382), IDH3A 5′-caggcaaggacauggcgaa-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs02_00339757), ACO2 5′-cauccauuaugaccugcu-3′ and 5′-cauuaacauuguucgcaa-3′ from Ambion (Silencer Select 4390824, s921 and s922). All listed sequences are for the sense strand.  Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed with Student's t test. To analyze experiments comparing 2HG accumulation in pairs of transfectants over a range of IDH expression levels, a paired samples Student's t test was used.  Go to: RESULTS Extent of 2HG Production from Mitochondrial IDH2 Mutations Depends on the Affected Residue but Not on Wild-type IDH Activity Arg-172 mutations in mitochondrial IDH2 are found in glioma, chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and lymphoma, and are associated with a poor prognosis in AML. In contrast, Arg-140 mutations are not found in glioma, chondrosarcoma, and cholangiocarcinoma, and are associated with a better prognosis in AML. We hypothesized that these differences could be accounted for, in part, by quantitative differences in the extent of cellular 2HG accumulation resulting from Arg-140 versus Arg-172 mutations. To test this hypothesis, we compared the most common IDH2 mutations R140Q and R172K for their ability to produce 2HG at various levels of expression in cells lacking endogenous IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. Increasing expression of both mutants led to increasing amounts of 2HG (Fig. 1A). However, R172K mutant IDH2 expression consistently resulted in more 2HG accumulation than R140Q mutant expression (p < 0.005).  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Mitochondrial IDH2 Arg-140 mutations result in less cellular 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations, and 2HG accumulation from both mutations is insensitive to depletion of wild-type IDH. A, FLAG-tagged IDH2 R140Q and R172K cDNA constructs, or empty ... In most reported cases, both Arg-140 and Arg-172 mutations in IDH2 occur at only one allele, with retention of one wild-type IDH2 copy in tumors. Wild-type IDH2 can potentially produce both mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate and NADPH, the substrates for the neomorphic activity of mutant IDH2. To address whether differential dependence on wild-type IDH2 function could account for the differences in 2HG production we observed between Arg-140 and Arg-172 mutations, we expressed siRNA-resistant versions of the IDH2 R140Q and R172K mutants with or without simultaneous siRNA knockdown of the endogenous wild-type IDH2. The ability of both mutations to result in 2HG accumulation was insensitive to knockdown of the endogenous wild-type IDH2 (Fig. 1B). To address whether IDH3, which produces mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate and NADH, could compensate for the loss of wild-type IDH2, we expressed siRNA-resistant versions of IDH2 R140Q or R172K with simultaneous knockdown of either IDH3 alone or IDH3 together with endogenous wild-type IDH2 (Fig. 1C). Neither IDH3 knockdown alone nor the combined knockdown of endogenous wild-type IDH2 and IDH3 decreased cellular 2HG accumulation from IDH2 R140Q or R172K mutant expression. Directly upstream of the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate by wild-type mitochondrial IDH2 and IDH3 is the mitochondrial aconitase ACO2, which isomerizes mitochondrial citrate to isocitrate. In a chondrosarcoma cell line with a naturally occurring, endogenous, monoallelic IDH2 R172S mutation, we examined the effect of impairing the pathway of mitochondrial citrate to α-ketoglutarate conversion. As expected, siRNA against IDH2 in this cell line, targeting both the mutant and wild-type IDH2, resulted in a sharp decrease in 2HG accumulation from mutant IDH2. However, knockdown of ACO2 did not impair 2HG accumulation, providing further evidence that the ability to convert citrate to isocitrate and then α-ketoglutarate in the mitochondria is not critical for the production of 2HG by mitochondrial IDH2 mutations (Fig. 1D). siRNA knockdown of either IDH3 or IDH1 was also unable to markedly impair 2HG accumulation in these cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that IDH2 Arg-140 mutations consistently result in less 2HG accumulation in cells than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations, and that 2HG production by IDH2 mutations is unaffected by impaired production of α-ketoglutarate from mitochondrial citrate in multiple cell types.  Differential 2HG Production by IDH2 Arg-140 and Arg-172 Mutations Has Consequences for Gene Expression and Cell Differentiation Recent work has highlighted the ability of 2HG to inhibit multiple α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzymes and impair growth factor/cytokine-induced gene expression and the ability of cells to differentiate. Previously we have reported that stable expression of an R172K IDH2 mutant in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes can impair their ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes following exposure to a well established differentiation mixture and this effect can be mimicked by adding cell penetrant forms of 2HG to the medium (17). To extend this observation, 3T3-L1 cells expressing either the R140Q or R172K mutant of IDH2 were compared. Although IDH2 R140Q expressing 3T3-L1 cells were impaired in their ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes, the extent of differentiation blockade was consistently less than that observed with IDH2 R172K expressing cells (Fig. 2, A-C). IDH2 R140Q expressing cells showed a more modest block in the ability to accumulate intracellular lipid as assessed by Oil Red O staining, and also demonstrated less silencing of the expression of the fat cell differentiation genes Glut4, FABP4, Adiponectin, and PPARγ than IDH2 R172K expressing cells. These effects correlated with the R140Q expressing cells accumulating 2HG to ∼⅓ of the level found in the R172K expressing cells (Fig. 2D). These findings demonstrate that IDH2 Arg-140 mutations can result in less 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations in non-transformed cells, and suggest that dosage differences in 2HG accumulation can account for the different cellular effects of IDH2 Arg-140 versus Arg-172 mutations.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. Extent of 2HG accumulation correlates with the degree of differentiation blockade in non-transformed cells expressing IDH2 Arg-140 or Arg-172 mutations. A, Western blot of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes stably expressing additional IDH2 WT, IDH2 R172K, IDH2 R140Q, ... Although we have utilized 3T3-L1 cells as a general model system for cell differentiation, reflecting the occurrence of IDH mutations in a wide variety of cancers and in metabolic disorders, we have also specifically examined the differential effects of IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R172K in a hematopoietic cell model relevant to AML. We have previously reported that expression of IDH2 R140Q can increase the expression of the progenitor cell marker c-kit (stem cell factor receptor) in murine primary bone marrow cells (16). We report here an extension of this analysis to compare the relative abilities of IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R172K to increase c-kit expression. Following 5 days of liquid culture in myeloid growth conditions, a higher percentage of c-kit expressing cells was observed in bone marrow expressing IDH2 R172K than in bone marrow expressing IDH2 R140Q (supplemental Fig. S1). These data provide further evidence that IDH2 Arg-172 and Arg-140 mutations can result in distinct degrees of cell differentiation impairment.  2HG Production from Cytosolic IDH1 Mutation in Cells Is Dependent on Retained Wild-type IDH1 Expression With no exceptions reported to date, 2HG-producing mutations at Arg-132 of cytosolic IDH1 are monoallelic, with retention of the wild-type IDH1 allele. Arg-132 of cytosolic IDH1 is the analogous residue to Arg-172 of mitochondrial IDH2 (Fig. 3A). Both IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172 play similar roles for substrate stability in the enzyme active site. To directly compare the cellular 2HG accumulation of cytosolic IDH1 Arg-132 mutations versus mitochondrial IDH2 mutations, we expressed a FLAG-tagged version of the most common IDH1 mutation, R132H, as well as both IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R172K. Surprisingly, IDH1 R132H expression did not result in as much 2HG accumulation as expression of IDH2 R172K (Fig. 3B). The inability of IDH1 R132H expression to result in as much 2HG accumulation as IDH2 R172K expression was observed across a range in mutant IDH expression (Fig. 3C). However, when additional wild-type IDH1 was co-overexpressed, 2HG accumulation was reproducibly increased in cells expressing various levels of R132H mutant IDH1 (p < 0.05). With simultaneous transfection of exogenous wild-type and mutant IDH1, predicted to maximize the formation of wild-type:mutant IDH1 heterodimers, cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 demonstrated comparable 2HG accumulation to cells expressing IDH2 R172K, and both IDH1 R132H and IDH2 R172K cells had greater 2HG levels than cells expressing IDH2 R140Q (Fig. 3C). The ability of co-overexpression of wild-type IDH1 to enhance cellular 2HG production from the R132H mutant IDH1 was also observed with untagged constructs, as well as different combinations of FLAG and Myc-tagged versions of IDH1 (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). However, co-transfection of an IDH1 A134D mutant previously reported to be catalytically inactive (14) did not result in comparable augmentation of 2HG accumulation in IDH1 R132H-transfected cells (supplemental Fig. S2C).  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Cellular 2HG accumulation from cytosolic IDH1 mutation depends on maintained expression of wild-type IDH1. A, depiction of the open reading frames of the homologous proteins cytosolic IDH1 and mitochondrial IDH2. Recurrently mutated amino acid residues ... To examine if depletion of endogenous wild-type IDH1 could impair 2HG production from mutant IDH1, we constructed a tagged version of IDH1 R132H engineered to be siRNA resistant, and co-transfected it along with siRNA against endogenous wild-type IDH1 (siIDH1). Although we reproducibly observed ∼2-fold higher expression of Myc-tagged IDH1 R132H when endogenous wild-type IDH1 levels were decreased, 2HG accumulation did not double but instead decreased by 50% (Fig. 3D). To confirm that this reduction in 2HG accumulation was due to the depletion of wild-type IDH1 and not an off-target siRNA effect, we co-transfected FLAG-tagged IDH1 WT that was also engineered to be siRNA resistant along with the siRNA-resistant Myc-tagged IDH1 R132H. With co-expression of IDH1 WT-FLAG along with IDH1 R132H-Myc, there was a 3-fold increase in 2HG production that was not diminished by endogenous wild-type IDH1 depletion with siIDH1 transfection. Cell proliferation was confirmed to be comparable under all of these transfection conditions (supplemental Fig. S2D). These results demonstrate that retention of wild-type IDH1 expression is critical for 2HG production from mutant IDH1 in the cytosol.  Impairing Mitochondrial IDH Flux Increases 2HG Production from Mutant IDH1 in the Cytosol To examine whether increasing substrate flux through the existing wild-type IDH1 can enhance the ability of mutant IDH1 to produce 2HG in the cytosol, we examined the effect of impairing mitochondrial IDH activity in JJ012 chondrosarcoma cells harboring a naturally occurring, endogenous, monoallelic IDH1 R132G mutation. Depleting mitochondrial IDH2 or IDH3 can result in the diversion of citrate and/or isocitrate to the cytosol thus increasing substrate availability for wild-type IDH1 (Fig. 4A). As expected, transfection of siRNA targeting both wild-type and mutant IDH1 (siIDH1) impaired the ability of these cells to accumulate 2HG (Fig. 4B). However, depletion of either mitochondrial IDH2 or IDH3 increased 2HG accumulation in these cells harboring a monoallelic IDH1 mutation. Depletion of mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2) with two independent siRNAs also led to a reproducible increase in 2HG accumulation. These results provide further evidence that the ability of mutant IDH1 to produce 2HG is limited by the local supply of substrate, which can be increased by enhancing the isocitrate → α-ketoglutarate flux and cytosolic NADPH production through wild-type IDH1.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. Impairing mitochondrial IDH flux results in increased 2HG accumulation in cells with endogenous cytosolic IDH1 mutation. A, model for metabolism in a cell harboring a monoallelic IDH1 mutation. B, JJ012 chondrosarcoma cells with a naturally occurring, ... Mitochondrial Localization of Cytosolic IDH1 Mutation Results in Greater 2HG Accumulation Collectively, the above results suggest that cytosolic IDH1 mutants are more limited in their supply of substrate for 2HG production than mitochondrial IDH2 mutants. To confirm that the differing substrate supply dependence between IDH1 and IDH2 mutants in cells is due to their subcellular localization differences, we generated an IDH1 construct that incorporated the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of IDH2 (Fig. 5A). We confirmed that this “mito-IDH1” construct localized to the cellular heavy membrane fraction containing mitochondria, like mitochondrial IDH2 and unlike cytosolic IDH1 lacking the MTS (Fig. 5B). The tagged versions of IDH1 R132H and mito-IDH R132H were then transfected over a 40-fold range. We determined that cell lysates with equivalent expression levels of the mitochondrial and cytosolic localized IDH1 R132H proteins demonstrated equivalent α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption rates when α-ketoglutarate and NAPH were provided in excess in vitro following cell lysis (data not shown). However, when assessing 2HG accumulation in cells with a range of expression levels of cytosolic IDH1 R132H or mito-IDH1 R132H, mito-IDH1 R132H-expressing cells consistently demonstrated greater 2HG accumulation than cells expressing comparable levels of cytosolic IDH1 R132H (p < 0.01, Fig. 5C). We performed another experiment to assess 2HG accumulation in cells expressing IDH1 R132H in the cytosol or mitochondria relative to cells expressing IDH2 R172K with its normal mitochondrial localization sequence intact. At comparable expression levels, both IDH2 R172K and mito-IDH1 R132H expressing cells had greater 2HG accumulation than cells expressing IDH1 R132H localized to the cytosol (Fig. 5D). Collectively, these data demonstrate that localization of IDH mutants to mitochondria rather than the cytosol results in greater 2HG accumulation in cells.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Mitochondrial localization of cytosolic IDH1 mutant results in greater accumulation of 2HG in cells. A, An IDH1 construct designed to mislocalize to the mitochondria was engineered by placing the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of IDH2 at the N ... Go to: DISCUSSION The common feature of recurrent cancer-associated mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes is a neomorphic enzymatic activity converting α-ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite 2HG. In many functional studies to date, the various 2HG-producing IDH1/2 mutations have been considered equivalent. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that distinct neomorphic IDH1/2 alleles are not found with equal frequencies across different cancers and are not associated with the same prognosis (supplemental Table S1). For example, IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are rarely found in cancer outside of myeloid malignancies. But within myeloid malignancies, IDH2 Arg-140 is the most commonly mutated IDH residue in AML, and is uniquely associated with a better AML prognosis relative to IDH2 Arg-172 and IDH1 Arg-132 mutations (20–22). Moreover, little work has addressed the importance of differential subcellular localization of the IDH1 and IDH2 proteins.  The data presented here demonstrate that the particular residue that is mutated within the IDH active site has consequences for both the amount of 2HG that accumulates and the cellular consequences of IDH mutation. Both Arg-140 and Arg-172 mutations in mitochondrial IDH2 can produce increasing amounts of 2HG at increasing cellular expression levels, and both are insensitive to impairment of wild-type IDH activity. However, across multiple expression conditions and cell types, IDH2 Arg-140 mutations consistently result in less 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations. A recent report documenting similar differences when these mutations were knocked-in to an endogenous IDH2 allele in colon cancer cells via homologous recombination provides further support for this finding (30). Here, we demonstrate that the quantitative difference in 2HG accumulation between IDH2 Arg-140 and Arg-172 mutations is within a range that can variably alter gene expression in non-transformed cells and the ability of these lineage-specific progenitor cells to differentiate into terminally differentiated cells. In addition to cancer, these data are relevant to the inborn error of metabolism d-2HG aciduria. In this disease marked by widespread 2HG elevation in cells and body fluids, nearly 50% of cases harbor IDH2 Arg-140 mutations, but other IDH mutations are not found. We propose that only the lower 2HG levels resulting from IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are compatible with embryogenesis and that higher 2HG levels resulting from other germline IDH mutations may be lethal in utero.  It remains possible that the major downstream effects of 2HG that are critical to transformation vary between different cancers. 2HG can inhibit the catalytic activity of TET2, a DNA 5-methylcytosine hydroxylase. In AML, the mutual exclusivity of IDH mutations with TET2 mutations (16), as well as the emerging phenotypes of TET2 knock-out mice (31–33), provides evidence that inhibition of TET2 function can be a critical event sufficient to promote hematologic malignancy. In contrast, other cancers like glioma harbor IDH mutations but not TET2 mutations. We have proposed that in glioma, concerted inhibition of Jumonji histone demethylases by 2HG may assume an important tumorigenic role that cannot be recapitulated by simply inhibiting TET2 (17). 2HG can also inhibit prolyl hydroxylases that modify collagen (19, 34), which are likely to be of more importance in solid tumors such as glioma and chondrosarcoma than in liquid tumors like AML. Sustained inhibition of histone demethylases and/or collagen modifying enzymes may require higher levels of 2HG than that required for effective inhibition of TET2 function in myeloid cells. This requirement may account for why the lower 2HG-producing IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are not found in solid tumors. Further studies, including those with genetically engineered mice expressing the various IDH mutations in different cell lineages, will be required to test this hypothesis.  Left unexplored in the literature to date is examination of the impact that differential subcellular localization of IDH1 and IDH2 mutant proteins has on the ability of these mutants to result in 2HG accumulation in cells. IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172 are structurally analogous residues and play similar roles in substrate binding in the enzyme active site, yet expression of IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172 mutations in cells at comparable levels did not result in equivalent levels of 2HG accumulation unless wild-type IDH1 was co-expressed. This result is unlikely to be due solely to intrinsically weaker enzymatic activity of IDH1 R132H relative to IDH2 R172K for producing 2HG, because mitochondrial targeting of IDH1 R132H also resulted in increased 2HG accumulation relative to IDH1 R132H in the cytosol. The results presented here suggest that unlike the case with mitochondrial IDH2 mutations, 2HG production from cytosolic IDH1 mutations is particularly dependent on metabolic flux through a wild-type IDH1 partner to increase the local availability of substrate.  Although both mitochondrial IDH2 and cytosolic IDH1 mutations predominantly occur in monoallelic fashion, cases with reduction to homozygosity of mutant IDH2 have been reported (26, 35), whereas loss of the wild-type IDH1 allele in an IDH1 mutant cancer has not been described to date. We have previously proposed that more efficient generation of 2HG with co-expression of WT and mutant IDH1 may exist (5). One possible explanation for this, that the WT:R132H heterodimer could have intrinsically better activity to directly reduce α-ketoglutarate to 2HG, is not supported by the recent data of Leonardi et al. (36) who shows that the recombinant WT:R132H heterodimer is not as efficient as the R132H:R132H homodimer at converting α-ketoglutarate to 2HG in vitro. Although Pietrak et al. (37) concluded that the potential for substrate channeling from isocitrate → α-ketoglutarate → 2HG through WT:R132H heterodimers is present, they also concluded that the WT subunit was not necessary for the production of 2HG by the mutant recombinant protein. This finding was arrived at when α-ketoglutarate and NADPH were supplied in excess in vitro. But particularly in light of other reports suggesting that 2HG in cells is directly produced from the pathway of glutamine → glutamate → α-ketoglutarate → 2HG (5, 38), it has remained unclear how retained expression of wild-type IDH1 could be important for 2HG production by mutant IDH1.  In contrast to these biochemical studies of purified proteins, the present data suggest that in intact cells, cytosolic mutant IDH1 is substrate limited and that wild-type IDH1 contributes to the local substrate production required for mutant IDH1 to produce 2HG. This finding adds to the growing evidence that IDH1 mutations do not act via dominant inhibition of wild-type IDH1. By contrast, our findings suggest that targeting the provision of substrate by wild-type IDH1 to mutant IDH1 may provide an additional mechanism to mitigate the ultimate effects of IDH mutations by reducing the ability to produce 2HG. This would be especially attractive if increased flux through wild-type IDH1 can be shown to be dependent on the activation of growth factor signaling pathways. Prior evidence has linked IDH1 expression levels to the activity of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein transcription factor (39). Increasing IDH1 expression has been suggested to alter cellular and organismal physiology by increasing the production of cytosolic NADPH (40). Further studies in non-transformed cell lines will be needed to test the dependence of 2HG production from cytosolic mutant IDH1 on the prior induction of growth factor signaling and increased wild-type IDH1 activity. But this hypothesis may partially explain the failure (to date) of genetically engineered mouse models to demonstrate the initiation of tumorigenesis by IDH1 mutation in a stem/progenitor cell (34, 41, 42). It appears from the present data that 2HG production from cytosolic mutant IDH1 is a dynamic process that is acutely sensitive to the background metabolic state of the cell.  In contrast to 2HG production from mutant IDH1 being dependent on wild-type IDH1, these data show that 2HG production from mutant IDH2 is not dependent on wild-type mitochondrial IDH2 (or IDH3) activity. This is consistent with the report that IDH2 mutants do not heterodimerize with IDH2 WT, unlike IDH1 R132H mutants that do heterodimerize with a wild-type partner (43). It remains a technical challenge in the field to reliably measure metabolite levels in the subcellular compartments of intact cells. Our study does not determine the percentages of α-ketoglutarate and NADPH within each subcellular compartment that are dependent on wild-type IDH activity and/or the metabolism of anaplerotic substrates like glutamine. However, the lack of dependence of 2HG production from mitochondrial IDH2 mutations on wild-type IDH activity is consistent with mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate levels being maintained by a variety of anaplerotic substrates, and with a high NADPH/NADP+ ratio being maintained in the mitochondria through the interconversion of NADH to NADPH by the mitochondrial trans-hydrogenase (44). Recent work from multiple groups has implicated wild-type IDH “reverse flux,” the NADPH-dependent reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate back to isocitrate, as playing an important role for cell growth and viability, particularly in hypoxic conditions or in cells with impaired TCA cycle function (27, 45–47). Although there is debate regarding whether this reductive carboxylation is primarily dependent upon cytosolic IDH1 or mitochondrial IDH2, the metabolic conditions that favor 2HG production from IDH mutations are also likely to favor reductive carboxylation flux from wild-type IDH proteins. The present results suggest that relative to the cytosol, mitochondria provide a more consistently favorable environment for the reductive metabolism of glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate.  The somatic mutations in cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) observed in gliomas can lead to the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Here, we report that tumor 2HG is elevated in a high percentage of patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Surprisingly, less than half of cases with elevated 2HG possessed IDH1 mutations. The remaining cases with elevated 2HG had mutations in IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. These data demonstrate that a shared feature of all cancer-associated IDH mutations is production of the onco-metabolite 2HG. Furthermore, AML patients with IDH mutations display a significantly reduced number of other well characterized AML-associated mutations and/or associated chromosomal abnormalities, potentially implicating IDH mutation in a distinct mechanism of AML pathogenesis.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Mutations in human cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase I (IDH1) occur somatically in >70% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas, and in 8.5% of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) (Mardis et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Mutations have also been reported in cancers of the colon and prostate (Kang et al., 2009; Sjoblom et al., 2006). To date, all reported IDH1 mutations result in an amino acid substitution at a single arginine residue in the enzyme’s active site, R132. A subset of intermediate grade gliomas lacking mutations in IDH1 have been found to harbor mutations in IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. The IDH2 mutations which have been identified in gliomas occur at the analogous residue to IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172. Both IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutants lack the wild-type enzyme’s ability to convert isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (Yan et al., 2009). To date, all reported IDH1 or IDH2 mutations are heterozygous, with the cancer cells retaining one wild-type copy of the relevant IDH1 or IDH2 allele. No patient has been reported with both an IDH1 and IDH2 mutation. These data argue against the IDH mutations resulting in a simple loss of function.  Normally both cytosolic IDH1 and mitochondrial IDH2 exist as homodimers within their respective cellular compartments, and the mutant proteins retain the ability to bind to their respective wild-type partner. Therefore, it has been proposed that mutant IDH1 can act as a dominant negative against wild-type IDH1 function, resulting in a decrease in cytosolic α-ketoglutarate levels and leading to an indirect activation of the HIF-1α pathway (Zhao et al., 2009). However, recent work has provided an alternative explanation. The R132H IDH1 mutation observed in gliomas was found to display a gain of function for the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) (Dang et al., 2009). This in vitro activity was confirmed when 2HG was found to be elevated in IDH1-mutated gliomas. Whether this neomorphic activity is a common feature shared by IDH2 mutations was not determined.  IDH1 R132 mutations identical to those reported to produce 2HG in gliomas were recently reported in AML (Mardis et al., 2009). These IDH1 R132 mutations were observed in 8.5% of AML patients studied, and a significantly higher percentage of mutation was observed in the subset of patients whose tumors lacked cytogenetic abnormalities. IDH2 R172 mutations were not observed in this study. However, during efforts to confirm and extend these findings, we found an IDH2 R172K mutation in an AML sample obtained from a 77 year old female. This finding confirmed that both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations can occur in AML and prompted us to more comprehensively investigate the role of IDH2 in AML.  The present study was undertaken to see if IDH2 mutations might share the same neomorphic activity as recently reported for glioma-associated IDH1 R132 mutations. We also determined whether tumor-associated 2HG elevation could prospectively identify AML patients with mutations in IDH. To investigate the lack of reduction to homozygosity for either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations in tumor samples, the ability of wild-type IDH1 and/or IDH2 to contribute to cell proliferation was examined.  Go to: RESULTS IDH2 is mutated in AML  A recent study employing a whole-genome sequencing strategy in an AML patient resulted in the identification of somatic IDH1 mutations in AML (Mardis et al., 2009). Based on the report that IDH2 mutations were also observed in the other major tumor type in which IDH1 mutations were implicated (Yan et al., 2009), we sequenced the IDH2 gene in a set of de-identified AML DNA samples. Several cases with IDH2 R172 mutations were identified. In the initial case, the IDH2 mutation found, R172K, was the same mutation reported in glioma samples. It has been recently reported that cancer-associated IDH1 R132 mutants display a loss-of-function for the use of isocitrate as substrate, with a concomitant gain-of-function for the reduction of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). This prompted us to determine if the recurrent R172K mutation in IDH2 observed in both gliomas and leukemias might also display the same neomorphic activity. In IDH1, the role of R132 in determining IDH1 enzymatic activity is consistent with the stabilizing charge interaction of its guanidinium moiety with the β-carboxyl group of isocitrate (Figure 1A). This β-carboxyl is critical for IDH’s ability to catalyze the interconversion of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate, with the overall reaction occurring in two steps through a β-carboxyl-containing intermediate (Ehrlich and Colman, 1976). Proceeding in the oxidative direction, this β-carboxyl remains on the substrate throughout the IDH reaction until the final decarboxylating step which produces α-ketoglutarate.  Figure 1 Figure 1 IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 are analogous residues that both interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 are analogous residues that both interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate  To understand how R172 mutations in IDH2 might relate to the R132 mutations in IDH1 characterized for gliomas, we modeled human IDH2 based on the pig IDH2 structure containing bound isocitrate (Ceccarelli et al., 2002). Human and pig IDH2 protein share over 97% identity and all active site residues are identical. The active site of human IDH2 was structurally aligned with human IDH1 (Figure 1). Similar to IDH1, in the active site of IDH2 the isocitrate substrate is stabilized by multiple charge interactions throughout the binding pocket. Moreover, like R132 in IDH1, the analogous R172 in IDH2 is predicted to interact strongly with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate. This raised the possibility that cancer-associated IDH2 mutations at R172 might affect enzymatic interconversion of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate similarly to IDH1 mutations at R132.  Mutation of IDH2 R172K enhances α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption  To test whether cancer-associated IDH2 R172K mutations shared the gain of function in α-ketoglutarate reduction observed for IDH1 R132 mutations (Dang et al., 2009), we overexpressed wild-type or R172K mutant IDH2 in cells with endogenous wild-type IDH2 expression, and then assessed isocitrate-dependent NADPH production and α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates. As reported previously (Yan et al., 2009), extracts from cells expressing the R172K mutant IDH2 did not display isocitrate-dependent NADPH production above the levels observed in extracts from vector-transfected cells. In contrast, extracts from cells expressing a comparable amount of wild-type IDH2 markedly increased isocitrate-dependent NADPH production (Figure 2A). However, when these same extracts were tested for NADPH consumption in the presence of α-ketoglutarate, R172K mutant IDH2 expression was found to correlate with a significant enhancement to α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption. Vector-transfected cell lysates did not demonstrate this activity (Figure 2B). Although not nearly to the same degree as with the mutant enzyme, wild-type IDH2 overexpression also reproducibly enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption under these conditions.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Expression of R172K mutant IDH2 results in enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent consumption of NADPH Mutation of IDH2 R172K results in elevated 2HG levels  R172K mutant IDH2 lacks the guanidinium moiety in residue 172 that normally stabilizes β-carboxyl addition in the interconversion of α-ketoglutarate and isocitrate. Yet R172K mutant IDH2 exhibited enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates (Figure 2B). A similar enhancement of α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption has been reported for R132 mutations in IDH1, resulting in conversion of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). To determine if cells expressing IDH2 R172K shared this property, we expressed IDH2 wild-type or IDH2 R172K in cells. The accumulation of organic acids, including 2HG, both within cells and in culture medium of the transfectants was then assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after MTBSTFA derivatization of the organic acid pool. We observed a metabolite peak eluting at 32.5 min on GC-MS which was of minimal intensity in the culture medium of IDH2 wild-type expressing cells, but which in the medium of IDH2 R172K expressing cells had a markedly higher intensity approximating that of the glutamate signal (Figures 3A–3B). Mass spectra of this metabolite peak fit that predicted for MTBSTFA-derivatized 2HG, and the peak’s identity as 2HG was additionally confirmed by matching its mass spectra with that obtained by derivatization of commercial 2HG standards (Figure 3C). Similar results were obtained when the intracellular organic acid pool was analyzed. IDH2 R172K expressing cells were found to have an approximately 100-fold increase in the intracellular levels of 2HG compared with the levels detected in vector-transfected and IDH2 wild-type overexpressing cells (Figure 3D). Consistent with previous work, IDH1 R132H expressing cells analyzed in the same experiment had comparable accumulation of 2HG in both cells and in culture medium. 2HG accumulation was not observed in cells overexpressing IDH1 wild-type (data not shown).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Expression of R172K mutant IDH2 elevates 2HG levels within cells and in culture medium Mutant IDH2 produces the (R) enantiomer of 2HG  Cancer-associated mutants of IDH1 produce the (R) enantiomer of 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). To determine the chirality of the 2HG produced by mutant IDH2 and to compare it with that produced by R132H mutant IDH1, we used a two step derivatization method to distinguish the stereoisomers of 2HG by GC-MS: an esterification step with R-(-)-2-butanolic HCl, followed by acetylation of the 2-hydroxyl with acetic anhydride (Kamerling et al., 1981). Test of this method on commercial S(+)-2HG and R(-)-2HG standards demonstrated clear separation of the (S) and (R) enantiomers, and mass spectra of the metabolite peaks confirmed their identity as the O-acetylated di-(-)-2-butyl esters of 2HG (Figure S1A and S1B). By this method, we confirmed the chirality of the 2HG found in cells expressing either R132H mutant IDH1 or R172K mutant IDH2 corresponded exclusively to the (R) enantiomer (Figure S1C and S1D).  Leukemic cells bearing heterozygous R172K IDH2 mutations accumulate 2HG  To determine whether 2HG also accumulates in leukemic cells with either IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutations, we next analyzed the 2HG levels of selected leukemic samples. To date, every IDH1 R132H or IDH2 R172K mutant AML sample has exhibited evidence of 2HG accumulation, demonstrating a 2HG signal intensity by GC-MS analysis that is ≥ 30% of the intrasample glutamate signal. In contrast, control extracts have either had undetectable 2HG or a 2HG signal ≤ 1% of that for glutamate (n=13, p<0.001). Thus leukemic cells bearing either IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutation share the ability to accumulate 2HG in vivo with glioma cells exhibiting IDH1 R132 mutations.  IDH2 is critical for proliferating cells and contributes to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate in the mitochondria  A peculiar feature of the IDH-mutated cancers described to date is their lack of reduction to homozygosity. All tumors with IDH mutations retain one IDH wild-type allele. To address this issue we examined whether wild-type IDH1 and/or IDH2 might play a role in either cell survival or proliferation. Consistent with this possibility, we found that siRNA knockdown of either IDH1 or IDH2 can significantly reduce the proliferative capacity of a cancer cell line expressing both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 (Figure 4A).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Both IDH1 and IDH2 are critical for cell proliferation IDH1 is one of only three cytosolic enzymes that contribute to the NADPH production required for nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis during cell growth (DeBerardinis et al., 2007). In addition, IDH1 contributes to the maintenance of cytosolic redox state (Yan et al., 2009). Therefore, there are several reasons why IDH1 might be important for cell proliferation. However, unlike IDH1, IDH2 resides in the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria normally contain a high level of NADPH and readily interconvert NADH and NADPH (Rydstrom, 2006). Furthermore, it is IDH3, the NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, that is believed to be responsible for isocitrate conversion into α-ketoglutarate in the mitochondrial citric acid cycle (McCormack and Denton, 1979). This raised the possibility that wild-type IDH2 might be contributing to the ability of cancer cells to produce citrate from glutamine, as illustrated in Figure 4B. Such an enzymatic activity, though not ascribed to a particular IDH isoform, was characterized in early metabolic studies (Ochoa, 1948; Siebert et al., 1957). As shown in Figure 2B, when wild-type IDH2 was over-expressed in cells, it was found to consume NADPH in an α-ketoglutarate-dependent manner.  To test the possibility that wild-type IDH2 contributes to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate in the mitochondria of proliferating cells, we labeled cells with [13C-U]-L-glutamine (glutamine +5), and subsequently measured isotopic enrichment in citrate by GC-MS. Enrichment of citrate with five 13C atoms (citrate +5) can arise from the reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate +5 to isocitrate +5, while citrate enriched with four 13C atoms (citrate +4) can arise from oxidative metabolism of α-ketoglutarate through the traditional citric acid cycle (Figure 4B). Both forms of citrate production were reproducibly observed. To examine the role of IDH2 in citrate production, cells were treated with one of two independent IDH2 siRNAs. IDH2 siRNA treated cells displayed a significant reduction in levels of citrate +5, supporting a role for mitochondrial IDH2 in reductive carboxylation. Of note, no change in citrate +4 levels was observed, indicating that the effect of IDH2 knockdown was specific and not affecting other fundamental processes regulating the citric acid cycle (Figure 4C). Similar labeling patterns were observed in aconitate, an intermediate in the isomerization of isocitrate to citrate, with aconitate +5 also reduced following IDH2 knockdown, and aconitate +4 levels remaining unchanged (data not shown). In contrast, when cells were treated with one of two independent siRNAs against IDH3, there was a reproducible increase in citrate +5, while citrate +4 was unchanged (Figure 4D). These data support a role for IDH2 and not IDH3 in the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate by reductive carboxylation in the mitochondria, and provide a possible explanation for the lack of reduction to homozygosity for IDH2 mutations in cancer.  2HG can be used as a screening test for neomorphic IDH mutants  The above data suggest that the common feature of the IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutants is an ability to produce 2HG that can be measured directly in tumor samples. This suggested that screening for the presence of 2HG in tumor samples could be used as an assay to detect IDH mutations. To test this hypothesis, we obtained frozen samples of AML cells from 18 patients aged 50 years or older who presented with normal karyotype AML. All 18 samples were first screened for the intensity of their 2HG signal on GC-MS as a percentage of the intrasample glutamate signal (Table 1 and Figure 5). GC-MS analysis demonstrated that 9 of 18 samples had elevated 2HG. This fraction of samples was much higher than expected from the reported incidence of IDH1 mutation (Mardis et al., 2009). To correlate the results with mutation status, IDH1 and IDH2 were sequenced for all 18 samples in a blinded fashion. All samples displaying a signal ratio for 2HG/glutamate > 1% had either an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation. In contrast, none of the samples with a 2HG/glutamate signal ratio ≤ 1% had an IDH mutation (Table 1). Thus in this sample set, 2HG measurement was predictive of IDH mutation status.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Primary human AML samples with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations display marked elevations of 2HG Table 1 Table 1 Patient characteristics, metabolite analysis, and IDH status. The genetic analysis of these tumor samples revealed two neomorphic IDH mutations that produce 2HG. Among the IDH1 mutations, tumors with IDH1 R132C or IDH1 R132G accumulated 2HG. This result is not unexpected, as a number of mutations of R132 to other residues have also been shown to accumulate 2HG in glioma samples (Dang et al., 2009).  The other neomorphic allele was unexpected. All five of the IDH2 mutations producing 2HG in this sample set contained the same mutation, R140Q. As shown in Figure 1, both R140 in IDH2 and R100 in IDH1 are predicted to interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate. Additional modeling revealed that despite the reduced ability to bind isocitrate, the R140Q mutant IDH2 is predicted to maintain its ability to bind and orient α-ketoglutarate in the active site (Figure 6). This potentially explains the ability of cells with this neomorph to accumulate 2HG in vivo. As shown in Figure 5, samples containing IDH2 R140Q mutations were found to have accumulated 2HG to levels 10–100 fold greater than the highest levels detected in IDH wild-type samples.  Figure 6 Figure 6 Structural modeling of R140Q mutant IDH2 IDH2 mutations are more common than IDH1 mutations in AML  In the above sample set, just over half of the AML samples with 2HG accumulation had IDH2 mutations. This is in contrast to the data reported for gliomas in which less than 5% of IDH mutations were in IDH2 (Hartmann et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Initial studies of IDH genes in leukemia had failed to detect IDH2 mutations in R172 (Mardis et al., 2009). In the 18 cases we examined initially, all of the IDH2 mutations were IDH2 R140Q. However, this sample may have been biased by either the sample size and/or patient selection. We therefore analyzed 78 serial AML samples collected from a single center to determine the frequency of IDH1/2 mutation and investigated the co-association of IDH1/2 mutations with other genes known to contribute to AML pathogenesis (Table 2). While IDH1 mutations were found in 7.7% of samples in this analysis (6/78), twice as many mutations were detected in IDH2, at a frequency of 15.4% (12/78, p<0.05). Both the R140Q and R172K neomorphic alleles of IDH2 were identified. Of note, the IDH2 R140Q mutation was observed in more patients (7/78) than the R172K allele of IDH2 or R132 mutations in IDH1. None of the IDH2-mutated samples were found to also have somatic mutations in Flt-3, NPM1, or ASXL1. Furthermore, IDH2 and IDH1 mutations were only observed in normal karyotype AML patients, whereas known cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in 7/51 samples without IDH1/2 mutations (13.7%; all IDH mutants vs. IDH wild-type, p<0.05). We also examined whether IDH1 and/or IDH2 mutation status had any effect on the overall survival of this set of patients. As was previously reported (Mardis et al., 2009), mutations in IDH1 did not appear to affect overall survival (p=0.37, Figure S2A). However, we noted a trend towards improved survival in patients who presented with IDH2 mutations (p=0.08, Figure S2B).  Table 2 Table 2 Clinical and genetic parameters of IDH1/2 wild-type and mutant AML samples. Go to: DISCUSSION Neomorphic enzymatic activity to produce 2HG is the shared feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations  Mutations in the cytosolic enzyme IDH1 have been reported in a high percentage of gliomas and a significant subset of AML patients (Mardis et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Recently, IDH1 mutations of R132 were associated with the accumulation of the metabolite 2HG in glial tumor samples (Dang et al., 2009). The discovery of an elderly AML patient with an IDH2 R172 mutation, the analogous residue to IDH1 R132, prompted us to test whether this IDH2 mutation also resulted in a gain-of-function ability to catalyze the conversion of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG. In this study of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in AML, we have demonstrated that 2HG production is a common feature of the spontaneous mutations in these two IDH homologs. By showing that 2HG production can result from mutation at any of three residues which normally stabilize the β-carboxyl of isocitrate, IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172, and IDH2 R140, we demonstrate that it is the truncated, non-carboxylating, reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate that is the common feature linking all cancer-associated IDH mutations.  2HG as a screening and diagnostic marker  With our demonstration that 2HG production is the common feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, the measurement of 2HG levels allowed us to identify additional IDH mutations in AML patients. This is exemplified in this study by the use of 2HG screening to identify two distinct mutations in IDH2, R140Q and R172K, that produce 2HG. These data demonstrate that at least IDH2 neomorphic mutations are not limited to a single arginine residue. Therefore, additional IDH1 and IDH2 neomorphic alleles may still remain to be found in gliomas, hematopoietic malignancies, and in other cancers. The 2HG levels in cancers with IDH mutations are consistently 10–100 fold elevated over levels found in samples lacking mutations of IDH1 or IDH2. Inborn errors of metabolism which lead to 2HG elevation are exceptionally rare and have devastating developmental consequences (Kolker et al., 2002a). Tumors displaying elevated 2HG are unlikely to be false positives. Thus, 2HG appears to be an important marker of IDH1/2-mutated neoplasms. Given the quantities of 2HG that accumulate in the culture medium of cells expressing IDH mutant enzymes, 2HG may even be detectable in the peripheral blood of leukemia patients with IDH mutations at the time of presentation. We are currently testing the potential of such a screening and diagnostic approach.  Maintaining at least one IDH1 and IDH2 wild-type allele may be essential for transformed cells  2HG production is a shared feature of heterozygous mutations in either cytosolic IDH1 or mitochondrial IDH2. There is a marked difference in the enzymatic rate of isocitrate-dependent NADPH production by the wild-type proteins and α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption by both IDH1 and IDH2 mutants (Figure 2 and Dang et al., 2009). Nevertheless, both mutant proteins lead to an over 100-fold increase in tumor 2HG accumulation. In addition, it appears that both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 can play positive and non-redundant roles in cell proliferation. The roles of IDH1 and IDH2 in supporting cell proliferation are likely to be different. IDH1 contributes to cytosolic NADPH production. In the case of IDH1 mutant proteins, it has been reported that a local supply of NADPH and α-ketoglutarate is required to drive 2HG production (Dang et al., 2009). In the context of a wild-type/mutant IDH1 heterodimer, the required substrates for the mutant’s neomorphic activity are most readily provided by the wild-type subunit’s normal activity on NADP+ and isocitrate. However, for the neomorphic activity of mitochondrial IDH2 mutants, the requirement for local generation of substrate is unlikely to be absolute. Mitochondria typically have a high NADPH/NADP+ ratio, supported in part by the ability to interconvert NADPH and NADH in the matrix (Rydstrom, 2006). In addition, mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate is maintained at high levels by a variety of anaplerotic substrates. While the exact role of wild-type IDH2 in supporting cell growth will require further investigation, this requirement correlates with the ability of IDH2 to contribute to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate via a pathway of reductive carboxylation in the mitochondria of proliferating cells.  2HG as an onco-metabolite  Although 2HG has been proposed to increase ROS levels in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism (Kolker et al., 2002b; Latini et al., 2003), to date we have no evidence that the metabolite acts as a mutagen. This is consistent with data presented here that IDH1-mutated and IDH2-mutated AML samples typically do not harbor other known mutations associated with AML, as well as a prior report that IDH-mutated gliomas often lack other mutations that are commonly acquired early in glioma pathogenesis (Yan et al., 2009). In an AML case with an IDH1 mutation that was sequenced in its entirety (Mardis et al., 2009), there were a relatively small total number of somatic, non-synonymous mutations. However, a possibility by which 2HG might contribute to tumorigenesis emerges from consideration of the tumor subtypes in which IDH mutations are found with high frequency: gliomas with mixed astrocytic and oligodendroglial features, and acute myeloid leukemias. In both cases, proliferation of a relatively undifferentiated cell population is central to the disease, and pathogenesis is marked by a block to differentiation rather than simply by an increase in proliferative rate. Thus, one may speculate that 2HG’s effect in the tumor and its microenvironment is to block cellular differentiation. Whether cells carrying a mutant IDH transgene exhibit a block to differentiation in vivo will need to be examined. The production of lineage-specific mutant IDH transgenic animals or hematopoetic bone marrow reconstitution following retroviral introduction of a mutant IDH will allow future studies to test this hypothesis.  Whether 2HG fits into the broad class of mutagens or plays a distinct role in carcinogenesis remains to be determined. For now, it appears to represent a highly correlative maker for an emerging class of somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes. Importantly, these mutations appear to define a significant subset of CNS tumors and leukemias. The identification of frequent IDH2 mutations in AML increases the significance of this family of mutations in understanding the pathogenesis of AML. Taken together, IDH mutations occur in 23% of samples analyzed here. All IDH mutations reported to date share the neomorphic ability to produce high levels of tumor 2HG. Future studies are required to understand the role of 2HG in leukemic transformation and to elucidate the role of IDH1/IDH2 in the pathogenesis of AML.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Patient selection and statistical analysis  Patient samples were obtained from either the Stem Cell and Xenotransplantation Core Facility of the University of Pennsylvania or from the tissue collections of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute. Approval was obtained from the institutional review boards at the University of Pennsylvania (IRB protocol 703185) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute (IRB protocols 95–091 and 06–107), and informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All samples were collected after de-identification for these studies. For assessing clinical and genetic parameters of IDH1/2 wild-type and mutant AML, 78 serial samples from AML patients referred for molecular testing at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were examined. For 2HG assays, patient samples were obtained from the Stem Cell and Xenotransplantation Core Facility of the University of Pennsylvania. The initial 18 samples were selected from de-identified AML patients aged 50 years or older at diagnosis with lesions determined to have normal cytogenetic status. Cells used for these assays were prepared by Ficoll separation of mononuclear cells (MNCs) from peripheral blood or bone marrow. MNCs were frozen as viable cells in 10% DMSO. Student’s t test and Chi-square analysis were used to analyze data. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.  Sequence Analysis of IDH1 and IDH2  Genomic DNA was extracted from bone marrow mononuclear cells or from sorted leukemic cells; for samples with less than 70% blasts flow cytometric sorting (FACSAria) was used to isolate blast cells according to leukemic blast immunophenotype before DNA isolation. High-throughput DNA sequence analysis was used to screen for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. All DNA samples were whole genome amplified using Ø29 polymerase and mutations were validated on unamplified DNA to ensure all mutations were present in the diagnostic sample. Sequencing of IDH1 used primers which cover amino acid residues 41–138 (sense, 5’-TGTGTTGAGATGGACGCCTA-3’; antisense, 5’-GGTGTACTCAGAGCCTTCGC-3’). Sequencing of IDH2 used primers which cover amino acid residues 125–226 (sense, 5’-CTGCCTCTTTGTGGCCTAAG-3’; antisense, 5’-ATTCTGGTTGAAAGATGGCG-3’). Sequence analysis was performed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College PA) and all mutations were validated by repeat PCR and sequencing on unamplified DNA from the archival sample.  Structural modeling  Human IDH2 has 97% homology with pig IDH2, and none of the 13 residues that are different (out of 418 total, excluding the N-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence) are found in the active site. A PDB structure of pig IDH2 is available, with isocitrate in the active site (1LWD) (Ceccarelli et al., 2002). Based on the highly homologous pig structure, conservative structural models of human IDH2 were built with the CHARMM molecular mechanics package using the CHARMM27 force field. To model wild-type IDH2 with isocitrate, the 13 residues of 1LWD differing between pig and human were first changed to the human sequence. The side chains were then rebuilt, hydrogen atoms added to all residues, the substrate, active site Mn2+ ions, and conserved residues were restrained, and the structure minimized allowing only the changed residues to relax. For the α-ketoglutarate complexes, the substrate conformation/pose was first modeled on isocitrate by removing the β-carboxyl group and replacing it with a hydrogen. The wild-type IDH2-α-ketoglutarate complex was then minimized allowing only the active site residues (as defined in entry 1LWD) and substrate to relax. The R140Q mutant IDH2-α-ketoglutarate complex was subsequently modeled by changing arginine 140 to glutamine, and rebuilding the side chain. The structure was then minimized in two stages. First the mutated residue was allowed to relax, followed by a second relaxation of the active site residues, Mn2+, and substrate. All modeling images were generated using PyMOL Viewer (DeLano, 2002).  Constructing IDH1 and IDH2 mutants  The cDNA clone of human IDH2 (BC009244) was purchased from Invitrogen in pOTB7. Human IDH1 (BC012846.1) was purchased from ATCC in pCMV-Sport6. Standard site-directed mutagenesis techniques were used to generate IDH2 R172K by introducing a g515a change in the IDH2 open reading frame (ORF). IDH1 R132H was made by introducing a g395a base pair change in the IDH1 ORF. Wild-type and mutant sequences were then subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and confirmed by direct sequencing before expression in mammalian cells.  Cell culture, transfection, and metabolic labeling  293T cells and Bcl-xL-transfected SF188 cells (SF188) were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (CellGro). For expression of wild-type and mutant IDH1 and IDH2, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For IDH siRNA experiments, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMax, with oligonucleotides obtained from Sigma-Proligo. For metabolic labeling experiments, cells were cultured in glutamine-free DMEM supplemented with 4 mM [13C-U]-L-glutamine (Cambridge Isotope) for the 3h prior to metabolite extraction.  Cell lysate based enzyme assays  For IDH2 enzymatic assays, cells were lysed 48 h following transfection, using mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma). Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000g at 4 °C. Supernatants were then collected and normalized for total protein concentration. To measure IDH oxidative activity, 0.3 µg of lysate protein was added to 200 µl of an assay solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1.3 mM MnCl2, 0.33 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM β-NADP+, and 0.1 mM D-(+)-threo-isocitrate. The increase in 340 nm absorbance (OD340) as a measure of NADPH production was measured every 20 s for 30 min on a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Data are plotted as the mean activity of 3 replicates per lysate averaged among 5 time points centered at every 5 minutes. To measure IDH reductive activity, 3 µg of lysate protein was added to 200 µl of an assay solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.3 mM MnCl2, 0.01 mM β-NADPH, and 0.5 mM α-ketoglutarate. NADPH consumption was measured as the decrease in OD340, with 3 replicates per lysate. For all experiments, OD340 changes in assay buffer lacking lysate protein were measured and subsequently subtracted from the OD340 changes measured in lysate replicates to arrive at final values.  Western blot  To measure IDH2 levels in cell lysates used for enzymatic assays, aliquots of the same lysates used in activity measurements were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with IDH2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam, ab55271), and then detected with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare, NA931V). For assessing IDH knockdown in siRNA experiments, cells treated in parallel with those used for labeling or proliferative studies were lysed 48 h following transfection in standard RIPA buffer (1% NaDOC, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01 M Tris pH 8.0, 0.14 M NaCl), and then probed with IDH2 antibody as above, IDH1 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc49996), or IDH3A rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, ab58641). Actin antibody (Santa Cruz, sc1616) was also used to assess equal protein loading of Western blots.  Metabolite extraction  Cellular organic acids were extracted as previously described (Bennett et al., 2008). Briefly, after gentle removal of culture medium from proliferating cells, or freezing medium from frozen viable AML samples, cells were rapidly quenched with 80% methanol, chilled to −80°C, and then incubated at −80°C for 15 min. Extracts were subsequently transferred and centrifuged at 14,000g for 20 min. at 4°C. The organic acid pool in the supernatant was further purified by drying under nitrogen gas, redissolving in deionized water, and then elution from an AG-1 ×8 100–200 anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad) in 3 N HCl after washing with five column volumes. For media analysis, culture medium from transfected cells 24–48 h following transfection was collected and diluted five-fold with methanol. After centrifugation at 14,000g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated protein, supernatants were dried under nitrogen gas, and organic acids were purified as described above.  Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis  After drying the HCl eluate, samples were redissolved in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA; Regis) and heated for 1 h at 60°C to derivatize prior to GC-MS analysis. Samples were injected into an Agilent 7890A GC with an HP-5MS capillary column, connected to an Agilent 5975C Mass selective detector operating in splitless mode using electron impact ionization with ionizing voltage of −70 eV and electron multiplier set to 1060 V. GC temperature was started at 100 °C for 3 min, ramped to 230 °C at 4 °C/min and held for 4 min, then ramped to 300 °C and held for 5 min. Mass range of 50–500 amu was recorded at 2.71 scans/sec. Isotopic enrichment in citric acid was monitored using ions at m/e− 463 and 464 for citrate +4 and citrate +5 (containing 4 and 5 13C-enriched atoms, respectively), formed through loss of a t-butyl (−57 amu) and t-butyldimethylsilanol (−132 amu) from the molecular ion tetra-TBDMS-citric acid (648 amu). Isotopomer distributions were simultaneously corrected for naturally occurring heavy isotopes of all elements in each mass fragment using a correction matrix as previously described (Weckwerth, 2007). Identification of the 2HG metabolite peak was confirmed using standards obtained from Sigma. 2HG and glutamate signal intensities were quantified by integration of peak areas.  Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)  Organic acids from cellular extracts were purified as described above, followed by evaporation to dryness under nitrogen. After redissolving samples in deionized water, citrate was detected on two different LC-MS approaches, both of which gave comparable results. In both cases, LC separation was by reversed phase chromatography using tributylamine as an ion pairing agent (Lu et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2007) with ionization by negative electrospray at 23 kV. The first MS approach used a Thermo Discovery Max triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode, with citrate quantified using the reaction 191 → 87 at 20 eV. Additional reactions for every possible labeled form of citrate were also monitored using variations of the same transition. Reactions used to monitor other TCA components have been described previously (Bajad et al., 2006). The second MS approach used a Thermo Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer operated at 100,000 mass resolving power, with citrate and its isotope-labeled forms quantified based on extracted ion chromatograms at their exact masses.  SIGNIFICANCE  Most cancer-associated enzyme mutations result in either catalytic inactivation or constitutive activation. Here we report that the common feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations observed in AML and glioma is the acquisition of an enzymatic activity not shared by either wild-type enzyme. The product of this neomorphic enzyme activity can be readily detected in tumor samples and we show that tumor metabolite analysis can identify patients with tumor-associated IDH mutations. Using this method, we discovered a 2HG-producing IDH2 mutation, IDH2 R140Q, that was present in 9% of serial AML samples. Overall, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were observed in over 23% of AML patients.  HIGHLIGHTS  All IDH mutations reported in cancer share a common neomorphic enzymatic activity. Both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 are required for cell proliferation. IDH2 R140Q mutations occur in 9% of AML cases. Overall, IDH2 mutations appear more common than IDH1 mutations in AML.  Mutations in Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 are among the most common genetic alterations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC), a deadly liver cancer1–5. Mutant IDH proteins in IHCC and other malignancies acquire an abnormal enzymatic activity allowing them to convert alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which inhibits the activity of multiple αKG-dependent dioxygenases, and results in alterations in cell differentiation, survival, and extracellular matrix maturation6–10. However, the molecular pathways by which IDH mutations lead to tumour formation remain unclear. Here we show that mutant IDH blocks liver progenitor cells from undergoing hepatocyte differentiation through the production of 2HG and suppression of HNF4α, a master regulator of hepatocyte identity and quiescence. Correspondingly, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) expressing mutant IDH in the adult liver show aberrant response to hepatic injury, characterized by HNF4α silencing, impaired hepatocyte differentiation and markedly elevated levels of cell proliferation. Moreover, mutant IDH and activated Kras, genetic alterations that co-exist in a subset of human IHCCs4,5, cooperate to drive the expansion of liver progenitor cells, development of premalignant biliary lesions, and progression to metastatic IHCC. These studies provide a functional link between IDH mutations, hepatic cell fate, and IHCC pathogenesis, and present a novel GEMM of IDH-driven malignancy.  Gain-of-function IDH1/IDH2 mutations occur in ∼25% of IHCCs1,3–5 but have not been identified in hepatocellular carcinomas (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) — liver malignancies that exhibit bile duct and hepatocyte differentiation, respectively. To examine the role of IDH mutations in liver tumourigenesis we isolated mouse hepatoblasts (HBs), which are embryonic progenitors that give rise to hepatocytes and bile duct cells and show correspondence to adult liver progenitors11,12. HBs expressing mutant IDH1 (R132C, R132H) or IDH2 (R140Q, R172K) produced increased 2HG, but exhibited morphology and proliferation rates indistinguishable from vector and IDH wild type (WT) controls (Extended Data Fig. 1a–d). However, unlike control HBs, which underwent hepatocyte differentiation when transferred from collagen-coated plates to uncoated plates13, forming hepatocyte clusters, decreasing proliferation, and activating a large program of hepatocyte-specific genes including Adh1 and Aldob, IDH mutant cells were refractory to differentiation (Fig. 1a–d, Extended Data Fig. 1e–g). IDH1-R132C and IDH2-R172K caused the most pronounced effects, correlating with relative 2HG levels. Treatment of R132C-expressing HBs with ML309 (AGI-5027), a specific inhibitor of mutant IDH114, attenuated 2HG production (Extended Data Fig. 1h) and restored hepatocyte differentiation (Fig. 1e–f). Conversely, differentiation of WT HBs was counteracted by (R)- or (S)-2HG octyl-esters (Extended Data Fig. 1i–j). In contrast to the complete inhibition of hepatocyte differentiation, mutant IDH did not impair biliary differentiation of HBs in matrigel (Fig. 1g, Extended Data Fig. 1k–l). Thus, mutant IDH specifically blocks hepatocyte lineage progression through 2HG production.  Figure 1 Figure 1 IDH mutant alleles block hepatocyte differentiation To uncover the molecular program underlying these defects, we examined the effect of mutant IDH1/2 on the transcriptome of HBs grown on collagen. Transcriptional profiles of mutant IDH 1 and 2 clustered together and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) demonstrated reduced expression of targets of HNF4α — a master transcriptional regulator of hepatocyte differentiation12 — and of HNF1α which acts downstream of HNF4α15. Moreover, canonical HNF4α and HNF1α binding sites were strongly enriched at the promoters of differentially expressed genes (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a–c).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Mutant IDH blocks hepatocyte differentiation by silencing HNF4α HNF4α has multiple isoforms expressed from separate promoters. The P2 promoter (encoding Hnf4a7-9) is active in hepatoblasts and gradually extinguished in adult hepatocytes, whereas the P1 promoter (encoding Hnf4a1-6) is hepatocyte-specific16. Hnf4a7-9 mRNA and protein were reduced in IDH-mutant HBs, as was expression of HNF4α targets (Extended Data Fig. 2d–g). Moreover, under hepatocyte differentiation conditions, mutant IDH completely inhibited the pronounced induction of HNF4α1-6 and its target OCLN that is observed in control cells (Fig. 2b–c, Extended Data Fig. 2h). Mutant IDH or octyl-2HG treatment blocked Hnf4a1-6 mRNA induction, whereas AGI-5027 restored Hnfa1-6 levels in R132C-expressing cells (Extended Data Fig. 2i–k). Histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4Me3) is associated with active transcription and was specifically reduced at the P1 promoter in R132C HBs, consistent with the observed silencing of Hnf4a1-6, whereas the repressive marks, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, were unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 2l–m and data not shown). Significantly, HNF4α knockdown impaired hepatocyte differentiation of WT HBs without inhibiting biliary differentiation, whereas ectopic HNF4α expression rescued differentiation of IDH-mutant cells (Fig. 2d–h, Extended Data Fig. 2n–o, 3a–b). Thus, mutant IDH alters the epigenetic state of the P1 promoter — through targeting either direct regulators of the locus or more upstream factors — and prevents induction Hnf4a1-6, thereby blocking hepatocyte lineage progression. Notably, HNF4α and HNF1α have critical anti-proliferative and tumour suppressor functions in the adult liver17–20, suggesting the relevance of this pathway to mutant IDH-mediated tumourigenesis and prompting us to extend our studies in vivo.  We generated transgenic mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of IDH2-R140Q or IDH2-R172K (Tet-R140Q, Tet-R172K strains) specifically in adult hepatocytes — R140Q was detected in virtually all hepatocytes and R172K showed more scattered expression, and liver 2HG levels were elevated (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d, ,5a).5a). Since mutant IDH blocks liver progenitors from undergoing hepatocyte differentiation in vitro, we sought to address whether it acts analogously in vivo to specifically override differentiation from a progenitor cell state, or conversely, whether it broadly alters homeostasis of mature hepatocytes. Although normally quiescent, the liver has extensive regenerative capacity following injury involving replication of mature hepatocyte and biliary cells, or activation of bipotential progenitors (oval cells) that may arise from either lineage11,21. In the absence of injury, Tet-R140Q mice were healthy up to 48 weeks, and had normal liver histology, marker expression, proliferation, and liver function (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 5b, and data not shown). By contrast, pronounced defects in restoration of hepatocyte differentiation were observed in mice fed a diet containing 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidin (DDC) for 5 days then switched to normal diet for 3 weeks (Fig. 3a), a protocol causing hepatocyte cell death and transient oval cell activation21,22. Hepatocyte markers including HNF4α were downregulated 3–10-fold, while biliary markers were unchanged, and proliferation was increased >40-fold relative to WT controls (Fig. 3b–d). Despite this depletion of mature hepatocytes, no changes were seen in parameters of liver function (Extended Data Fig. 5c–d and data not shown), consistent with the persistence of hepatocytes surviving short-term DDC treatment and the established capacity of reduced hepatocyte numbers to maintain normal physiology.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Mutant IDH inhibits hepatocyte differentiation and quiescence of liver progenitors Serial analyses of WT and R140Q livers revealed comparable numbers of proliferating periductal HNF4α−/CK19− oval cells at 1 week, and resolution of this population after 3 weeks (Extended Data Fig. 6a–b, and Fig. 3e–f). However, R140Q livers exhibited prominent induction of proliferating non-periductal cells with hepatocyte morphology but reduced or absent HNF4α expression (HNF4α+ and HNF4α−/CK19−), which persisted after 3 weeks (Fig. 3e–f, Extended Data Fig. 6a–d). Similar but more tempered phenotypes were seen in Tet-R172K mice, consistent with focal transgene expression (Extended Data Fig. 6e–f). Thus, mutant IDH specifically blocks restoration of hepatocyte differentiation following acute liver injury, leading to aberrant proliferation in the hepatic parenchyma. As HNF4α levels increase in liver progenitors undergoing hepatocyte commitment23,24, these proliferating HNF4α-low/absent cells appear to be committed progenitors (derived from de-differentiated hepatocytes or oval cells) whose differentiation to hepatocytes is subverted by mutant IDH2. The transgene was not expressed in Sox9+ oval cells, precluding assessment of effects on these earlier progenitors.  We developed an additional transgenic strain (LSL-R172K) expressing human IDH2-R172K in Sox9+ biliary cells but not in hepatocytes (Fig. 3g, Extended Data Fig. 7a–b). These animals displayed normal liver histology, gene expression, and proliferation at 3 months (Extended Data Fig. 7c and data not shown). However, by 20 months of age there was pronounced accumulation of Hnf4α−/Sox9+ oval cells expressing R172K >25µm away from any bile duct or portal structure (zones 2/3) (Fig. 3g). Collectively, our results suggest that mutant IDH2 abrogates differentiation of adult progenitors (activated spontaneously during aging or by injury), specifically blocking hepatocyte lineage progression.  These findings are concordant with our observations in HB cells and suggest that failed HNF4α induction could contribute to the liver phenotypes caused by mutant IDH in vivo. In this regard, acute HNF4α deletion in hepatocytes is reported to provoke hepatocyte differentiation defects and, upon diethylnitrosamine (DEN) treatment, oval cell accumulation and formation of tumours showing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and IHCC morphology20. To expand upon potential parallels with IDH-mutant mice, we characterized these phenotypes in further depth. Significantly, the HCC lesions in DEN-treated HNF4a conditional KO mice were uniformly HNF4α+, indicating that they arose from cells that escaped deletion of the locus (Extended Data Fig. 8a). By contrast, Sox9+ oval cells and CK19+ IHCCs were HNF4α-negative and were never observed in DEN-treated controls (Extended Data Fig. 8b–c). Thus, HNF4α ablation in DEN-treated livers drives progenitor expansion and progression specifically to IHCC. These findings establish Hnf4a as an IHCC tumor suppressor and are consistent with HNF4α acting downstream of mutant IDH in liver growth control.  The capacity of mutant IDH to silence Hnf4a and impair differentiation would be expected to confer sensitivity to transformation by additional oncogenic lesions. In this regard, IDH and KRAS mutations exist concurrently in human IHCC4,5 and AML25. Previously, we showed that KrasG12D expression in mouse liver causes mixed IHCC/HCC with long latency, a phenotype accelerated by p53 deletion26. Intercrossing LSL-R172K, KrasG12D and Alb-Cre mice revealed dramatic oncogenic cooperation, with 6/6 Alb-Cre; LSL-R172K; KrasG12D animals developing poor body condition and palpable liver tumours between 33 and 58 weeks (mean 47.3 weeks; Fig. 4a). Multifocal liver masses with splenic invasion and peritoneal metastases were observed and demonstrated to be IHCC by histopathologic analysis, CK19 staining, and lack of reactivity for the hepatocyte/HCC marker, Hep Par1 (Fig. 4b). By contrast, only 1/7 Alb-Cre; KrasG12D mice sustained a tumour by 70 weeks (mean survival = 81.6 weeks), and solely HCC were detected (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Tumour 2HG levels in R172K mice were comparable to those in IDH-mutant human IHCC1 (Extended Data Fig. 8e).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Mutant IDH cooperates with KrasG12D to drive liver progenitor cell expansion and multi-step IHCC pathogenesis In humans, IHCC is thought to develop from precursor lesions, including biliary intraepithelial neoplasias (BilIN)2. Aberrant oval cell proliferation also precedes liver cancer development in murine models27. Notably, in all Alb-Cre; LSL-R172K; KrasG12D mice analyzed (N=6), the adjacent liver exhibited oval cell expansion and a graded series of BilIN-like lesions, which were Sox9+/CK19+, and expressed the IDH2-R172K transgene at physiologic levels (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 9a–b, 10a). Importantly, neither Alb-Cre; KrasG12D nor Alb-Cre; KrasG12D; p53Lox/+ livers26 showed oval cell expansion, and BilIN were found in only 2/8 Alb-Cre; KrasG12D; p53Lox/+ mice. Thus, IDH2-R172K and KrasG12D cooperatively incite activation of hepatic progenitors and multistage IHCC progression.  In summary, we present a novel GEMM driven by mutant IDH that exhibits the hallmarks of human IHCC. Mutant IDH blocks hepatocyte differentiation from progenitors in vitro, and regulates hepatic regeneration, progenitor cell expansion, and IHCC pathogenesis in vivo. Collectively, our findings are consistent with a model whereby mutant IDH subverts the HNF4α-mediated hepatocyte differentiation/quiescence program in proliferating hepatocytes or bipotential progenitors, creating a persistent pre-neoplastic state primed for transformation by additional oncogenic mutations, and leading to adenocarcinoma specifically with a biliary phenotype (Fig. 4d). While lineage-tracing studies are required to fully define the impact of IDH mutations on different liver cell types, this model predicts that IDH-mutant IHCC may have progenitor-like features, and that IDH mutations occur early in disease pathogenesis as observed in glioblastoma and AML28,29. Accordingly GSEA revealed that IDH-mutant tumors have strong enrichment of a hepatic stem cell expression signature (Extended Data Fig. 10b).  Defining the biologic functions of mutant IDH is of immediate significance as IHCCs are resistant to current treatment. Our GEMM provides an autochthonous context for ‘co-clinical trials’ to help determine the best way to deploy IDH inhibitors and identify biomarkers of response, thereby informing clinical decision-making in this deadly disease.  Go to: METHODS SUMMARY Cell culture  HB cells were prepared from WT mice at embryonic day 14 and subjected to hepatocyte and bile duct differentiation as described13. For proliferation assays, cells were plated in duplicate on collagen-coated or uncoated 6 well plates. Cells were trypsinized and counted by trypan-blue exclusion.  Mice  Mice were housed in pathogen-free animal facilities. Studies were approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care at Mass. General Hospital (protocol 2005N000148). The Tet-R140Q, Tet-R172K, and LSL-R172K transgenic mice and other strains are presented in the Methods Section. For DDC experiments, mice were maintained on 200 µg/mL doxycycline-containing water. Mice were fed with 0.1% DDC-containing chow (F4643, Bio-serv, Frenchtown, NJ) from days 2–7. Mice were then switched to normal chow until harvest. DEN experiments were performed as described20.  Statistics  Results are expressed as mean ±s.d. unless otherwise specified. Significance was analyzed using 2-tailed Student’s t test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Go to: METHODS Cell culture  HB cells were prepared from WT mice at embryonic day 14 and immortalized by plating at clonal density13. HBs were maintained in HB media [DMEM/F-12 (Gibco Life Technologies, Grand Island NY) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 50ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 30 ng/mL insulin-like growth factor II (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 10 µg/mL insulin (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)] on plates coated with rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C. For IDH1 experiments, culture media was supplemented with 25 ng/mL of doxycycline (d9891, Sigma-Aldrich). For hepatocyte differentiation assays, 5×106 HB cells were cultured on uncoated 10 cm tissue culture dishes in HB cell medium for up to 5 days. Pictures were taken 2–5 days after plating. For bile duct differentiation (matrigel) assays, 0.5 mL of Basement Membrane Matrix (BD) was coated onto 6 cm tissue culture dishes and allowed to set for 1h. Then 0.5×106 HB cells were added to the plate in HB cell media supplemented with 100 ng/mL recombinant mouse hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Tubules were counted after 24hrs. For gene expression analysis, cells were isolated after 10 days. For proliferation assays, cells were plated in duplicate on collagen-coated 6 well dishes (1×104/well) or uncoated 6 well plates (1×105/well) in culture medium. Adherent and non-adherent cells were harvested, trypsinized and counted by trypan-blue exclusion using a Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen) 24, 72 or 120 hrs later. Negative mycoplasma contamination status of all cell lines and primary cells used in the study was established using LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Kit (Sigma, MP0035).  AGI-5027  AGI-5027 (ML309) is a small molecule (phenyl-glycine scaffold) inhibitor of IDH1 R132C and R132H (IC50=30 nm and 68 nm respectively) that does not affect WT IDH1 activity (IC50 >36 µM and was developed by NIH Chemical Genomics Center and Agios Pharmaceuticals14.  Mice  Mice were housed in pathogen-free animal facilities. All experiments were conducted under protocol 2005N000148 approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care at Massachusetts General Hospital. Mice were maintained on mixed 129SV/C57Bl/6 background. Data presented include both male and female mice. All mice included in the survival analysis were euthanized when criteria for disease burden were reached.  Albumin-Cre transgenic mice This strain30 harbors a transgene in which the mouse albumin enhancer/promoter drives Cre recombinase. Cre activity is inefficient at birth, but leads to progressive deletion of floxed sequences in all liver lineages by 4–6 weeks of age.  Rosa26-LSL-rtTA31 mice In this strain, the doxycycline-responsive reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) is knocked into the transcriptional start site at the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 locus and is preceded by a lox-stop-lox (LSL) casette.  KrasG12D mice32 This allele consists of a mutant KrasG12D allele knocked into the endogenous Kras locus, preceded by an LSL cassette.  IDH mutant transgenic mouse models To generate transgenic mice, the R140Q and R172K mutations were introduced into human IDH2 cDNA (Origene, Rockville, MD # SC319226, accession# NM_002168) using the Quickchange kit (Agilent Lexington, MA #200521) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Two different transgenic targeting approaches were used.  Doxycycline inducible models To generate the doxycycline-inducible Tet-R140Q and Tet-R172K strains (Extended Data Fig. 4), IDH2-R140Q cDNA was cloned into the pBS31 Prime transgenic targeting vector (Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems, #MES4487). A modified version of pBS31 containing a floxed stop cassette was used for the IDH2-R172K mice. The targeting vectors were co-electroporated into C2 mouse embryonic stem cells (Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems, #MES4305) with a plasmid expressing FLPE recombinase (pCAGGS-FlpE, Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems, Waltham MA, #MES4488) as described33. This system involves single copy integration of the transgene downstream of the Collagen-1 locus, and within the liver, results in expression in hepatocytes but not in bile ducts33. ES cells were screened for integration of the transgene by PCR and correctly targeted ES cells were injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts. Chimeras were crossed to the Albumin-Cre strain30, and offspring were successively crossed with Rosa26-LSL-rtTA31, and LSL-KrasG12D mice32. We confirmed the expected expression of the R140Q (Extended Data Figure. 4b–c) and R172K transgenes (Extended Data Fig. 4d) in the adult hepatocytes and lack of expression in bile ducts. Stably expressed model: To generate mice with a conditionally active IDH2-R172K allele (LSL-R172K), human IDH2-R172K was cloned into a modified version of the PGK-ATG-Frt vector (Open Biosystems, Waltham MA, #MES4490) containing the CAGGS promoter for stable expression (Extended Data Fig 7a)34. Gene targeting and chimeric mouse generation was as above. This strain was successively crossed with Albumin-Cre and LSL-KrasG12D animals. This transgene was specifically expressed in bile ducts and oval cells (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 7b). We did not observe developmental anomalies in these mice, although the inefficiency of recombination induced by the Alb-Cre strain in neonates and the restricted activity of the transgene in this system precludes definitive assessment of potential effects of mutant IDH2 on the embryonic liver.  DDC treatment  For DDC experiments, 4-week old mice were treated with 200 µg/mL doxycycline-containing water. 2 days later, mice were fed with 0.1% DDC-containing chow (F4643, Bio-serv, Frenchtown, NJ) for 5 days. The mice were then switched to normal chow and maintained on doxycycline-containing water until harvest 1 or 3 weeks later. Randomization was done according to genotype and blinding was applied during histological analysis. No mice were excluded from the analysis. Sample sizes were chosen to achieve statistical significance yet use the fewest animals possible to minimize suffering.  Statistics  Results are expressed as mean ±s.d. between two technical replicates, unless otherwise specified. Significance was analyzed using 2-tailed Student’s t test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Plasmids  Human wild-type IDH1 cDNA (Accession# NM_005896) was obtained from Origene and subcloned into pRetro-Puro using EcoRI and BamHI fragments. Human wild-type IDH2, R140Q and R172K cDNA (Origene) were subcloned into pRetro-puro and pMSCV-blast (derived by replacing the puromycin resistance gene from pMSCV-puro with a blasticidin resistance gene) (both from Clontech, Mountain View CA) using EcoRI and XhoI. Human IDH1 R132C was generated from wild-type IDH1 using QuikChange Lightning kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and primers 5’-GATGGGTAAAACC TATCATCATAGGTTGTCATGCTTATGGGGATCAATAC-3’ for sense and 5’-GTATTGATCCCCATAAGCATGACAACCTATGATGATAGGTTTTACCCATC-3’ for antisense. pLVX-Tet-On was obtained from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Murine Hnf4a was obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA) and cloned into pRetro-blast (derived by replacing the puromycin resistance with blasticidin) as a BglII-EcoRI fragment. Lentiviral (pLKO.1) Hnf4α shRNA vectors TRCN0000026154, target sequence: 5’-CGACAATGTGTGGTAGACAAA-3’ and TRCN0000026216, target sequence: 5’-GCAGATTGATGACAATGAATA-3’ were used as shHnf4a#1 and shHnf4a#2, respectively, and were obtained from the Broad Institute TRC shRNA library. pLKO.1 shRNA with target sequence 5’-GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCAT-3’ was used as negative control shRNA. Hnf4α resistant to shHnf4a#2 was generated using QuikChange Lightning kit and primers 5’-GCCCTTCCAAGAGCTGCAGA TCGACGATAACGAATATGCCTGCCTCAAAGCC-3’ for sense and 5’-GGCTTTGAGGCAGGCATATTCGTTATCGTCGATCTGCAGCTCTTGGAAGGGC-3’ for antisense.  Immunoblot analysis  Cell extracts were prepared in 1x RIPA buffer (150mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1%SDS, 50mM Tris, 0.5% DOC) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Sets I and II, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and quantified by BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). 30 µg protein was resolved on 9% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% non-fat milk and 0.1% Tween and probed with anti-IDH1 polyclonal antibody (3997S, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-IDH2 polyclonal antibody (ab84726, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-occludin (71-1500, Invitrogen), anti-HNF4α (1-6) monoclonal antibody (ab41898, Abcam), anti-HNF4α(1–6)/NP2A1 monoclonal antibody (PP-K9218-00, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-HNF4α(7–9) monoclonal antibody (PP-H6939-00, R&D Systems), or anti-βactin monoclonal antibody (A5316, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as loading control. Bound proteins were detected with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Biolaboratories, Burlingame, CA) and SuperSignal West Pico Luminol/Enhancer Solution (Thermo Scientific).  RNA analysis  Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA synthesis was performed with the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) with 1µg total RNA. Sense and antisense for amplification of target genes included: Alb (5’-CATGCCAAATTAGTGCAGGA-3’ and 5’-GCTGGGGTTGTCATCTTTGT-3’); Aldob (5’-TGTCTGGAGGTATGAGTGAGG-3’ and 5’-CTGGGTTGCCTTCTTGTTTGC-3’); Adh1 (5’-GTGACTTGTGTGAAACCAGGT-3’ and 5’-GCTACAAAAGTTGCTTTCCGGG-3’); Ggt1 (5’-CTTGTGCGAGGTGTTCTGC-3’ and 5’-GCATAGTCACCGTCTCTCCTT-3’); Bgp (5’-CAAAAGGAGGCCTCTCAGAT-3’ and 5’-GCTGAGGGTTTGTGCTCTGT-3’); Hnf4α(1–6) (5’-GGTAGGGGAGAATGCGACTC-3’ and 5’-AAACTCCAGGGTGGTGTAGG-3’); Foxm1 (5’-ATCGCTACTTGACATTGGACCA-3’ and 5’-GATTGGGTCGTTTCTGCTGTG-3’); Krt19 (5’-TGCTGGATGAGCTGACTCTG-3’ and 5’-AATCCACCTCCACACTGACC-3’); Onecut1 (5’-GGCAACGTGAGCGGTAGTTT-3’ and 5’-TTGCTGGGAGTTGTGAATGCT-3’); Arg1 (5’-TTGGGTGGATGCTCACACTG-3’ and 5’-GTACACGATGTCTTTGGCAGA-3’); C2 (5’-GGAACCCATTTGCCGACAG-3’ and 5’-GGCCCAAACTTTTTGTCAGAAG-3’); C7 (5’-GCAGGAAAGTGTTCAGCGG-3’ and 5’-CATGACCGTAAGTATTCCGTGAG-3’); C9 (5’-CATGCCGTGACCGAGTAGC-3’ and 5’-TCACAGAGTCCGTTGTAGAACT-3’); Krt7 (5’-CACCCGGAATGAGATTGCG-3’ and 5’-GCACGCTGGTTCTTCAAGGT-3’); Sprr1a (5’-TTGTGCCCCCAAAACCAAG-3’ and 5’-GGCTCTGGTGCCTTAGGTTG-3’); Ttr (5’-CACCAAATCGTACTGGAAGACA-3’ and 5’-GTCGTTGGCTGTGAAAACCAC-3’); ApoB (5’-TGGCTCTGATCCCAAATCCCT-3’ and 5’-GCTGCTCCTTGGCAGTATTAAA-3’); Cyp3a13 (5’-GACCACAAGCAGTGCTCTTTC-3’ and 5’-GCAGGGTATCATAGGTGGCAG-3’).  Gene expression profiling and gene-set enrichment analysis  Gene expression of HBs expressing IDH1 WT, IDH1 R132C, IDH2 WT, R172K and empty vector controls (N=2 cultures for each condition) grown on collagen-coated plates, as well as IDH1 R132C and empty vector controls grown on uncoated plates, was evaluated using Affymetrix Mouse 430Av2 DNA microarrays (DFCI Microarray core facility). Raw expression values were processed and normalized using RMA in the R Bioconductor package. This dataset is available in GEO (GSE57002). Differentially expressed genes in IDH1 R132C and IDH2 R172K expressing HBs were identified using the signal-to-noise metric. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the expression data was used to uncover the molecular program accounting for the differentiation defects. GSEA was performed using two libraries from version 3.1 of the molecular signature database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp): the c2 curated gene sets from online pathway databases, PubMed publications, knowledge of domain experts and the c3 motif gene sets. Pairwise GSEA analysis such as shown in Fig. 2a was performed by creating ranked lists of genes using the log2 ratio of mutant IDH samples to vector or WT control and running GSEA in the ranked list mode. The heat map in Fig. 2a presents the gene-sets that distinguish IDH1 R132C or IDH2 R172K as compared to cells expressing WT IDH1 or IDH2 or EV. Each column represents pairwise analysis of HB cells expressing mutant IDH (IDH1 R132C or IDH2 R172K) with either EV (left columns) or WT IDH (right columns) control cells for two independent replicates of each sample. All other results were obtained using GSEA to rank genes according to signal-to-noise ratio between mutant IDH samples and controls. Statistical significance for GSEA results were obtained from permuting gene sets (1000 permutations). Gene sets of ‘Hepatocyte Genes’ for the GSEA results shown in Extended Data Fig. 1g were created from expression data from Shin, et al. 201137. The expression data was downloaded from GEO (GSE28891) in series matrix form and loaded into R. Undifferentiated, differentiated hepatocytes, and primary hepatocyte samples were selected from GSE28891 (4 samples of each type for a total of 12). Within that sample subset, the normalized signal intensities were thresholded to a minimum value of 10 and features were filtered out if they had less than 3 fold difference between minimum and maximum values or had absolute differences less than 50 between minimum and maximum values (leaving 21277 features out of 37908). A t-test was performed between the undifferentiated and the combined differentiated and primary hepatocyte samples and p-values from the t-test were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (in R using the Bioconductor multtest package). This left 206 features up and 407 down in the hepatocyte direction with an adjusted BH p-value < 0.01 which are represented by 133 and 311 unique gene symbols respectively. 96 of these genes were represented on the murine Affymetrix array. The feature list was made into a gene set labeled as ‘Hepatocyte Genes’ and is shown in Supplementary Table 1.  Chromatin Immunoprecipitation  5×106 EV, IDH1 WT or R132C-expressing HBs were transferred from collagen-coated to uncoated plates for 5 days and fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at 37°C. Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of glycine at a final concentration of 125mM for 5min. Cells were then harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Chromatin extraction, DNA sonication, and immunoprecipitation were performed using a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay Kit (17-295, Millipore, Temecula, CA) and ChIPAb+ Trimethyl-Histone H3 (Lys4) (17-614, Millipore) or Tri-Methyl-Histone H3 (Lys4) Antibody (Cell Signaling, #9727S) validated antibody. Sense and antisense for amplification of target genomic regions included: Hhex (5’-GAAGGAGCCTGACCCTTTCC-3’ and 5’-ATCAGCAGCGTGCACTACTC-3’); Hoxa10 (5’-AACAGTAAAGCTTCGCCGGA-3’ and 5’-AGTTCAGAAGGTCAGCCTGC-3’); Hnf4a P1 (5’-AACATGGCCCTATCTTCGGG-3’ and 5’-AAACGCACACCGCTATGTTG-3’).  Histology and Immunostaining  Tissue samples were fixed overnight in 4% buffered formaldehyde, and then embedded in paraffin and sectioned (5 µm thickness) by the DF/HCC Research Pathology Core. Hematoxylin & eosin staining was performed using standard methods. For immunohistochemistry, unstained slides were baked at 55°C overnight, deparaffinized in xylenes (2 treatments, 6 min each), rehydrated sequentially in ethanol (5 min in 100%, 3 min in 95%, 3 min in 75%, and 3 min in 40%), and washed for 5 min in 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS (PBST) and 3 min in water. For antigen unmasking, specimens were cooked in a 2100 Antigen Retriever (Aptum Biologics Ltd, Southampton, UK) in 1X Antigen Unmasking Solution, Citric Acid Based (H-3300, Vector Laboratories), rinsed 3 times with PBST, incubated for 10 min with 1% H2O2 at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase activity, washed 3 times with PBST, and blocked with 5% goat serum in PBST for 1h. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution as follows: anti-R172K (26163, New East Biosciences) 1:100, anti-R140Q (26165 New East Biosciences) 1:100, anti-IDH2 (NBP2-22166, Novus Biologicals) 1:100, anti-HNF4α monoclonal antibody (PP-K9218-00, R&D Systems) 1:250, anti-CK19 (Troma3) 1:100; anti-Sox9 (ab5535, Millipore), 1:300; or anti-Ki67 (ab15580, Abcam), 1:100 and incubated with the tissue sections at 4°C overnight. Specimens were then washed 3 times for 3 min each in PBST and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) in blocking solution for 1h at room temperature. Then, specimens were washed 3 times in PBST and treated with ABC reagent (Vectastain ABC kit #PK-6100) for 30 min, followed by 3 washes for 3 min each. Finally, slides were stained for peroxidase for 3 min with the DAB (Di-amine-benzidine) substrate kit (SK-4100, Vector Laboratories), washed with water and counterstained with hematoxylin. Stained slides were photographed with an Olympus DP72 microscope. For Immunofluorescence studies of tissue specimens, antigen unmasking was performed in 1X Antigen Retrieval Buffer, Tris-EDTA Buffer, pH 9.0 (ab93684, Abcam), rinsed briefly with dH2O, washed for 5min in PBS, followed by 5 min in 0.05% Tween-20/TBS (TBST). Specimens were then blocked using 0.5% blocking reagent (FP1020, PerkinElmer) diluted in TBS (TNB) for 1h and incubated in primary antibodies at 4°C overnight in TNB, followed by 3 min washes in TBST and 1h incubation in secondary antibodies (1:400) diluted in TNB. Finally, specimens were rinsed 3 × 5 min in TBST and mounted using mounting media with DAPI (H-1500, Vectashield Vector Laboratories). For cell culture staining, samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 20 min followed by washing four times in PBS. Residual paraformaldehyde was removed with three 5-min washes with 100 mM glycine in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS and blocked for 30 min with blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, PBS). Coverslips were incubated with primary (1:100) and secondary (1:1000) antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h and 40 min, respectively, at room temperature, and nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Coverslips were mounted with immu-mount (Thermo-Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Sox9 (1:500; Millipore AB5535); goat anti-HNF4α (SC6556, 1:250; Santa Cruz). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa-488, 555 or 647 (Life Technologies). Confocal images were captured by a scanning laser confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti; Nikon) using 40× or 60× oil lenses and captured using NIS-Elements software (Nikon). Images were processed using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop CS4. For quantification of signal intensity ratios, channel intensities of individual cells were selected from at least 60 cells per sample from at 3- 5 images using the Measure RGB plugin of ImageJ and exported into Excel for further analysis.  2HG production and measurement  2HG-octyl esters were prepared from commercially available 2HG lactones (CAS# 21461-84-7 (S-) and 53558-93-3 (R-)). Esterification of lactone with 1-octanol and EDCI (CAS# 25952-53-8), followed by opening of the lactone with lithium hydroxide in tetrahydrofuran/water, yielded the 2HG-octyl esters (free carboxylic acid) upon neutralization and chromatographic purification. The sodium salts of both 2HG-octyl esters are available from Toronto Research Chemicals. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using an AB Sciex 4000 (Framingham, MA) operating in negative electrospray mode. MRM data were acquired for each compound using the following transitions: 2HG (146.9/128.8 amu), 13C5-2HG (151.9/133.8 amu) and 3HMG (160.9/98.9 amu). Chromatographic separation was performed using an ion-exchange column (Bio-Rad Fast Acid Analysis, 9µm, 7.8 mm X 100 mm; Bio-Rad). The flow rate was 1ml/min of 0.1 % formic acid in water with a total run time of 4 minutes. Samples were prepared as follows: Tissues were weighed out and homogenized in appropriate volumes of PBS using Tissue Lyser (Qiagen). 10µl of homogenate were extracted by adding 200µl of methanol with 200 ng/ml 3HMG as internal standard. Cell pellets containing 1×106 cells each were resuspended in specified volumes of 80:20 MeOH:water, centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000 rpm. 30µl of supernatant were extracted by adding 170µl of methanol with 200 ng/ml 13C5-2HG as internal standard. All sample types were then vortexed, centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 5°C and 150µl of supernatant transferred to a clean 96-well plate. The samples were dried down and reconstituted in 200µl 0.1% formic acid in water, and 10 µl injected on a column.  Human samples and genomic studies  An initial cohort of 149 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples was obtained from ICC patients resected between 1995 and 2007 at three centers from the HCC Genomic Consortium: IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori (Milan), Mount Sinai School of Medicine (New York), and Hospital Clinic (Barcelona). Pathological diagnosis of ICC was confirmed by two independent liver pathologists (MS and ST). DNA and RNA extraction from human tissue, whole-genome gene-expression profiling (DASL assay Illumina), and the Infinium FFPE restoration kit (Illumina) are extensively described elsewhere36. The study protocol was approved at each center’s Institutional Review Board. A total of 127 samples had available data for both gene expression and DNA copy number changes and were analyzed for molecular characterization to define molecular-based classes. IDH1 and 2 mutations occurring at Arginine residue 132 and 172 respectively were analyzed by PCR technique using primers 5’-GTGGCACGGTCTTCAGAGA-3’ (forward primer) and 5’- TGCTTAATGGGTGTAGATACCAA-3’ (reverse primer), and 5’-GCCCACACATTTGCACTCTA-3’ (forward primer) and 5’-AAGGAAAGCCACGAGACAGA-3’ (reverse primer). The PCR amplifications were performed in a volume of 25µL reaction mixture containing 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.2mM of each dNTP, 0.125mM of each primer and 1U of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR products were purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 3700 DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM® 3730XL; Applied Biosystems). Good quality sanger sequencing data for both IDH1 and IDH2 was obtained for 107 ICC DNA samples and has been included in all the subsequent analyses.  Human Gene Set Enrichment Analysis  Genes, molecular pathways, and gene expression signatures associated with the classes were evaluated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for Molecular Signature Database gene sets (MSigDB, www.broadinstitute.org/msigdb). Data analysis was conducted using the GenePattern Analytical Toolkit37, whereas correlation with clinico-pathological parameters was performed with SPSS software® (version 18) as previously described36.

Normalized enrichment plot of a cohort of 127 human IHCC samples genotyped for IDH status, showing that the subset of tumors with IDH1/IDH2 mutations exhibits enrichment of a gene signature40 that identifies IHCCs with hepatic stem cell/progenitor features.  Mutations in the metabolic enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) and IDH2 that produce the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) occur frequently in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 2-HG modulates numerous biological pathways implicated in malignant transformation, but the contribution of mutant IDH proteins to maintenance and progression of AML in vivo is currently unknown. To answer this crucial question we have generated transgenic mice that express IDH2R140Q in an on/ off- and tissue-specific manner using a tetracycline-inducible system. We found that IDH2R140Q can cooperate with overexpression of HoxA9 and Meis1a and with mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) to drive acute leukemia in vivo. Critically, we show that genetic deinduction of mutant IDH2 in leukemic cells in vivo has profound effects on their growth and/or maintenance. Our data demonstrate the proto-oncogenic role of mutant IDH2 and support its relevance as a therapeutic target for the treatment of human AML.

Mutations in active site arginines of IDH1 and IDH2 have recently been identified in ~20% of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; Mardis et al., 2009), as well as in a range of other malignancies including glioblastoma, chondrosarcoma, and prostate cancer (Amary et al., 2011; Kang et al., 2009; Parsons et al., 2008). Mutations confer on the enzymes a novel ability to produce D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), a molecule that is structurally similar to α-KG and can act as a competitive inhibitor of α-KG-dependent dioxygenases that in turn regulate a wide array of biological processes including DNA and histone demethylation, collagen maturation, and the hypoxic response (Dang et al., 2009; Ward et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2011). In AML, patient IDH mutations are associated with a normal karyotype and often co-occur with other genetic lesions including internal tandem duplication in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3ITD) and mutations that promote the cytoplasmic localization of Nucleo-phosmin 1 (NPMc+) (Patel et al., 2012).  Mutant IDH proteins have been proposed as attractive drug targets and molecules that block the production of 2-HG have recently been reported (Popovici-Muller et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). Expression of mutant IDH1 or IDH2 proteins is sufficient to block differentiation of hematopoietic cells in vitro as well as in vivo and can be reversed by inhibitor treatment (Figueroa et al., 2010; Losman et al., 2013; Sasaki et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). Retroviral transduction of IDH mutations in combination with additional oncogenes into primary mouse bone marrow cells followed by transplantation have been shown to drive leukemia development (Chaturvedi et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013); however, the central question of whether mutant IDH1 and IDH2 proteins are required for leukemia maintenance in vivo remains yet to be answered. Herein we address this question through the generation and characterization of transgenic murine models where expression of IDH2R140Q is conditional and regulatable.  Go to: RESULTS Generation and Characterization of IDH2R140Q Transgenic Mice  To develop a mouse model of IDH2R140Q mutation that has the capacity to be both tissue-specific and on/off-inducible, we used the tetracycline response element (TRE)/tetracycline trans-activator (tTA) system. Briefly, the IDH2R140Q cDNA was cloned downstream of a TRE followed by a protamine-1 polyA cassette (Fisher et al., 2001) and targeted into the mouse Collagen A1 locus of C2-embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using Flp-recombinase-mediated genomic integration (Beard et al., 2006) (Figure 1A and S1A available online). Chimeric mice harboring the inducible IDH2R140Q allele were backcrossed into the C57BL/6 background and then crossed to mice that constitutively express the M2 reverse tTA from the ROSA26 locus (ROSA26-M2) (Hochedlinger et al., 2005). Compound IDH2R140Q+/−; ROSA26-M2+/− (hereafter referred to as IDH2R140Qt) were born at Mendelian ratios (data not shown) and appeared normal and were compared to single transgenic (i.e., IDH2R140Q+/− or ROSA26-M2+/−) or wild-type littermates (hereafter referred to as controls).  Figure 1 Figure 1 IDH2R140Q–t Mice Demonstrate Extramedullary Hematopoiesis Characterized by Spleen Enlargement and Expansion of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells Due to the documented frequency of IDH mutations in AML patients (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; Mardis et al., 2009; Patel et al., 2012), we chose to focus specifically on the hematopoietic system of our transgenic mice. IDH2R140Q expression was induced in animals at ~3 weeks of age by introducing doxycycline in the chow. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) using primers specific for the trans-gene confirmed IDH2R140Q mRNA expression in both mature and immature bone marrow cells from IDH2R140Qt animals (Figure S1C). Western blot analysis using an antibody that recognizes both the mutant IDH2R140Q and the endogenous wild-type IDH2 proteins revealed that the total levels of IDH2 in the bone marrow of IDH2R140Q-t animals were increased by approximately 2-fold in comparison with controls (Figure S1B). Because the level of endogenous Idh2 mRNA was unaffected by transgene expression (data not shown), these data suggest that the ratio of wild-type to mutant protein in our system is approximately 1:1.  The IDH2R140Q mutation, as well as other cancer-associated mutations in IDH1 and IDH2, has been shown to lead to the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (Dang et al., 2009; Ward et al., 2010). 2-HG accumulates in IDH mutant cancer cells at low mM concentrations and can also be detected in the serum of patients with mutant IDH AML (Gross et al., 2010). We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to quantify 2-HG in both serum (Figure S1E) and isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNCs) (Figure 1B) from our mice. As expected, high levels of 2-HG were detected only in IDH2R140Q–t animals.  To confirm that transgene expression and 2-HG production could be reversed in vivo, mice that had been on a doxycycline diet for a period of 8 weeks were placed on a diet without doxycycline for 2 weeks. Following this period of deinduction, both transgene expression and serum 2-HG levels dropped significantly and returned almost to basal levels (Figures S1D and S1E). Together these data demonstrate that we have generated an inducible model of the cancer-associated IDH2R140Q mutation in which transgene expression and the consequent production of 2-HG can be regulated by administration of doxycycline.  Expression of IDH2R140Q in the Bone Marrow Results in Aberrant Hematopoiesis in Vivo  In order to establish the impact of IDH2R140Q expression on normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) as well as lineage development in vivo, we undertook a detailed analysis of hematopoiesis in our transgenic animals. Eight weeks after transgene induction, IDH2R140Q–t and control peripheral blood cell counts showed no differences (Figures S1F–S1H). Likewise, there were no alterations in the numbers of hematopoietic stem cells, myeloid progenitors, or mature B, T, or myeloid cells in the bone marrow (Figures S1I–S1O). However, the spleens of IDH2R140Q–t mice were approximately 1.3-fold larger (99.05 ± 4.851 mg versus 77.69 ± 4.54 mg for the controls; p < 0.005, Student’s t test) (Figure 1D) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed significant extramedullary hematopoiesis, as evidenced by increased numbers of cKit+Sca1+Lin− (KSL) HSPCs (Figures 1C and 1E).  To assess the longer-term effect of IDH2R140Q mutation, we analyzed mice following 7 months of continuous transgene induction. In addition to the changes observed at earlier time points, IDH2R140Q–t mice also had increased numbers of KSL cells in the bone marrow compared to controls (Figure 1C and 1F). Five out of ten mutants also displayed an expansion of the long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) compartment (CD48−CD150+ KSL), although overall this trend was not statistically significant (Figures 1C and 1G). To extend our findings we performed competitive bone marrow transplantation assays in which sorted KSL cells from IDH2R140Q–t and control mice (CD45.2+) were transplanted into sublethally irradiated recipients (CD45.1+). In this assay, IDH2R140Q–t HSPCs showed no difference in repopulation capacity compared to control HSPCs for at least 16 weeks after transplantation (Figures S1P–S1S).  IDH2R140Q Expression in HSPCs Drives a Block of Erythroid Differentiation in Vitro  Deregulated hematopoietic differentiation is frequently observed in AML and 2-HG has been shown to induce a partial block of differentiation in the erythroid leukemia cell line TF-1 (Losman et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). We therefore sought to investigate the effect of IDH2R140Q on differentiation of primary hematopoietic cells using a well-established methylcellulose differentiation assay. Following 8 weeks of transgene induction, we sorted KSL cells from IDH2R140Q–t and control mice and performed colony-forming unit (CFU) assays using semisolid medium with cytokines formulated to drive differentiation into the myeloid and erythroid lineages (MethoCult GF M3434). In the initial experiments, doxycycline was added to the medium to ensure continued transgene expression throughout the differentiation process. Strikingly, we observed a potent block of differentiation in IDH2R140Q–t HSPCs compared with controls (Figure 2A). Importantly, while the number of myeloid colonies (M, G/GM) was unaffected, the number of erythroid colonies was severely reduced (19.5 ± 1.3 in the controls versus 3.6 ± 0.9 in IDH2R140Q–t; p < 0.0001, Student’s t test). Notably, when cells from the first plating were collected and replated, IDH2R140Q–t cells formed more colonies in the second plating when compared with controls. IDH2R140Q–t cells could also be serially replated at least five times, whereas control cells no longer formed colonies after the third plating (Figure S2A).  Figure 2 Figure 2 IDH2R140Q–t Induces a Block of Erythroid Differentiation in KSL Cells That Is Reversible by Genetic Deinduction of the Transgene and by a Specific Inhibitor of Mutant IDH2 To determine if the block of differentiation induced by IDH2 mutation in our model can be reversed, we performed a series of experiments using both genetic and pharmacological inactivation of IDH2R140Q. First, we compared differentiation of IDH2R140Q–t and control KSL cells in the presence or absence of doxycycline. We sorted cells from mice following 8 weeks of in vivo transgene induction and then cultured them in CFU assays either with or without doxycycline. We confirmed that within 72 hr of doxycycline-free culture, transgene expression was efficiently silenced (Figure S2B). Excitingly, upon silencing IDH2R140Q, differentiation of mutant cells was restored to wild-type levels, demonstrating that continued expression of the mutant protein is required for the block of differentiation (Figure 2B).  Next we used a specific inhibitor of IDH2R140Q (AGI-6780) that has recently been shown to block production of 2-HG by the mutant protein (Wang et al., 2013). We confirmed that in our system 5 µM of the compound was able to reduce 2-HG production in mutant cells by ~75% (1.29 ± 0.29 mM in untreated cells versus 0.34 ± 0.04 mM in AGI-6780-treated cells; p < 0.05, Student’s t test) (Figure 2C). Similar to genetic deinduction, AGI-6780 completely reversed the block of differentiation in IDH2R140Q–t KSL cells (Figure 2D). AGI-6780 also reversed aberrant colony formation in the second and third plating (Figure S2C). Taken together our data demonstrate that mutant IDH proteins are sufficient to induce defects in the differentiation of primary hematopoietic cells. Critically, we have shown that these effects are reversible by pharmacological inhibition of 2-HG production by the mutant protein.  Mutant IDH proteins have been demonstrated to affect multiple biological pathways in a cell-context-dependent manner. We sought to explore the transcriptional signature that was associated with the block of erythroid differentiation and so we performed global gene expression microarray analysis. In order to identify genes that are responsible for the block of differentiation, rather than a consequence of it, we sorted KSL cells as previously, but cultured them in MethoCult GF M3434 for only 3 days prior to RNA extraction. At this stage, cells had undergone multiple rounds of division, but ~70% of cells retained an undifferentiated morphology (data not shown). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed a clear separation of control and IDH2R140Q–t samples (Figures 3A and S3A) and gene set enrichment analysis identified multiple pathways that were deregulated in mutant cells (Figure 3B). In particular, IDH2R140Q–t cells displayed reduced levels of transcripts activated by the transcription factor GATA1, a master regulator of erythroid differentiation (Fujiwara et al., 1996). Mutant cells also displayed activation of the hypoxia and TNF-α pathways. To validate our microarray findings and to determine whether the transcriptional signature induced by mutant IDH2 is reversible, we performed qRT-PCR analysis on a subset of genes that were identified as being altered and included control and IDH2R140Q–t samples that were treated with AGI-6780 (Figure 3C). For each of the transcripts examined, AGI-6780 at least partially reversed the changes induced by IDH2R140Q. This data further confirms our earlier findings that 2-HG-dependent effects are rapidly reversible. We also sorted megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) from control and IDH2R140Q–t animals and found that Bcl6, identified in our in vitro analysis, was also consistently upregulated in MEPs in vivo (Figure S3B).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Identification of a Transcriptional Signature Associated with the IDH2R140Q-Induced Block of Differentiation Continued Expression of IDH2R140Q Is Essential for Maintenance of HoxA9/Meis1a–Transformed Leukemic Cells  IDH mutations have been implicated in cancer but their ability to contribute to the maintenance of established disease in vivo has not been demonstrated. IDH2R140Q–t mice followed for 1 year of continuous doxycycline treatment did not develop leukemia, suggesting that additional genetic events are required for cancer development. This prompted us to investigate a well-established surrogate model of AML using retroviral overexpression of the homeobox proteins HoxA9 and Meis1a (Kroon et al., 1998). KSL cells isolated from IDH2R140Q+/+;ROSA26-M2+/− (hereafter referred to as IDH2R140Qhm-t) that had been treated with doxycycline were transduced with retroviruses encoding HoxA9 (MSCV-HoxA9-GFP) and Meis1a (MSCV-Meis1a–YFP) and transplanted into syngeneic sublethally irradiated recipients (Figure 4A). Following 7 weeks of administering continued doxycycline treatment, we observed an expansion of GFP/ YFP+ cells in the peripheral blood of primary recipients (not shown), indicating the establishment of an early leukemic or preleukemic state. These animals were then euthanized, GFP/ YFP+ bone marrow cells were sorted (Figure S4A), and 105 cells were retransplanted into secondary syngeneic recipients. After an initial 3 day period of administering doxycycline treatment to allow engraftment, we performed randomized deinduction with some of the recipients being taken off doxycycline food and thereby experiencing genetic inactivation of IDH2R140Q (Figure 4A).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Continued Expression of IDH2R140Q Is Required for Proliferation and/or Maintenance of HoxA9/Meis1a–Transformed Leukemic Cells After 8 weeks, all (5/5) doxycycline-treated secondary recipients developed AML, with their bone marrow being composed almost exclusively of GFP/YFP+Mac1+ and GFP/YFP+Mac1 + cKit+ cells (Figure 4B, 4C, and S4B). All five recipients showed virtually identical disease development (Figure S4B), strongly suggesting that additional stochastic events that may influence the proliferative or immuno-phenotypic properties of the cells had not occurred after transplantation. We confirmed overexpression of HoxA9 and Meis1a in doxycycline-treated recipients using qRT-PCR (Figure S4D). Strikingly, all (3/3) secondary recipients that had been withdrawn from doxycycline had no clearly discernible GFP/YFP+ population and normal ratios of myeloid and lymphoid cells, demonstrating that the vast majority of leukemic blasts had been eliminated (Figure 4B, 4C, and S4B).  To determine if a small number of leukemia-initiating cells that was not detectable by FACS remained and could act as a source of disease relapse, we used a PCR assay to detect MSCV-HoxA9-GFP and MSCV-Meis1a–YFP with primers designed to span introns so as not to amplify endogenous HoxA9 and Meis1a from genomic DNA. Using this assay and following an extended cycling protocol, we could not detect a reservoir of transduced cells in the bone marrow of recipients that had been withdrawn from doxycycline (Figure 4D). These data strongly suggest that all, or at least the vast majority, of leukemic cells, including the leukemia-initiating cell population, were eliminated upon genetic deactivation of IDH2R140Q.  Next, we aimed to characterize the kinetics of disease regression upon IDH2R140Q deinduction. As before, sublethally irradiated C57BL/6 recipients were transplanted with 105 GFP/YFP+ cells sorted from a preleukemic IDH2R140Qhm-t/HoxA9/Meis1a primary donor. This time, however, all secondary recipients were treated with doxycycline for 14 days, at which point two recipients were sacrificed and FACS analysis revealed that their bone marrow comprised ~50% GFP/YFP+ cells (Figure 4E). We then performed randomized deinduction and sacrificed recipients for analysis every 2 weeks. Consistent with what has recently been reported in vitro upon pharmacological inhibition of IDH2R140Q in human and mouse AML cells (Chen et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013), animals withdrawn from doxycycline treatment initially showed a hyperproliferation of GFP/YFP+ leukemic cells (Figure 4E; 4 week time point, 2 weeks off doxycycline food), followed by a reduction and elimination. In total, six of eight animals across the two independent experiments that had been withdrawn from doxycycline treatment for at least 4 weeks showed elimination of leukemic cells from the bone marrow and restoration of normal hematopoiesis (Figure S4C).  FACS, morphological, and transcriptional analyses of bone marrow at the 4 week time point suggested that upon IDH2R140Q deinduction, leukemic cells underwent differentiation. Despite having almost twice as many GFP/YFP+ cells in the bone marrow at this time point, recipients that had been withdrawn from doxycycline treatment had similar numbers of blasts to doxycycline-treated recipients (Figure 4F), implying a greatly increased ratio of morphologically differentiated to undifferentiated cells within the GFP/YFP+ fraction. Similarly, analysis of the stem/progenitor marker cKit showed a reduced ratio of cKit+ to cKit− cells upon deinduction (Figure S4E). Finally, we explored a panel of transcripts identified in our microarray analysis, and found that a subset of genes (Atf3, Ptgs2, and S100A9) that were upregulated in IDH2R140Q–t KSL cells undergoing differentiation in vitro were downregulated upon transgene deinduction in vivo in leukemic cells (Figure S4F). Taken together, our data demonstrate that HSPCs, which initially acquire an IDH2 mutation and subsequently become transformed by additional genetic events, at least in some contexts, are addicted to the continued function of the mutant IDH2 protein for maintenance.  Genetic Deinduction of IDH2R140Q Has Profound Effects on Leukemic Blasts in a Compound IDH2R140Q;Flt3ITD AML Model  We next sought to explore the function of mutant IDH2 in a system that more closely recapitulates the genetics of human AML. Internal tandem duplication in the receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3 is a frequent event in AML patients, is associated with poor prognosis, and co-occurs with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 (Patel et al., 2012). Knockin Flt3ITD transgenic mice develop lethal meyloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), but not overt leukemia (Chu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2008; Rau et al., 2013). Notably, combining the Flt3ITD allele with other mutations observed in AML patients can transform this MPN into full-blown acute leukemia (Rau et al., 2013).  To test whether the IDH2R140Q mutation can cooperate with Flt3ITD to drive disease progression, we generated compound IDH2R140Qt;Flt3ITD animals and treated them with doxycycline. Excitingly, and in contrast to Flt3ITD single transgenic littermate controls, compound animals developed acute leukemias (Figure 5A and 5B). In our cohort, IDH2R140Q–t;Flt3ITD animals displayed a significantly reduced overall survival compared with Flt3ITD controls (median survival of 229 days versus 352 days, respectively; p = 0.0299, Mantel-Cox test) (Figure S5A). Consistent with previous published observations (Chu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2008; Rau et al., 2013), the MPD in Flt3ITD animals was characterized by a hypercellular bone marrow with myeloid predominance and maturation (Figure 5A). The leukemias that developed in compound transgenic mice, on the other hand, were characterized by infiltration of large monomorphic blasts into hematopoietic (bone marrow, spleen, thymus) and non-hematopoietic (liver, lung, kidney) organs. We analyzed bone marrow cells, splenocytes, and thymocytes by FACS and found that the immuno-phenotype of cells from different animals, and occasionally from different organs within the same animal, varied (Figure 5B). We identified leukemias that displayed both myeloid (CD3ε−B220−Mac1lowcKit+) and lymphoid (Mac1− B220−CD3ε+CD8+CD4− and Mac1−B220−CD3ε−CD8+CD4+) markers (Figure 5B).  Figure 5 Figure 5 IDH2R140Q and Flt3ITD Cooperate in Leukemia Initiation Our data strongly suggest that IDH2R140Q is a bona fide cooperating oncogene in vivo. However, in order to further confirm the malignant nature of the disease and the diagnosis of acute leukemia that developed in IDH2R140Q–t;Flt3ITD animals, we performed transplantation experiments (Kogan et al., 2002). To this end, we transplanted leukemic cells into sublethally irradiated CD45.1+ syngeneic recipients and treated them with doxycycline. In this system, leukemic cells compete with normal recipient bone marrow cells in the niche and we were able to directly track their fate as they express the alternate surface antigen CD45.2. In two independent experiments we used BM MNCs or thymocytes derived from two different compound transgenic animals (#5517 and #12063, respectively). In both instances, the leukemic cells were able to recapitulate a lethal leukemia in transplanted recipients, and notably upon transplantation they mostly lost the expression of mature lineage markers (Mac1 for #5517 and CD3ε for #12063) (Figure 5C, 5D, and S5B–S5D). The disease derived from donor #5517 was used in serial transplantation experiments and became more aggressive and homogenous, and in secondary recipients the bone marrow was composed almost exclusively of CD45.2+ CD3ε−B220−Mac1− immature blasts.  Having established a model where mutant IDH2 contributes to leukemia initiation, our next step was to determine whether genetic inactivation of IDH2R140Q in this context had an effect on leukemia maintenance and/or progression. Due to the variable onset of disease and the time required to generate large cohorts of compound transgenic animals, we focused our efforts on a transplantation-based “chimeric” model. We used primary leukemia cells from the bone marrow of donor #5517 to perform randomized deinduction experiments. As previously, leukemic cells were allowed to engraft for 3 days in the presence of doxycycline, and then half of the recipients were taken off doxycycline food (Figure 6A). We followed animals until they became moribund and had to be euthanized. We observed no clear differences in survival of doxycycline-treated and -untreated animals across primary, secondary, or tertiary transplantation experiments. Analysis of serum 2-HG levels confirmed that the metabolite returned to baseline levels following transgene deinduction (Figure S5E). All animals that were caught prior to succumbing to disease were subjected to a detailed histopathological analysis. Infiltration of leukemic cells into non-hematopoietic organs was similar between the two treatment cohorts (Figure S5F). In contrast, there was a clear difference with respect to bone marrow involvement. The bone marrow of animals treated with doxycycline was composed predominantly of blasts whereas animals in the untreated group displayed fewer blasts and marked differentiation (Figures 6B–6E). The morphological analysis was in agreement with the percentage chimerism as assessed by CD45.1/CD45.2 staining. Thus, inhibition of IDH2R140Q in acute leukemia in the context of a cooperating Flt3ITD mutation, at least in some cases, results in reduced proliferation and/or differentiation of leukemic blasts.  Figure 6 Figure 6 Mutant IDH2 Contributes to Leukemia Initiation and Maintenance in the Context of a Cooperating Flt3ITD Lesion Go to: DISCUSSION IDH mutations have been proposed as attractive targets for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics because specific small molecule inhibitors can directly block the neomorphic activity of the enzymes, namely the production of 2-HG (Popovici-Muller et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). However, the contribution of mutant IDH proteins to transformation in vivo remains poorly understood, and importantly, whether or not cancer cells are addicted to 2-HG in their native niche for growth and/or maintenance is yet to be determined.  We have generated a mouse model of IDH2R140Q, the most common IDH2 mutation observed in human AML. To our knowledge this is the first transgenic allele of mutant IDH2 reported to date. In our model, expression of the transgene and the consequent production of 2-HG is on/off inducible and comparable to that observed in AML patients, providing a valuable system for evaluating the biological effects of deinduction as well as the pharmacological efficacy of potential 2-HG inhibitors. Consistent with what was previously reported for a knockin model of IDH1R132H (Sasaki et al., 2012), we found that expression of mutant IDH2 resulted in alterations within the hematopoietic compartment characterized by an expansion of HSPCs within the spleen and bone marrow, but on its own it was not sufficient for leukemogenesis, at least within the time frame of our experiment.  In a well-established multilineage differentiation assay, IDH2R140Q–t KSL cells formed a greatly reduced number of erythroid colonies, but an equivalent number of myeloid colonies, in comparison with controls. We established a transcriptional signature associated with this block of erythroid differentiation and identified downregulation of GATA1 activity and upregulation of the hypoxia and TNF-α pathways as being potentially important in this process. Inhibition of GATA1 function was previously reported in mutant IDH AML patients (Figueroa et al., 2010). The effects of mutant IDH proteins on the hypoxia pathway have been disputed with some studies reporting hyper-activation (Xu et al., 2011) and others reporting inactivation (Koivunen et al., 2012; Losman et al., 2013), albeit in different systems. In our model, the observed transcriptional changes strongly argue in favor of activation of hypoxic signaling. Importantly, both the block of differentiation and the altered transcriptional profile in IDH2R140Q–t cells is reversible by the mutant IDH2 inhibitor AGI-6780. Our results confirm and expand on previous studies showing that mutant IDH proteins can induce a reversible block of differentiation in the erythroid leukemia line TF-1 (Losman et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). We conclude that at least under some conditions, production of 2-HG by mutant IDH proteins may not only block differentiation of hematopoietic cells, it may in fact bias it toward the myeloid lineage.  Though studies on the effects of IDH mutations on primary and leukemic cells in vitro or on HSPC function and lineage development in vivo provide important mechanistic insights, they fail to answer the most crucial question of whether mutant IDH2 is required for leukemia initiation and maintenance in vivo in the presence of a functional niche. To address this, we used two compound transgenic models in which IDH mutation was combined with activation of additional oncogenes. HoxA9 and Meis1a are downstream targets of numerous pathways deregulated in AML and forced coexpression of these two proteins is sufficient to transform murine HSPCs (Kroon et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2010). Notably, when this powerful combination was introduced into IDH2 mutant KSL cells, the proliferation and/or maintenance of the resultant leukemic cells were dependent on continued expression of IDH2R140Q. Within 2 weeks of genetic deinduction of mutant IDH, we observed evidence of differentiation, and 2 weeks later, 6/8 animals showed complete remission with elimination of any detectable leukemic cells. Interestingly, we found that Atf3, which has been implicated as a positive regulator of TGF-β signaling and was shown to enhance cancer-initiating cell activity in breast cancer cells, was downregulated upon IDH2R140Q inactivation (Yin et al., 2010). Our results are both surprising and encouraging in that we have modeled a situation where IDH mutation occurs as an early event and leukemic transformation occurs as a result of subsequent genetic “hits.” Indeed, IDH mutation is considered an early event in the evolution of AML as well as other cancer types including glioma (Kandoth et al., 2013; Watanabe et al., 2009). Thus our results strongly suggest that IDH mutation may establish a state of oncogene addiction even in a genetic setting where mutant IDH is not required for cancer initiation.  By generating compound IDH2R140Q;Flt3ITD transgenic mutants, we demonstrated that IDH2R140Q cooperates with Flt3ITD in leukemia initiation in vivo, strongly suggesting that IDH mutations are cooperative tumorigenic drivers in AML. Our results are coherent with two recent studies demonstrating that retroviral transduction of IDH mutations into mouse bone marrow cells can cooperate with other oncogenic stimuli in leukemogenesis (Chaturvedi et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013). Retroviral models, though highly useful, are limited by numerous factors including artificial levels of transgene expression and random integration of the provirus into the genome. Our transgenic approach demonstrates the additional requirements and consequences of mutant IDH expression at physiologically relevant levels, as well as those of mutant IDH deinduction in vivo. Indeed the latency of disease development in IDH2R140Q;Flt3ITD mice suggests that additional mutations were required for full leukemic transformation. Recent sequencing efforts by the Cancer Genome Atlas have revealed that the median number of recurrent mutations in adult normal karyotype AML is approximately five (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013). The spectrum of disease that developed in different transgenic animals in our model may be explained by the nature of additional mutations or by the type of cell in which they occurred. Indeed, numerous transgenic models develop different types of hematopoietic malignancies among animals of the same genotype (Rau et al., 2013; Yilmaz et al., 2006).  As with our HoxA9/Meis1a transduction model, we observed that genetic inactivation of mutant IDH2 in the context of a cooperating Flt3ITD lesion had an effect on disease progression, and though we were unable to show increased survival upon mutant IDH2 deinduction, we did demonstrate effects on the proliferation and/or differentiation of leukemic blasts. Analysis of leukemic infiltrates suggested that in this highly aggressive setting, mice that display a response in the bone marrow may nonetheless succumb to the disease due to damage of nonhematopoietic organs. Additionally, because a reduction in 2-HG levels may take some time (based on our measurements in nonleukemic mice 2 weeks after deinduction), leukemic cells may cause irreparable damage to the bone marrow niche and/or to other organs before the cells are eliminated. If that is the case, inhibition of mutant IDH proteins may synergize with chemotherapy or other drugs (in this case Flt3 inhibitors) that produce more immediate effects.  In summary, our findings, and those of other groups (Losman et al., 2013; Rohle et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013), prove that at least some of the effects of IDH mutation are dependent on continued production of 2-HG. Critically, we extend previous work by demonstrating that those effects are reversible in vivo and addicted to the proto-oncogenic activity of the IDH mutant enzyme even in a genetic milieu where leukemia initiation is IDH mutant independent. We therefore validate mutant IDH proteins as very strong candidates for continued development of targeted anticancer therapeutics. Our model can serve as an invaluable tool for evaluating the biological effects of genetic deinduction of IDH mutations in various genetic settings as well as the pharmacological efficacy of potential mutant IDH2 inhibitors either alone or in combination with other compounds (Figure 6F).  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Transgenic Animals  The tetracycline-inducible IDH2R140Q allele was created following the scheme shown in Figure 1A and backcrossed into the C57BL/6 background (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more information). ROSA26-M2 (Hochedlinger et al., 2005), C57BL/6, and CD45.1+ (B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/ BoyJ) animals were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Flt3ITD transgenic (Li et al., 2008) animals were kindly provided by Donald Small and Patrick Brown from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Baltimore). To activate transgene expression in vivo, a doxycycline-containing chow (Harlan Laboratories) was administered to animals at the time of weaning (~3 weeks of age). To deactivate transgene expression, mice were taken off the doxycycline-containing diet and placed on a regular laboratory rodent diet. We obtained approval for all animal experiments from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center IACUC Committee on Animal Research (Protocol #066–2011; Approved 08/15/2011).  CFU-GEMM Assays  CFU-GEMM assays were performed using MethoCult GF M3434 (StemCell Technologies) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, KSL cells from control and IDH2R140Q–t mice were isolated by FACS using a BD FACSAria IIu sorter (Becton Dickinson) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and 900 cells were added to individual 3 ml aliquots of MethoCult GF M3434. One microgram per milliliter doxycycline and five micromolar AGI-6780 (Wang et al., 2013) were added as indicated. Cells were then plated at a density of 300 cells/dish in duplicate for each biological replicate and cultured for 7 days at 37°C and 5% CO2. Colonies were scored in a 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm area in the center of each dish using a grid. For the replating experiment, cells were collected in IMDM media supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), washed once in PBS, counted, and replated in MethoCult GF M3434 supplemented with 1 µg/ml doxycycline at a density of 5,000 cells/dish. Colonies were counted after 7–14 days of culture as above.  Generation of the HoxA9/Meis1 a Transduction Model  KSL cells were sorted (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) from IDH2R140Qhm-t mice that had been treated with doxycycline for 6 weeks. Cells were cultured for 8 hr in StemSpan serum free expansion medium (StemCell Technologies) supplemented with murine SCF, TPO, IL-3, IL-6, and Flt3-L (PeproTech) on Retronectin-coated (Takara Bio) petri dishes. Cells were transduced overnight using MSCV-HoxA9-GFP and MSCV-Meis1a–YFP (kindly provided by Dr. Christian Bach). The next day, cells were harvested and washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Viable cells were counted following trypan blue staining and 5,000 cells were injected retro-orbitally into sublethally irradiated (6.5Gr) C57BL/6 recipients. For the initial experiment, secondary transplantation and randomized deinduction was performed as outlined in Figure 4A. For the repeat experiment, all recipients were maintained on doxycycline food for 2 weeks, at which time 2 recipients were analyzed to confirm presence of GFP/YFP+ cells in the bone marrow. Randomized deinduction was then performed with recipients randomly assigned to doxycycline-treated or untreated groups. Mice were then analyzed every 2 weeks to monitor the kinetics of disease regression.  Serial Transplantation of IDH2R140Q–t/Flt3ITD Leukemic Cells  Bone marrow cells extracted from the femurs and tibias of a compound transgenic animal diagnosed with AML were subjected to red blood cell (RBC) lysis using ACK lysis buffer (GIBCO), washed twice with PBS supplemented with 2% FBS, passed through a 70 µM strainer, and frozen in FBS supplemented with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). On the day of transplantation, cells were thawed at 37°C and washed twice in PBS. Viable cells were counted following trypan blue staining. A hundred thousand donor cells were injected retro-orbitally into sublethally irradiated (6.5Gr) CD45.1+ recipients. Alternatively, 105 donor cells were mixed with 5 × 105 wild-type CD45.1 + competitor cells and injected retro-orbitally into lethally irradiated (9.5Gr) CD45.1+ recipients. For serial transplantations, the process was repeated using 105 cells from primary or secondary doxycycline-treated recipients.  Microarray Analysis  KSL cells from control and IDH2R140Q–t mice were cultured for 3 days in MethoCult GF M3434 (StemCell Technologies) supplemented with 1 µg/ml doxycycline. All cells were then collected and total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Ambion) with GlycoBlue (Life Technologies) as a carrier. Two-hundred nanograms of RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.1 ST arrays by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Genomics and Proteomics Core. The obtained raw intensity .cel files were normalized by robust multichip analysis (Bioconductor release 2.12) and differential expression was determined using the limma Bioconductor package by fitting a linear model. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted with the gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MolSigDB v3.1) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Table S4 for more information).  Heterozygous somatic mutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 and -2 (IDH1 and IDH2) were recently discovered in human neoplastic disorders. These mutations disable the enzymes’ normal ability to convert isocitrate to 2-ketoglutarate (2-KG) and confer on the enzymes a new function: the ability to convert 2-KG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG). We have detected heterozygous germline mutations in IDH2 that alter enzyme residue Arg140 in 15 unrelated patients with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA), a rare neurometabolic disorder characterized by supraphysiological levels of D-2-HG. These findings provide additional impetus for investigating the role of D-2-HG in the pathophysiology of metabolic disease and cancer. Recent studies in human cancer genetics have led to a resurgence of interest in a group of metabolic enzymes called isocitrate dehydrogenases. A recurrent heterozygous somatic mutation in the gene encoding cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) is present in glioblastoma multiforme and alters residue Arg132 (R132) in the enzyme’s active site (1). This mutation disables the enzyme’s normal ability to convert isocitrate to 2-ketoglutarate (2-KG) and confers on it a new function: the ability to convert 2-KG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) (2). Heterozygous mutations that alter residues R140 and R172 of mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2), the latter corresponding to R132 of IDH1, have been detected in other tumor types, acute myeloid leukemia and gliomas. These mutations also lead to abnormal production of D-2-HG (3, 4).  This unusual pathophysiological mechanism prompted us to explore whether mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 are associated with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA) (Mendelian Inheritance in Man no. 600721). D-2-HGA is a rare inherited neurometabolic disorder with a wide clinical spectrum. Although some children with D-2-HGA are asymptomatic, others exhibit characteristics that can include developmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, cardiomyopathy, and dysmorphic features. All affected individuals have consistently increased D-2-HG levels in urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid (5). About 50% of patients with this disorder, denoted D-2-HGA type I, have autosomal recessive mutations in the gene D2HGDH encoding D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (6), but the genetic basis of the disease in the remaining patients is unknown (5).  We sequenced the open reading frames of IDH1 and IDH2 in 17 unrelated idiopathic D-2-HGA patients (i.e., normal D-2-HGDH enzyme activity or no mutations in D2HGDH and consistently increased D-2-HG levels in body fluids). No mutations were detected in IDH1. In 15 patients, germline mutations were detected in IDH2: the known heterozygous G-to-A substitution at position 419 (c.419G>A), resulting in the replacement of Arg140 with Gln140 (p.R140Q) (4), and a novel heterozygous C-to-G substitution at position 418 (c.418C>G), Arg140→Gly140 (p.R140G) (Fig. 1 and table S1). Although the D-2-HGDH enzyme functions normally in these patients, the active protein appears to lack the catalytic capacity to oxidize all D-2-HG formed by IDH2 containing the R140 mutation; we thus denote the disorder in these patients as D-2-HGA type II. The higher urinary excretion of D-2-HG in the type II patients compared with that of type I patients (Fig. 1) is best explained by hyperproduction of this metabolite. The involvement of mitochondrial IDH2 is also consistent with the finding that D-2-HG is derived from mitochondrial 2-KG (7).  In eight of nine sets of parents, the mutation could not be detected, indicating that the heterozygous mutation arose de novo and that D-2-HGA type II is an autosomal dominant trait. In one family, however, three subsequent affected pregnancies were diagnosed by increased D-2-HG levels in amniotic fluid, suggesting germline mosaicism in the mother who herself had normal urinary D-2-HG levels and showed somatic mosaicism in her blood (Fig. 1).    Download high-res image  Open in new tab  Download Powerpoint Fig. 1 Characteristics of patients with D-2-HGA types I and II. The living D-2-HGA type II patients (n = 6) range in age from 3 to 22 years. The age of death of the remaining patients (n = 9) ranged from a few months up to 14 years. To date, none of the patients has been diagnosed with cancer. Shown below the table are sequence chromatograms from patients 5 and 15 (table S1), who have heterozygous IDH2 mutations. Somatic mosaicism for the R140Q mutation was detected in DNA of the mother of patient 5, unlike the other sets of parents in whom the mutation was not detected.  The pathophysiological consequences of increased D-2-HG in both cancer and D-2-HGA remain to be determined. Dang et al. have hypothesized that D-2-HG is an “onco-metabolite” that contributes to the formation of gliomas (2). However, patients with malignant gliomas and anaplastic astrocytomas that harbor IDH1 or IDH2 mutations show improved survival in comparison to patients whose tumors lack these mutations (1, 4). The absence of cancer diagnoses in our D-2-HGA patient population (>85 patients) is also not consistent with the proposed role of D-2-HG as an onco-metabolite, although the 15 D-2-HGA type II patients are young, which may preclude firm conclusions about cancer susceptibility (Fig. 1 and table S1).  An increased incidence of brain tumors has been noted among patients with L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L-2-HGA) (8). L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG) is the stereoisomer of D-2-HG, but L-2-HGA is a distinct neurometabolic disease. In contrast to D-2-HGA, L-2-HGA is a leukodystrophy. L-2-HGA manifests in early childhood with slowly progressive neurological symptoms, including psychomotor retardation, cerebellar ataxia, variable macrocephaly, and epilepsy (9). The biochemical defect in L-2-HGA is caused by mutations in the L2HGDH gene, which encodes an enzyme that specifically degrades the L enantiomer of 2-HG (9).  Now that disease-associated mechanisms have been described for nearly all D-2-HGA patients, genetic counseling is expected to be enhanced. Our findings provide additional impetus for investigating the role of D-2-HG in the pathophysiology of inborn errors of metabolism and neoplastic disorders.  
1767||Monoallelic point mutations in cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and its mitochondrial homolog IDH2 can lead to elevated levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in multiple cancers. Here we report that cellular 2HG production from cytosolic IDH1 mutation is dependent on the activity of a retained wild-type IDH1 allele. In contrast, expression of mitochondrial IDH2 mutations led to robust 2HG production in a manner independent of wild-type mitochondrial IDH function. Among the recurrent IDH2 mutations at Arg-172 and Arg-140, IDH2 Arg-172 mutations consistently led to greater 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-140 mutations, and the degree of 2HG accumulation correlated with the ability of these mutations to block cellular differentiation. Cytosolic IDH1 Arg-132 mutations, although structurally analogous to mutations at mitochondrial IDH2 Arg-172, were only able to elevate intracellular 2HG to comparable levels when an equivalent level of wild-type IDH1 was co-expressed. Consistent with 2HG production from cytosolic IDH1 being limited by substrate production from wild-type IDH1, we observed 2HG levels to increase in cancer cells harboring an endogenous monoallelic IDH1 mutation when mitochondrial IDH flux was diverted to the cytosol. Finally, expression of an IDH1 construct engineered to localize to the mitochondria rather than the cytosol resulted in greater 2HG accumulation. These data demonstrate that allelic and subcellular compartment differences can regulate the potential for IDH mutations to produce 2HG in cells. The consequences of 2HG elevation are dose-dependent, and the non-equivalent 2HG accumulation resulting from IDH1 and IDH2 mutations may underlie their differential prognosis and prevalence in various cancers.  Keywords: Cancer Biology, Cell Metabolism, Leukemia, Mitochondria, Tumor Metabolism Go to: Introduction Monoallelic point mutations in cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)3 were first discovered in exon sequencing studies of glioma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (1–3). All of the reported mutations were missense and at a single residue in the active site, Arg-132. These mutations were initially hypothesized to promote tumorigenesis through loss-of-function for the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate, coupled with dominant-negative activity against the retained wild-type allele (4). However, subsequent work found a novel gain-of-function for Arg-132 mutations in IDH1, as well as for structurally analogous mutations at Arg-172 of IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. This shared neomorphic enzymatic activity is the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(−)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) (5–7). Metabolite screening of AML samples revealed that 2HG-producing mutations can also occur at the non-orthologous Arg-140 residue of mitochondrial IDH2 (7). Collectively, 2HG-producing IDH1 Arg-132, IDH2 Arg-172, and IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are now known to be present in a large fraction of glioma, AML, chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarinoma, and T-cell angioimmunoblastic lymphoma samples, as well as isolated cases of colorectal and prostate cancer (3, 8–13). Additional 2HG-producing IDH mutations beyond those at IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172/Arg-140 exist, but appear to be very rare and do not include rare IDH mutations reported in thyroid cancer and melanoma nor common IDH single nucleotide polymorphisms (14).  Through production of the oncometabolite 2HG, IDH mutations have been proposed to have numerous pro-tumorigenic effects, most notably the competitive inhibition of α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzymes that modify chromatin (15–19). These effects have been associated with a block in cell differentiation. Although Arg-132 mutations in cytosolic IDH1, the analogous Arg-172 mutations in mitochondrial IDH2, and the non-analogous IDH2 Arg-140 mutations all demonstrate the ability to elevate 2HG oncometabolite levels, it is becoming increasingly clear that these mutations are not functionally equivalent. The best evidence to date for this concept may be found in AML, where a better prognosis for patients with IDH2 Arg-140 mutations versus those with IDH2 Arg-172 mutations or IDH1 Arg-132 mutations has been reported by multiple groups (20–22). IDH2 Arg-140 mutations have yet to be described in glioma, chondrosarcoma, or cholangiocarinoma, despite the established prevalence of both IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172 mutations in these cancers. In contrast, IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are the only IDH mutations found in the inborn error of metabolism d-2HG aciduria (23). The importance of subcellular localization differences between IDH1 and IDH2 proteins has also remained unexplored.  In this study, we have determined that there are distinct differences between the various 2HG-producing IDH1 and IDH2 mutations; both upstream regarding the metabolic pathways required to support 2HG production, and downstream regarding the cellular consequences of 2HG accumulation. The extent of 2HG production from mitochondrial IDH2 mutations depends on the particular site that is mutated. IDH2 Arg-140 mutations result in less cellular 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations under a variety of experimental conditions, correlating with the weaker ability of Arg-140 mutations to impair cell differentiation relative to Arg-172 mutations. Surprisingly, mutations in cytosolic IDH1 Arg-132, structurally analogous to mutations in mitochondrial IDH2 Arg-172, do not produce as much 2HG when overexpressed in cells at comparable levels. To a much greater extent than mitochondrial IDH2 mutations, cytosolic IDH1 mutations are substrate-limited for 2HG production in cells. Cellular 2HG accumulation from mutant IDH1 can be enhanced by co-expression of wild-type IDH1, diversion of wild-type IDH flux from mitochondria to cytosol, or forced re-localization of mutant IDH1 from cytosol to mitochondria. These results identify dose-dependent consequences of cellular 2HG accumulation and demonstrate that both allelic differences and the subcellular compartmentalization of metabolic flux can affect the ability of IDH mutations to result in cellular 2HG accumulation.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture and Reagents 293T cells, 3T3-L1 cells, JJ012 chondrosarcoma cells (24), and CS-1 chondrosarcoma cells (25) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (CellGro). JJ012 cells have a monoallelic endogenous IDH1 R132G mutation that has previously been reported (26), which we confirmed by Sequenom assay. CS-1 cells have a monoallelic endogenous IDH2 R172S mutation, which we determined by Sequenom assay. IDH mutation analysis in this cell line has not been previously reported. 3T3-L1 cells with stable expression of wild-type or mutant IDH2 were generated as described previously (17).  Cell Differentiation, Oil Red O Staining, Quantitative Real-time PCR 3T3-L1 cell differentiation, Oil Red O staining, and quantitative real-time PCR were performed as previously described (17). Experiments on primary murine bone marrow were performed according to previously published methods (16).  Protein Harvest and Quantitation and Western Blot Cells were lysed 48 h following transfection with RIPA buffer or mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 2 and 3 (Sigma). Lysates were sonicated with 2 × 30-s pulses using the high setting on a Bioruptor300 (Diagenode) and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were subsequently collected and assessed for protein concentration with BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). α-Ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption assays from cell lysates were performed as previously described (7). For cellular fractionation experiments, cells were lysed in isotonic buffer containing 200 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were homogenized with 60 strikes in a Dounce homogenizer and then centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. This supernatant was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet from this centrifugation was resuspended in RIPA buffer + protease inhibitor mixture and used as the heavy membrane fraction, whereas the supernatant layer was collected as the non-heavy membrane fraction. For Western blotting, lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE on Novex 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. Primary antibodies used were: anti-IDH1 (Santa Cruz sc-49996, 1:200 dilution), anti-IDH2 (Abcam ab55271, 1:500), anti-IDH3A (Abcam ab58641, 1:750), anti-ACO2 (Cell Signaling 6922, 1:1,000), anti-FLAG (Sigma F1804, 1:250), anti-Myc tag (Millipore 05–419, 1:1,000), anti-VDAC (Cell Signaling 4661S, 1:2,000), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma T6199, 1:10,000), and anti-S6 (Cell Signaling 2317 or 2217, 1:1,000). Detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat antibodies (GE Healthcare NA934V, GE Healthcare NA931V, and Santa Cruz sc-2020; all 1:10,000 dilution).  Metabolite Extraction Following gentle removal of culture medium from proliferating cells, cells were rapidly quenched with 80% methanol pre-chilled to −80 °C and containing a M+5 internal standard of R(−)-2HG containing five deuterium atoms (d-2-hydroxyglutaric-2,3,3,4,4-d5 acid; details for synthesis can be found in supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). Following incubation at −80 °C for at least 30 min, cell extracts were collected, sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated protein. Supernatants were next dried under nitrogen gas, redissolved in 1:1 acetonitrile: N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (Regis, Morton Grove, IL), and heated at 70 °C for 80 min to derivatize metabolites. t-Butyl dimethyl silyl derivatives of organic acids were then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as previously described (7, 27). 2HG levels were obtained by quantifying the peak area of the ion at m/z 433, formed through the loss of a t-butyl group (−57 atomic mass units) from the molecular ion tri-t-butyl dimethyl silyl-2HG, and normalizing to the peak area of the m/z 438 ion (representing the analogous derivative of the d5-2HG internal standard spiked at known concentration) and the total cellular protein as measured by BCA.  Plasmid Construction and Transfection The cDNA clone of human IDH1 (BC012846.1) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection, and human IDH2 (BC009244) from Invitrogen. IDH1 R132H, IDH2 R172K, and IDH2 R140Q point mutations were generated as previously described (17). FLAG or Myc tags were added to the C termini of the open reading frames by standard PCR techniques. To introduce siRNA resistance, silent point mutations were generated as follows by site-directed mutagenesis: for IDH1, the cDNA sequence 5′-gt cac tac cgc atg tac ca-3′ was changed to 5′-gt cat tat agg atg tat ca-3′ (alterations underlined) to confer resistance to the human IDH1 siRNA with sense sequence 5′-gu cac uac cgc aug uac ca-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs01_00340497). For IDH2, the cDNA sequence 5′-gt gat gag atg acc cgt at-3′ was changed to 5′-gc gac gaa aca agg at-3′ to confer resistance to the human IDH2 siRNA with sense sequence 5′-gu gau gag aug acc cgu au-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs01_00151612). These changes are not predicted to alter the sequence of the translated IDH1/2 proteins. To generate the IDH1 construct that localizes to mitochondria, the cDNA sequence encoding the predicted N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of IDH2 plus 10 subsequent amino acids was amplified using primers 5′-tgt caa ggt tta ttg aag tca aaa tgg ccg gct acc tgc ggg t-3′ and 5′-tct cct tgc atc tct acc acg ggc ttc gcc acc ttg atc c-3′. The resulting PCR product was purified and subsequently used as a “super primer” in a standard QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis reaction (28) using the IDH1 cDNA as template (with the underlined segments of the above listed primers providing the necessary complementarity to the IDH1 cDNA for the super primer). The mutagenesis reaction was then transformed into TOP10 cells (Invitrogen) and clones were identified that had incorporated the desired N-terminal MTS and subsequent 10 residues of IDH2 in place of the first 9 residues of IDH1. A similar N-terminal IDH domain swapping strategy has previously been shown to be effective with yeast IDH enzymes (29). Integrity of constructs was confirmed by direct sequencing prior to transfection into 293T cells in pCMV-Sport6 or pCDNA3 expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions.  siRNA For siRNA experiments in JJ012 and CS-1 cells, cells were reverse transfected with Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen) using 30 pmol of siRNA (final concentration of 10 nm) per 1.5 × 105 cells/well of 6-well plates. For plasmid and siRNA co-transfection experiments in 293T cells, forward transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 using 50–60 pmol of siRNA (final concentration of 25–30 nm) per 7–8 × 105 cells/well of 6-well plates. In addition to the IDH1 and IDH2 siRNAs described above, additional siRNAs used were: universal negative control from Sigma-Proligo (SIC001), IDH1 5′-cugucuaaggguuggccuu-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs01_00023490), IDH2 5′-caagucuucggguggcuuu-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs02_00333382), IDH3A 5′-caggcaaggacauggcgaa-3′ from Sigma-Proligo (SASI_Hs02_00339757), ACO2 5′-cauccauuaugaccugcu-3′ and 5′-cauuaacauuguucgcaa-3′ from Ambion (Silencer Select 4390824, s921 and s922). All listed sequences are for the sense strand.  Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed with Student's t test. To analyze experiments comparing 2HG accumulation in pairs of transfectants over a range of IDH expression levels, a paired samples Student's t test was used.  Go to: RESULTS Extent of 2HG Production from Mitochondrial IDH2 Mutations Depends on the Affected Residue but Not on Wild-type IDH Activity Arg-172 mutations in mitochondrial IDH2 are found in glioma, chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and lymphoma, and are associated with a poor prognosis in AML. In contrast, Arg-140 mutations are not found in glioma, chondrosarcoma, and cholangiocarcinoma, and are associated with a better prognosis in AML. We hypothesized that these differences could be accounted for, in part, by quantitative differences in the extent of cellular 2HG accumulation resulting from Arg-140 versus Arg-172 mutations. To test this hypothesis, we compared the most common IDH2 mutations R140Q and R172K for their ability to produce 2HG at various levels of expression in cells lacking endogenous IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. Increasing expression of both mutants led to increasing amounts of 2HG (Fig. 1A). However, R172K mutant IDH2 expression consistently resulted in more 2HG accumulation than R140Q mutant expression (p < 0.005).  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Mitochondrial IDH2 Arg-140 mutations result in less cellular 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations, and 2HG accumulation from both mutations is insensitive to depletion of wild-type IDH. A, FLAG-tagged IDH2 R140Q and R172K cDNA constructs, or empty ... In most reported cases, both Arg-140 and Arg-172 mutations in IDH2 occur at only one allele, with retention of one wild-type IDH2 copy in tumors. Wild-type IDH2 can potentially produce both mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate and NADPH, the substrates for the neomorphic activity of mutant IDH2. To address whether differential dependence on wild-type IDH2 function could account for the differences in 2HG production we observed between Arg-140 and Arg-172 mutations, we expressed siRNA-resistant versions of the IDH2 R140Q and R172K mutants with or without simultaneous siRNA knockdown of the endogenous wild-type IDH2. The ability of both mutations to result in 2HG accumulation was insensitive to knockdown of the endogenous wild-type IDH2 (Fig. 1B). To address whether IDH3, which produces mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate and NADH, could compensate for the loss of wild-type IDH2, we expressed siRNA-resistant versions of IDH2 R140Q or R172K with simultaneous knockdown of either IDH3 alone or IDH3 together with endogenous wild-type IDH2 (Fig. 1C). Neither IDH3 knockdown alone nor the combined knockdown of endogenous wild-type IDH2 and IDH3 decreased cellular 2HG accumulation from IDH2 R140Q or R172K mutant expression. Directly upstream of the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate by wild-type mitochondrial IDH2 and IDH3 is the mitochondrial aconitase ACO2, which isomerizes mitochondrial citrate to isocitrate. In a chondrosarcoma cell line with a naturally occurring, endogenous, monoallelic IDH2 R172S mutation, we examined the effect of impairing the pathway of mitochondrial citrate to α-ketoglutarate conversion. As expected, siRNA against IDH2 in this cell line, targeting both the mutant and wild-type IDH2, resulted in a sharp decrease in 2HG accumulation from mutant IDH2. However, knockdown of ACO2 did not impair 2HG accumulation, providing further evidence that the ability to convert citrate to isocitrate and then α-ketoglutarate in the mitochondria is not critical for the production of 2HG by mitochondrial IDH2 mutations (Fig. 1D). siRNA knockdown of either IDH3 or IDH1 was also unable to markedly impair 2HG accumulation in these cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that IDH2 Arg-140 mutations consistently result in less 2HG accumulation in cells than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations, and that 2HG production by IDH2 mutations is unaffected by impaired production of α-ketoglutarate from mitochondrial citrate in multiple cell types.  Differential 2HG Production by IDH2 Arg-140 and Arg-172 Mutations Has Consequences for Gene Expression and Cell Differentiation Recent work has highlighted the ability of 2HG to inhibit multiple α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzymes and impair growth factor/cytokine-induced gene expression and the ability of cells to differentiate. Previously we have reported that stable expression of an R172K IDH2 mutant in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes can impair their ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes following exposure to a well established differentiation mixture and this effect can be mimicked by adding cell penetrant forms of 2HG to the medium (17). To extend this observation, 3T3-L1 cells expressing either the R140Q or R172K mutant of IDH2 were compared. Although IDH2 R140Q expressing 3T3-L1 cells were impaired in their ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes, the extent of differentiation blockade was consistently less than that observed with IDH2 R172K expressing cells (Fig. 2, A-C). IDH2 R140Q expressing cells showed a more modest block in the ability to accumulate intracellular lipid as assessed by Oil Red O staining, and also demonstrated less silencing of the expression of the fat cell differentiation genes Glut4, FABP4, Adiponectin, and PPARγ than IDH2 R172K expressing cells. These effects correlated with the R140Q expressing cells accumulating 2HG to ∼⅓ of the level found in the R172K expressing cells (Fig. 2D). These findings demonstrate that IDH2 Arg-140 mutations can result in less 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations in non-transformed cells, and suggest that dosage differences in 2HG accumulation can account for the different cellular effects of IDH2 Arg-140 versus Arg-172 mutations.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. Extent of 2HG accumulation correlates with the degree of differentiation blockade in non-transformed cells expressing IDH2 Arg-140 or Arg-172 mutations. A, Western blot of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes stably expressing additional IDH2 WT, IDH2 R172K, IDH2 R140Q, ... Although we have utilized 3T3-L1 cells as a general model system for cell differentiation, reflecting the occurrence of IDH mutations in a wide variety of cancers and in metabolic disorders, we have also specifically examined the differential effects of IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R172K in a hematopoietic cell model relevant to AML. We have previously reported that expression of IDH2 R140Q can increase the expression of the progenitor cell marker c-kit (stem cell factor receptor) in murine primary bone marrow cells (16). We report here an extension of this analysis to compare the relative abilities of IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R172K to increase c-kit expression. Following 5 days of liquid culture in myeloid growth conditions, a higher percentage of c-kit expressing cells was observed in bone marrow expressing IDH2 R172K than in bone marrow expressing IDH2 R140Q (supplemental Fig. S1). These data provide further evidence that IDH2 Arg-172 and Arg-140 mutations can result in distinct degrees of cell differentiation impairment.  2HG Production from Cytosolic IDH1 Mutation in Cells Is Dependent on Retained Wild-type IDH1 Expression With no exceptions reported to date, 2HG-producing mutations at Arg-132 of cytosolic IDH1 are monoallelic, with retention of the wild-type IDH1 allele. Arg-132 of cytosolic IDH1 is the analogous residue to Arg-172 of mitochondrial IDH2 (Fig. 3A). Both IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172 play similar roles for substrate stability in the enzyme active site. To directly compare the cellular 2HG accumulation of cytosolic IDH1 Arg-132 mutations versus mitochondrial IDH2 mutations, we expressed a FLAG-tagged version of the most common IDH1 mutation, R132H, as well as both IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R172K. Surprisingly, IDH1 R132H expression did not result in as much 2HG accumulation as expression of IDH2 R172K (Fig. 3B). The inability of IDH1 R132H expression to result in as much 2HG accumulation as IDH2 R172K expression was observed across a range in mutant IDH expression (Fig. 3C). However, when additional wild-type IDH1 was co-overexpressed, 2HG accumulation was reproducibly increased in cells expressing various levels of R132H mutant IDH1 (p < 0.05). With simultaneous transfection of exogenous wild-type and mutant IDH1, predicted to maximize the formation of wild-type:mutant IDH1 heterodimers, cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 demonstrated comparable 2HG accumulation to cells expressing IDH2 R172K, and both IDH1 R132H and IDH2 R172K cells had greater 2HG levels than cells expressing IDH2 R140Q (Fig. 3C). The ability of co-overexpression of wild-type IDH1 to enhance cellular 2HG production from the R132H mutant IDH1 was also observed with untagged constructs, as well as different combinations of FLAG and Myc-tagged versions of IDH1 (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). However, co-transfection of an IDH1 A134D mutant previously reported to be catalytically inactive (14) did not result in comparable augmentation of 2HG accumulation in IDH1 R132H-transfected cells (supplemental Fig. S2C).  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Cellular 2HG accumulation from cytosolic IDH1 mutation depends on maintained expression of wild-type IDH1. A, depiction of the open reading frames of the homologous proteins cytosolic IDH1 and mitochondrial IDH2. Recurrently mutated amino acid residues ... To examine if depletion of endogenous wild-type IDH1 could impair 2HG production from mutant IDH1, we constructed a tagged version of IDH1 R132H engineered to be siRNA resistant, and co-transfected it along with siRNA against endogenous wild-type IDH1 (siIDH1). Although we reproducibly observed ∼2-fold higher expression of Myc-tagged IDH1 R132H when endogenous wild-type IDH1 levels were decreased, 2HG accumulation did not double but instead decreased by 50% (Fig. 3D). To confirm that this reduction in 2HG accumulation was due to the depletion of wild-type IDH1 and not an off-target siRNA effect, we co-transfected FLAG-tagged IDH1 WT that was also engineered to be siRNA resistant along with the siRNA-resistant Myc-tagged IDH1 R132H. With co-expression of IDH1 WT-FLAG along with IDH1 R132H-Myc, there was a 3-fold increase in 2HG production that was not diminished by endogenous wild-type IDH1 depletion with siIDH1 transfection. Cell proliferation was confirmed to be comparable under all of these transfection conditions (supplemental Fig. S2D). These results demonstrate that retention of wild-type IDH1 expression is critical for 2HG production from mutant IDH1 in the cytosol.  Impairing Mitochondrial IDH Flux Increases 2HG Production from Mutant IDH1 in the Cytosol To examine whether increasing substrate flux through the existing wild-type IDH1 can enhance the ability of mutant IDH1 to produce 2HG in the cytosol, we examined the effect of impairing mitochondrial IDH activity in JJ012 chondrosarcoma cells harboring a naturally occurring, endogenous, monoallelic IDH1 R132G mutation. Depleting mitochondrial IDH2 or IDH3 can result in the diversion of citrate and/or isocitrate to the cytosol thus increasing substrate availability for wild-type IDH1 (Fig. 4A). As expected, transfection of siRNA targeting both wild-type and mutant IDH1 (siIDH1) impaired the ability of these cells to accumulate 2HG (Fig. 4B). However, depletion of either mitochondrial IDH2 or IDH3 increased 2HG accumulation in these cells harboring a monoallelic IDH1 mutation. Depletion of mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2) with two independent siRNAs also led to a reproducible increase in 2HG accumulation. These results provide further evidence that the ability of mutant IDH1 to produce 2HG is limited by the local supply of substrate, which can be increased by enhancing the isocitrate → α-ketoglutarate flux and cytosolic NADPH production through wild-type IDH1.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. Impairing mitochondrial IDH flux results in increased 2HG accumulation in cells with endogenous cytosolic IDH1 mutation. A, model for metabolism in a cell harboring a monoallelic IDH1 mutation. B, JJ012 chondrosarcoma cells with a naturally occurring, ... Mitochondrial Localization of Cytosolic IDH1 Mutation Results in Greater 2HG Accumulation Collectively, the above results suggest that cytosolic IDH1 mutants are more limited in their supply of substrate for 2HG production than mitochondrial IDH2 mutants. To confirm that the differing substrate supply dependence between IDH1 and IDH2 mutants in cells is due to their subcellular localization differences, we generated an IDH1 construct that incorporated the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of IDH2 (Fig. 5A). We confirmed that this “mito-IDH1” construct localized to the cellular heavy membrane fraction containing mitochondria, like mitochondrial IDH2 and unlike cytosolic IDH1 lacking the MTS (Fig. 5B). The tagged versions of IDH1 R132H and mito-IDH R132H were then transfected over a 40-fold range. We determined that cell lysates with equivalent expression levels of the mitochondrial and cytosolic localized IDH1 R132H proteins demonstrated equivalent α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption rates when α-ketoglutarate and NAPH were provided in excess in vitro following cell lysis (data not shown). However, when assessing 2HG accumulation in cells with a range of expression levels of cytosolic IDH1 R132H or mito-IDH1 R132H, mito-IDH1 R132H-expressing cells consistently demonstrated greater 2HG accumulation than cells expressing comparable levels of cytosolic IDH1 R132H (p < 0.01, Fig. 5C). We performed another experiment to assess 2HG accumulation in cells expressing IDH1 R132H in the cytosol or mitochondria relative to cells expressing IDH2 R172K with its normal mitochondrial localization sequence intact. At comparable expression levels, both IDH2 R172K and mito-IDH1 R132H expressing cells had greater 2HG accumulation than cells expressing IDH1 R132H localized to the cytosol (Fig. 5D). Collectively, these data demonstrate that localization of IDH mutants to mitochondria rather than the cytosol results in greater 2HG accumulation in cells.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Mitochondrial localization of cytosolic IDH1 mutant results in greater accumulation of 2HG in cells. A, An IDH1 construct designed to mislocalize to the mitochondria was engineered by placing the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of IDH2 at the N ... Go to: DISCUSSION The common feature of recurrent cancer-associated mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes is a neomorphic enzymatic activity converting α-ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite 2HG. In many functional studies to date, the various 2HG-producing IDH1/2 mutations have been considered equivalent. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that distinct neomorphic IDH1/2 alleles are not found with equal frequencies across different cancers and are not associated with the same prognosis (supplemental Table S1). For example, IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are rarely found in cancer outside of myeloid malignancies. But within myeloid malignancies, IDH2 Arg-140 is the most commonly mutated IDH residue in AML, and is uniquely associated with a better AML prognosis relative to IDH2 Arg-172 and IDH1 Arg-132 mutations (20–22). Moreover, little work has addressed the importance of differential subcellular localization of the IDH1 and IDH2 proteins.  The data presented here demonstrate that the particular residue that is mutated within the IDH active site has consequences for both the amount of 2HG that accumulates and the cellular consequences of IDH mutation. Both Arg-140 and Arg-172 mutations in mitochondrial IDH2 can produce increasing amounts of 2HG at increasing cellular expression levels, and both are insensitive to impairment of wild-type IDH activity. However, across multiple expression conditions and cell types, IDH2 Arg-140 mutations consistently result in less 2HG accumulation than IDH2 Arg-172 mutations. A recent report documenting similar differences when these mutations were knocked-in to an endogenous IDH2 allele in colon cancer cells via homologous recombination provides further support for this finding (30). Here, we demonstrate that the quantitative difference in 2HG accumulation between IDH2 Arg-140 and Arg-172 mutations is within a range that can variably alter gene expression in non-transformed cells and the ability of these lineage-specific progenitor cells to differentiate into terminally differentiated cells. In addition to cancer, these data are relevant to the inborn error of metabolism d-2HG aciduria. In this disease marked by widespread 2HG elevation in cells and body fluids, nearly 50% of cases harbor IDH2 Arg-140 mutations, but other IDH mutations are not found. We propose that only the lower 2HG levels resulting from IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are compatible with embryogenesis and that higher 2HG levels resulting from other germline IDH mutations may be lethal in utero.  It remains possible that the major downstream effects of 2HG that are critical to transformation vary between different cancers. 2HG can inhibit the catalytic activity of TET2, a DNA 5-methylcytosine hydroxylase. In AML, the mutual exclusivity of IDH mutations with TET2 mutations (16), as well as the emerging phenotypes of TET2 knock-out mice (31–33), provides evidence that inhibition of TET2 function can be a critical event sufficient to promote hematologic malignancy. In contrast, other cancers like glioma harbor IDH mutations but not TET2 mutations. We have proposed that in glioma, concerted inhibition of Jumonji histone demethylases by 2HG may assume an important tumorigenic role that cannot be recapitulated by simply inhibiting TET2 (17). 2HG can also inhibit prolyl hydroxylases that modify collagen (19, 34), which are likely to be of more importance in solid tumors such as glioma and chondrosarcoma than in liquid tumors like AML. Sustained inhibition of histone demethylases and/or collagen modifying enzymes may require higher levels of 2HG than that required for effective inhibition of TET2 function in myeloid cells. This requirement may account for why the lower 2HG-producing IDH2 Arg-140 mutations are not found in solid tumors. Further studies, including those with genetically engineered mice expressing the various IDH mutations in different cell lineages, will be required to test this hypothesis.  Left unexplored in the literature to date is examination of the impact that differential subcellular localization of IDH1 and IDH2 mutant proteins has on the ability of these mutants to result in 2HG accumulation in cells. IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172 are structurally analogous residues and play similar roles in substrate binding in the enzyme active site, yet expression of IDH1 Arg-132 and IDH2 Arg-172 mutations in cells at comparable levels did not result in equivalent levels of 2HG accumulation unless wild-type IDH1 was co-expressed. This result is unlikely to be due solely to intrinsically weaker enzymatic activity of IDH1 R132H relative to IDH2 R172K for producing 2HG, because mitochondrial targeting of IDH1 R132H also resulted in increased 2HG accumulation relative to IDH1 R132H in the cytosol. The results presented here suggest that unlike the case with mitochondrial IDH2 mutations, 2HG production from cytosolic IDH1 mutations is particularly dependent on metabolic flux through a wild-type IDH1 partner to increase the local availability of substrate.  Although both mitochondrial IDH2 and cytosolic IDH1 mutations predominantly occur in monoallelic fashion, cases with reduction to homozygosity of mutant IDH2 have been reported (26, 35), whereas loss of the wild-type IDH1 allele in an IDH1 mutant cancer has not been described to date. We have previously proposed that more efficient generation of 2HG with co-expression of WT and mutant IDH1 may exist (5). One possible explanation for this, that the WT:R132H heterodimer could have intrinsically better activity to directly reduce α-ketoglutarate to 2HG, is not supported by the recent data of Leonardi et al. (36) who shows that the recombinant WT:R132H heterodimer is not as efficient as the R132H:R132H homodimer at converting α-ketoglutarate to 2HG in vitro. Although Pietrak et al. (37) concluded that the potential for substrate channeling from isocitrate → α-ketoglutarate → 2HG through WT:R132H heterodimers is present, they also concluded that the WT subunit was not necessary for the production of 2HG by the mutant recombinant protein. This finding was arrived at when α-ketoglutarate and NADPH were supplied in excess in vitro. But particularly in light of other reports suggesting that 2HG in cells is directly produced from the pathway of glutamine → glutamate → α-ketoglutarate → 2HG (5, 38), it has remained unclear how retained expression of wild-type IDH1 could be important for 2HG production by mutant IDH1.  In contrast to these biochemical studies of purified proteins, the present data suggest that in intact cells, cytosolic mutant IDH1 is substrate limited and that wild-type IDH1 contributes to the local substrate production required for mutant IDH1 to produce 2HG. This finding adds to the growing evidence that IDH1 mutations do not act via dominant inhibition of wild-type IDH1. By contrast, our findings suggest that targeting the provision of substrate by wild-type IDH1 to mutant IDH1 may provide an additional mechanism to mitigate the ultimate effects of IDH mutations by reducing the ability to produce 2HG. This would be especially attractive if increased flux through wild-type IDH1 can be shown to be dependent on the activation of growth factor signaling pathways. Prior evidence has linked IDH1 expression levels to the activity of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein transcription factor (39). Increasing IDH1 expression has been suggested to alter cellular and organismal physiology by increasing the production of cytosolic NADPH (40). Further studies in non-transformed cell lines will be needed to test the dependence of 2HG production from cytosolic mutant IDH1 on the prior induction of growth factor signaling and increased wild-type IDH1 activity. But this hypothesis may partially explain the failure (to date) of genetically engineered mouse models to demonstrate the initiation of tumorigenesis by IDH1 mutation in a stem/progenitor cell (34, 41, 42). It appears from the present data that 2HG production from cytosolic mutant IDH1 is a dynamic process that is acutely sensitive to the background metabolic state of the cell.  In contrast to 2HG production from mutant IDH1 being dependent on wild-type IDH1, these data show that 2HG production from mutant IDH2 is not dependent on wild-type mitochondrial IDH2 (or IDH3) activity. This is consistent with the report that IDH2 mutants do not heterodimerize with IDH2 WT, unlike IDH1 R132H mutants that do heterodimerize with a wild-type partner (43). It remains a technical challenge in the field to reliably measure metabolite levels in the subcellular compartments of intact cells. Our study does not determine the percentages of α-ketoglutarate and NADPH within each subcellular compartment that are dependent on wild-type IDH activity and/or the metabolism of anaplerotic substrates like glutamine. However, the lack of dependence of 2HG production from mitochondrial IDH2 mutations on wild-type IDH activity is consistent with mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate levels being maintained by a variety of anaplerotic substrates, and with a high NADPH/NADP+ ratio being maintained in the mitochondria through the interconversion of NADH to NADPH by the mitochondrial trans-hydrogenase (44). Recent work from multiple groups has implicated wild-type IDH “reverse flux,” the NADPH-dependent reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate back to isocitrate, as playing an important role for cell growth and viability, particularly in hypoxic conditions or in cells with impaired TCA cycle function (27, 45–47). Although there is debate regarding whether this reductive carboxylation is primarily dependent upon cytosolic IDH1 or mitochondrial IDH2, the metabolic conditions that favor 2HG production from IDH mutations are also likely to favor reductive carboxylation flux from wild-type IDH proteins. The present results suggest that relative to the cytosol, mitochondria provide a more consistently favorable environment for the reductive metabolism of glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate.  The somatic mutations in cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) observed in gliomas can lead to the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Here, we report that tumor 2HG is elevated in a high percentage of patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Surprisingly, less than half of cases with elevated 2HG possessed IDH1 mutations. The remaining cases with elevated 2HG had mutations in IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. These data demonstrate that a shared feature of all cancer-associated IDH mutations is production of the onco-metabolite 2HG. Furthermore, AML patients with IDH mutations display a significantly reduced number of other well characterized AML-associated mutations and/or associated chromosomal abnormalities, potentially implicating IDH mutation in a distinct mechanism of AML pathogenesis.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Mutations in human cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase I (IDH1) occur somatically in >70% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas, and in 8.5% of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) (Mardis et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Mutations have also been reported in cancers of the colon and prostate (Kang et al., 2009; Sjoblom et al., 2006). To date, all reported IDH1 mutations result in an amino acid substitution at a single arginine residue in the enzyme’s active site, R132. A subset of intermediate grade gliomas lacking mutations in IDH1 have been found to harbor mutations in IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. The IDH2 mutations which have been identified in gliomas occur at the analogous residue to IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172. Both IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutants lack the wild-type enzyme’s ability to convert isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (Yan et al., 2009). To date, all reported IDH1 or IDH2 mutations are heterozygous, with the cancer cells retaining one wild-type copy of the relevant IDH1 or IDH2 allele. No patient has been reported with both an IDH1 and IDH2 mutation. These data argue against the IDH mutations resulting in a simple loss of function.  Normally both cytosolic IDH1 and mitochondrial IDH2 exist as homodimers within their respective cellular compartments, and the mutant proteins retain the ability to bind to their respective wild-type partner. Therefore, it has been proposed that mutant IDH1 can act as a dominant negative against wild-type IDH1 function, resulting in a decrease in cytosolic α-ketoglutarate levels and leading to an indirect activation of the HIF-1α pathway (Zhao et al., 2009). However, recent work has provided an alternative explanation. The R132H IDH1 mutation observed in gliomas was found to display a gain of function for the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) (Dang et al., 2009). This in vitro activity was confirmed when 2HG was found to be elevated in IDH1-mutated gliomas. Whether this neomorphic activity is a common feature shared by IDH2 mutations was not determined.  IDH1 R132 mutations identical to those reported to produce 2HG in gliomas were recently reported in AML (Mardis et al., 2009). These IDH1 R132 mutations were observed in 8.5% of AML patients studied, and a significantly higher percentage of mutation was observed in the subset of patients whose tumors lacked cytogenetic abnormalities. IDH2 R172 mutations were not observed in this study. However, during efforts to confirm and extend these findings, we found an IDH2 R172K mutation in an AML sample obtained from a 77 year old female. This finding confirmed that both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations can occur in AML and prompted us to more comprehensively investigate the role of IDH2 in AML.  The present study was undertaken to see if IDH2 mutations might share the same neomorphic activity as recently reported for glioma-associated IDH1 R132 mutations. We also determined whether tumor-associated 2HG elevation could prospectively identify AML patients with mutations in IDH. To investigate the lack of reduction to homozygosity for either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations in tumor samples, the ability of wild-type IDH1 and/or IDH2 to contribute to cell proliferation was examined.  Go to: RESULTS IDH2 is mutated in AML  A recent study employing a whole-genome sequencing strategy in an AML patient resulted in the identification of somatic IDH1 mutations in AML (Mardis et al., 2009). Based on the report that IDH2 mutations were also observed in the other major tumor type in which IDH1 mutations were implicated (Yan et al., 2009), we sequenced the IDH2 gene in a set of de-identified AML DNA samples. Several cases with IDH2 R172 mutations were identified. In the initial case, the IDH2 mutation found, R172K, was the same mutation reported in glioma samples. It has been recently reported that cancer-associated IDH1 R132 mutants display a loss-of-function for the use of isocitrate as substrate, with a concomitant gain-of-function for the reduction of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). This prompted us to determine if the recurrent R172K mutation in IDH2 observed in both gliomas and leukemias might also display the same neomorphic activity. In IDH1, the role of R132 in determining IDH1 enzymatic activity is consistent with the stabilizing charge interaction of its guanidinium moiety with the β-carboxyl group of isocitrate (Figure 1A). This β-carboxyl is critical for IDH’s ability to catalyze the interconversion of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate, with the overall reaction occurring in two steps through a β-carboxyl-containing intermediate (Ehrlich and Colman, 1976). Proceeding in the oxidative direction, this β-carboxyl remains on the substrate throughout the IDH reaction until the final decarboxylating step which produces α-ketoglutarate.  Figure 1 Figure 1 IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 are analogous residues that both interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 are analogous residues that both interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate  To understand how R172 mutations in IDH2 might relate to the R132 mutations in IDH1 characterized for gliomas, we modeled human IDH2 based on the pig IDH2 structure containing bound isocitrate (Ceccarelli et al., 2002). Human and pig IDH2 protein share over 97% identity and all active site residues are identical. The active site of human IDH2 was structurally aligned with human IDH1 (Figure 1). Similar to IDH1, in the active site of IDH2 the isocitrate substrate is stabilized by multiple charge interactions throughout the binding pocket. Moreover, like R132 in IDH1, the analogous R172 in IDH2 is predicted to interact strongly with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate. This raised the possibility that cancer-associated IDH2 mutations at R172 might affect enzymatic interconversion of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate similarly to IDH1 mutations at R132.  Mutation of IDH2 R172K enhances α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption  To test whether cancer-associated IDH2 R172K mutations shared the gain of function in α-ketoglutarate reduction observed for IDH1 R132 mutations (Dang et al., 2009), we overexpressed wild-type or R172K mutant IDH2 in cells with endogenous wild-type IDH2 expression, and then assessed isocitrate-dependent NADPH production and α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates. As reported previously (Yan et al., 2009), extracts from cells expressing the R172K mutant IDH2 did not display isocitrate-dependent NADPH production above the levels observed in extracts from vector-transfected cells. In contrast, extracts from cells expressing a comparable amount of wild-type IDH2 markedly increased isocitrate-dependent NADPH production (Figure 2A). However, when these same extracts were tested for NADPH consumption in the presence of α-ketoglutarate, R172K mutant IDH2 expression was found to correlate with a significant enhancement to α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption. Vector-transfected cell lysates did not demonstrate this activity (Figure 2B). Although not nearly to the same degree as with the mutant enzyme, wild-type IDH2 overexpression also reproducibly enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption under these conditions.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Expression of R172K mutant IDH2 results in enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent consumption of NADPH Mutation of IDH2 R172K results in elevated 2HG levels  R172K mutant IDH2 lacks the guanidinium moiety in residue 172 that normally stabilizes β-carboxyl addition in the interconversion of α-ketoglutarate and isocitrate. Yet R172K mutant IDH2 exhibited enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates (Figure 2B). A similar enhancement of α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption has been reported for R132 mutations in IDH1, resulting in conversion of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). To determine if cells expressing IDH2 R172K shared this property, we expressed IDH2 wild-type or IDH2 R172K in cells. The accumulation of organic acids, including 2HG, both within cells and in culture medium of the transfectants was then assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after MTBSTFA derivatization of the organic acid pool. We observed a metabolite peak eluting at 32.5 min on GC-MS which was of minimal intensity in the culture medium of IDH2 wild-type expressing cells, but which in the medium of IDH2 R172K expressing cells had a markedly higher intensity approximating that of the glutamate signal (Figures 3A–3B). Mass spectra of this metabolite peak fit that predicted for MTBSTFA-derivatized 2HG, and the peak’s identity as 2HG was additionally confirmed by matching its mass spectra with that obtained by derivatization of commercial 2HG standards (Figure 3C). Similar results were obtained when the intracellular organic acid pool was analyzed. IDH2 R172K expressing cells were found to have an approximately 100-fold increase in the intracellular levels of 2HG compared with the levels detected in vector-transfected and IDH2 wild-type overexpressing cells (Figure 3D). Consistent with previous work, IDH1 R132H expressing cells analyzed in the same experiment had comparable accumulation of 2HG in both cells and in culture medium. 2HG accumulation was not observed in cells overexpressing IDH1 wild-type (data not shown).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Expression of R172K mutant IDH2 elevates 2HG levels within cells and in culture medium Mutant IDH2 produces the (R) enantiomer of 2HG  Cancer-associated mutants of IDH1 produce the (R) enantiomer of 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). To determine the chirality of the 2HG produced by mutant IDH2 and to compare it with that produced by R132H mutant IDH1, we used a two step derivatization method to distinguish the stereoisomers of 2HG by GC-MS: an esterification step with R-(-)-2-butanolic HCl, followed by acetylation of the 2-hydroxyl with acetic anhydride (Kamerling et al., 1981). Test of this method on commercial S(+)-2HG and R(-)-2HG standards demonstrated clear separation of the (S) and (R) enantiomers, and mass spectra of the metabolite peaks confirmed their identity as the O-acetylated di-(-)-2-butyl esters of 2HG (Figure S1A and S1B). By this method, we confirmed the chirality of the 2HG found in cells expressing either R132H mutant IDH1 or R172K mutant IDH2 corresponded exclusively to the (R) enantiomer (Figure S1C and S1D).  Leukemic cells bearing heterozygous R172K IDH2 mutations accumulate 2HG  To determine whether 2HG also accumulates in leukemic cells with either IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutations, we next analyzed the 2HG levels of selected leukemic samples. To date, every IDH1 R132H or IDH2 R172K mutant AML sample has exhibited evidence of 2HG accumulation, demonstrating a 2HG signal intensity by GC-MS analysis that is ≥ 30% of the intrasample glutamate signal. In contrast, control extracts have either had undetectable 2HG or a 2HG signal ≤ 1% of that for glutamate (n=13, p<0.001). Thus leukemic cells bearing either IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutation share the ability to accumulate 2HG in vivo with glioma cells exhibiting IDH1 R132 mutations.  IDH2 is critical for proliferating cells and contributes to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate in the mitochondria  A peculiar feature of the IDH-mutated cancers described to date is their lack of reduction to homozygosity. All tumors with IDH mutations retain one IDH wild-type allele. To address this issue we examined whether wild-type IDH1 and/or IDH2 might play a role in either cell survival or proliferation. Consistent with this possibility, we found that siRNA knockdown of either IDH1 or IDH2 can significantly reduce the proliferative capacity of a cancer cell line expressing both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 (Figure 4A).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Both IDH1 and IDH2 are critical for cell proliferation IDH1 is one of only three cytosolic enzymes that contribute to the NADPH production required for nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis during cell growth (DeBerardinis et al., 2007). In addition, IDH1 contributes to the maintenance of cytosolic redox state (Yan et al., 2009). Therefore, there are several reasons why IDH1 might be important for cell proliferation. However, unlike IDH1, IDH2 resides in the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria normally contain a high level of NADPH and readily interconvert NADH and NADPH (Rydstrom, 2006). Furthermore, it is IDH3, the NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, that is believed to be responsible for isocitrate conversion into α-ketoglutarate in the mitochondrial citric acid cycle (McCormack and Denton, 1979). This raised the possibility that wild-type IDH2 might be contributing to the ability of cancer cells to produce citrate from glutamine, as illustrated in Figure 4B. Such an enzymatic activity, though not ascribed to a particular IDH isoform, was characterized in early metabolic studies (Ochoa, 1948; Siebert et al., 1957). As shown in Figure 2B, when wild-type IDH2 was over-expressed in cells, it was found to consume NADPH in an α-ketoglutarate-dependent manner.  To test the possibility that wild-type IDH2 contributes to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate in the mitochondria of proliferating cells, we labeled cells with [13C-U]-L-glutamine (glutamine +5), and subsequently measured isotopic enrichment in citrate by GC-MS. Enrichment of citrate with five 13C atoms (citrate +5) can arise from the reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate +5 to isocitrate +5, while citrate enriched with four 13C atoms (citrate +4) can arise from oxidative metabolism of α-ketoglutarate through the traditional citric acid cycle (Figure 4B). Both forms of citrate production were reproducibly observed. To examine the role of IDH2 in citrate production, cells were treated with one of two independent IDH2 siRNAs. IDH2 siRNA treated cells displayed a significant reduction in levels of citrate +5, supporting a role for mitochondrial IDH2 in reductive carboxylation. Of note, no change in citrate +4 levels was observed, indicating that the effect of IDH2 knockdown was specific and not affecting other fundamental processes regulating the citric acid cycle (Figure 4C). Similar labeling patterns were observed in aconitate, an intermediate in the isomerization of isocitrate to citrate, with aconitate +5 also reduced following IDH2 knockdown, and aconitate +4 levels remaining unchanged (data not shown). In contrast, when cells were treated with one of two independent siRNAs against IDH3, there was a reproducible increase in citrate +5, while citrate +4 was unchanged (Figure 4D). These data support a role for IDH2 and not IDH3 in the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate by reductive carboxylation in the mitochondria, and provide a possible explanation for the lack of reduction to homozygosity for IDH2 mutations in cancer.  2HG can be used as a screening test for neomorphic IDH mutants  The above data suggest that the common feature of the IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutants is an ability to produce 2HG that can be measured directly in tumor samples. This suggested that screening for the presence of 2HG in tumor samples could be used as an assay to detect IDH mutations. To test this hypothesis, we obtained frozen samples of AML cells from 18 patients aged 50 years or older who presented with normal karyotype AML. All 18 samples were first screened for the intensity of their 2HG signal on GC-MS as a percentage of the intrasample glutamate signal (Table 1 and Figure 5). GC-MS analysis demonstrated that 9 of 18 samples had elevated 2HG. This fraction of samples was much higher than expected from the reported incidence of IDH1 mutation (Mardis et al., 2009). To correlate the results with mutation status, IDH1 and IDH2 were sequenced for all 18 samples in a blinded fashion. All samples displaying a signal ratio for 2HG/glutamate > 1% had either an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation. In contrast, none of the samples with a 2HG/glutamate signal ratio ≤ 1% had an IDH mutation (Table 1). Thus in this sample set, 2HG measurement was predictive of IDH mutation status.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Primary human AML samples with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations display marked elevations of 2HG Table 1 Table 1 Patient characteristics, metabolite analysis, and IDH status. The genetic analysis of these tumor samples revealed two neomorphic IDH mutations that produce 2HG. Among the IDH1 mutations, tumors with IDH1 R132C or IDH1 R132G accumulated 2HG. This result is not unexpected, as a number of mutations of R132 to other residues have also been shown to accumulate 2HG in glioma samples (Dang et al., 2009).  The other neomorphic allele was unexpected. All five of the IDH2 mutations producing 2HG in this sample set contained the same mutation, R140Q. As shown in Figure 1, both R140 in IDH2 and R100 in IDH1 are predicted to interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate. Additional modeling revealed that despite the reduced ability to bind isocitrate, the R140Q mutant IDH2 is predicted to maintain its ability to bind and orient α-ketoglutarate in the active site (Figure 6). This potentially explains the ability of cells with this neomorph to accumulate 2HG in vivo. As shown in Figure 5, samples containing IDH2 R140Q mutations were found to have accumulated 2HG to levels 10–100 fold greater than the highest levels detected in IDH wild-type samples.  Figure 6 Figure 6 Structural modeling of R140Q mutant IDH2 IDH2 mutations are more common than IDH1 mutations in AML  In the above sample set, just over half of the AML samples with 2HG accumulation had IDH2 mutations. This is in contrast to the data reported for gliomas in which less than 5% of IDH mutations were in IDH2 (Hartmann et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Initial studies of IDH genes in leukemia had failed to detect IDH2 mutations in R172 (Mardis et al., 2009). In the 18 cases we examined initially, all of the IDH2 mutations were IDH2 R140Q. However, this sample may have been biased by either the sample size and/or patient selection. We therefore analyzed 78 serial AML samples collected from a single center to determine the frequency of IDH1/2 mutation and investigated the co-association of IDH1/2 mutations with other genes known to contribute to AML pathogenesis (Table 2). While IDH1 mutations were found in 7.7% of samples in this analysis (6/78), twice as many mutations were detected in IDH2, at a frequency of 15.4% (12/78, p<0.05). Both the R140Q and R172K neomorphic alleles of IDH2 were identified. Of note, the IDH2 R140Q mutation was observed in more patients (7/78) than the R172K allele of IDH2 or R132 mutations in IDH1. None of the IDH2-mutated samples were found to also have somatic mutations in Flt-3, NPM1, or ASXL1. Furthermore, IDH2 and IDH1 mutations were only observed in normal karyotype AML patients, whereas known cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in 7/51 samples without IDH1/2 mutations (13.7%; all IDH mutants vs. IDH wild-type, p<0.05). We also examined whether IDH1 and/or IDH2 mutation status had any effect on the overall survival of this set of patients. As was previously reported (Mardis et al., 2009), mutations in IDH1 did not appear to affect overall survival (p=0.37, Figure S2A). However, we noted a trend towards improved survival in patients who presented with IDH2 mutations (p=0.08, Figure S2B).  Table 2 Table 2 Clinical and genetic parameters of IDH1/2 wild-type and mutant AML samples. Go to: DISCUSSION Neomorphic enzymatic activity to produce 2HG is the shared feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations  Mutations in the cytosolic enzyme IDH1 have been reported in a high percentage of gliomas and a significant subset of AML patients (Mardis et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Recently, IDH1 mutations of R132 were associated with the accumulation of the metabolite 2HG in glial tumor samples (Dang et al., 2009). The discovery of an elderly AML patient with an IDH2 R172 mutation, the analogous residue to IDH1 R132, prompted us to test whether this IDH2 mutation also resulted in a gain-of-function ability to catalyze the conversion of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG. In this study of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in AML, we have demonstrated that 2HG production is a common feature of the spontaneous mutations in these two IDH homologs. By showing that 2HG production can result from mutation at any of three residues which normally stabilize the β-carboxyl of isocitrate, IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172, and IDH2 R140, we demonstrate that it is the truncated, non-carboxylating, reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate that is the common feature linking all cancer-associated IDH mutations.  2HG as a screening and diagnostic marker  With our demonstration that 2HG production is the common feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, the measurement of 2HG levels allowed us to identify additional IDH mutations in AML patients. This is exemplified in this study by the use of 2HG screening to identify two distinct mutations in IDH2, R140Q and R172K, that produce 2HG. These data demonstrate that at least IDH2 neomorphic mutations are not limited to a single arginine residue. Therefore, additional IDH1 and IDH2 neomorphic alleles may still remain to be found in gliomas, hematopoietic malignancies, and in other cancers. The 2HG levels in cancers with IDH mutations are consistently 10–100 fold elevated over levels found in samples lacking mutations of IDH1 or IDH2. Inborn errors of metabolism which lead to 2HG elevation are exceptionally rare and have devastating developmental consequences (Kolker et al., 2002a). Tumors displaying elevated 2HG are unlikely to be false positives. Thus, 2HG appears to be an important marker of IDH1/2-mutated neoplasms. Given the quantities of 2HG that accumulate in the culture medium of cells expressing IDH mutant enzymes, 2HG may even be detectable in the peripheral blood of leukemia patients with IDH mutations at the time of presentation. We are currently testing the potential of such a screening and diagnostic approach.  Maintaining at least one IDH1 and IDH2 wild-type allele may be essential for transformed cells  2HG production is a shared feature of heterozygous mutations in either cytosolic IDH1 or mitochondrial IDH2. There is a marked difference in the enzymatic rate of isocitrate-dependent NADPH production by the wild-type proteins and α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption by both IDH1 and IDH2 mutants (Figure 2 and Dang et al., 2009). Nevertheless, both mutant proteins lead to an over 100-fold increase in tumor 2HG accumulation. In addition, it appears that both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 can play positive and non-redundant roles in cell proliferation. The roles of IDH1 and IDH2 in supporting cell proliferation are likely to be different. IDH1 contributes to cytosolic NADPH production. In the case of IDH1 mutant proteins, it has been reported that a local supply of NADPH and α-ketoglutarate is required to drive 2HG production (Dang et al., 2009). In the context of a wild-type/mutant IDH1 heterodimer, the required substrates for the mutant’s neomorphic activity are most readily provided by the wild-type subunit’s normal activity on NADP+ and isocitrate. However, for the neomorphic activity of mitochondrial IDH2 mutants, the requirement for local generation of substrate is unlikely to be absolute. Mitochondria typically have a high NADPH/NADP+ ratio, supported in part by the ability to interconvert NADPH and NADH in the matrix (Rydstrom, 2006). In addition, mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate is maintained at high levels by a variety of anaplerotic substrates. While the exact role of wild-type IDH2 in supporting cell growth will require further investigation, this requirement correlates with the ability of IDH2 to contribute to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate via a pathway of reductive carboxylation in the mitochondria of proliferating cells.  2HG as an onco-metabolite  Although 2HG has been proposed to increase ROS levels in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism (Kolker et al., 2002b; Latini et al., 2003), to date we have no evidence that the metabolite acts as a mutagen. This is consistent with data presented here that IDH1-mutated and IDH2-mutated AML samples typically do not harbor other known mutations associated with AML, as well as a prior report that IDH-mutated gliomas often lack other mutations that are commonly acquired early in glioma pathogenesis (Yan et al., 2009). In an AML case with an IDH1 mutation that was sequenced in its entirety (Mardis et al., 2009), there were a relatively small total number of somatic, non-synonymous mutations. However, a possibility by which 2HG might contribute to tumorigenesis emerges from consideration of the tumor subtypes in which IDH mutations are found with high frequency: gliomas with mixed astrocytic and oligodendroglial features, and acute myeloid leukemias. In both cases, proliferation of a relatively undifferentiated cell population is central to the disease, and pathogenesis is marked by a block to differentiation rather than simply by an increase in proliferative rate. Thus, one may speculate that 2HG’s effect in the tumor and its microenvironment is to block cellular differentiation. Whether cells carrying a mutant IDH transgene exhibit a block to differentiation in vivo will need to be examined. The production of lineage-specific mutant IDH transgenic animals or hematopoetic bone marrow reconstitution following retroviral introduction of a mutant IDH will allow future studies to test this hypothesis.  Whether 2HG fits into the broad class of mutagens or plays a distinct role in carcinogenesis remains to be determined. For now, it appears to represent a highly correlative maker for an emerging class of somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes. Importantly, these mutations appear to define a significant subset of CNS tumors and leukemias. The identification of frequent IDH2 mutations in AML increases the significance of this family of mutations in understanding the pathogenesis of AML. Taken together, IDH mutations occur in 23% of samples analyzed here. All IDH mutations reported to date share the neomorphic ability to produce high levels of tumor 2HG. Future studies are required to understand the role of 2HG in leukemic transformation and to elucidate the role of IDH1/IDH2 in the pathogenesis of AML.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Patient selection and statistical analysis  Patient samples were obtained from either the Stem Cell and Xenotransplantation Core Facility of the University of Pennsylvania or from the tissue collections of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute. Approval was obtained from the institutional review boards at the University of Pennsylvania (IRB protocol 703185) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute (IRB protocols 95–091 and 06–107), and informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All samples were collected after de-identification for these studies. For assessing clinical and genetic parameters of IDH1/2 wild-type and mutant AML, 78 serial samples from AML patients referred for molecular testing at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were examined. For 2HG assays, patient samples were obtained from the Stem Cell and Xenotransplantation Core Facility of the University of Pennsylvania. The initial 18 samples were selected from de-identified AML patients aged 50 years or older at diagnosis with lesions determined to have normal cytogenetic status. Cells used for these assays were prepared by Ficoll separation of mononuclear cells (MNCs) from peripheral blood or bone marrow. MNCs were frozen as viable cells in 10% DMSO. Student’s t test and Chi-square analysis were used to analyze data. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.  Sequence Analysis of IDH1 and IDH2  Genomic DNA was extracted from bone marrow mononuclear cells or from sorted leukemic cells; for samples with less than 70% blasts flow cytometric sorting (FACSAria) was used to isolate blast cells according to leukemic blast immunophenotype before DNA isolation. High-throughput DNA sequence analysis was used to screen for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. All DNA samples were whole genome amplified using Ø29 polymerase and mutations were validated on unamplified DNA to ensure all mutations were present in the diagnostic sample. Sequencing of IDH1 used primers which cover amino acid residues 41–138 (sense, 5’-TGTGTTGAGATGGACGCCTA-3’; antisense, 5’-GGTGTACTCAGAGCCTTCGC-3’). Sequencing of IDH2 used primers which cover amino acid residues 125–226 (sense, 5’-CTGCCTCTTTGTGGCCTAAG-3’; antisense, 5’-ATTCTGGTTGAAAGATGGCG-3’). Sequence analysis was performed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College PA) and all mutations were validated by repeat PCR and sequencing on unamplified DNA from the archival sample.  Structural modeling  Human IDH2 has 97% homology with pig IDH2, and none of the 13 residues that are different (out of 418 total, excluding the N-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence) are found in the active site. A PDB structure of pig IDH2 is available, with isocitrate in the active site (1LWD) (Ceccarelli et al., 2002). Based on the highly homologous pig structure, conservative structural models of human IDH2 were built with the CHARMM molecular mechanics package using the CHARMM27 force field. To model wild-type IDH2 with isocitrate, the 13 residues of 1LWD differing between pig and human were first changed to the human sequence. The side chains were then rebuilt, hydrogen atoms added to all residues, the substrate, active site Mn2+ ions, and conserved residues were restrained, and the structure minimized allowing only the changed residues to relax. For the α-ketoglutarate complexes, the substrate conformation/pose was first modeled on isocitrate by removing the β-carboxyl group and replacing it with a hydrogen. The wild-type IDH2-α-ketoglutarate complex was then minimized allowing only the active site residues (as defined in entry 1LWD) and substrate to relax. The R140Q mutant IDH2-α-ketoglutarate complex was subsequently modeled by changing arginine 140 to glutamine, and rebuilding the side chain. The structure was then minimized in two stages. First the mutated residue was allowed to relax, followed by a second relaxation of the active site residues, Mn2+, and substrate. All modeling images were generated using PyMOL Viewer (DeLano, 2002).  Constructing IDH1 and IDH2 mutants  The cDNA clone of human IDH2 (BC009244) was purchased from Invitrogen in pOTB7. Human IDH1 (BC012846.1) was purchased from ATCC in pCMV-Sport6. Standard site-directed mutagenesis techniques were used to generate IDH2 R172K by introducing a g515a change in the IDH2 open reading frame (ORF). IDH1 R132H was made by introducing a g395a base pair change in the IDH1 ORF. Wild-type and mutant sequences were then subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and confirmed by direct sequencing before expression in mammalian cells.  Cell culture, transfection, and metabolic labeling  293T cells and Bcl-xL-transfected SF188 cells (SF188) were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (CellGro). For expression of wild-type and mutant IDH1 and IDH2, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For IDH siRNA experiments, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMax, with oligonucleotides obtained from Sigma-Proligo. For metabolic labeling experiments, cells were cultured in glutamine-free DMEM supplemented with 4 mM [13C-U]-L-glutamine (Cambridge Isotope) for the 3h prior to metabolite extraction.  Cell lysate based enzyme assays  For IDH2 enzymatic assays, cells were lysed 48 h following transfection, using mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma). Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000g at 4 °C. Supernatants were then collected and normalized for total protein concentration. To measure IDH oxidative activity, 0.3 µg of lysate protein was added to 200 µl of an assay solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1.3 mM MnCl2, 0.33 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM β-NADP+, and 0.1 mM D-(+)-threo-isocitrate. The increase in 340 nm absorbance (OD340) as a measure of NADPH production was measured every 20 s for 30 min on a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Data are plotted as the mean activity of 3 replicates per lysate averaged among 5 time points centered at every 5 minutes. To measure IDH reductive activity, 3 µg of lysate protein was added to 200 µl of an assay solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.3 mM MnCl2, 0.01 mM β-NADPH, and 0.5 mM α-ketoglutarate. NADPH consumption was measured as the decrease in OD340, with 3 replicates per lysate. For all experiments, OD340 changes in assay buffer lacking lysate protein were measured and subsequently subtracted from the OD340 changes measured in lysate replicates to arrive at final values.  Western blot  To measure IDH2 levels in cell lysates used for enzymatic assays, aliquots of the same lysates used in activity measurements were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with IDH2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam, ab55271), and then detected with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare, NA931V). For assessing IDH knockdown in siRNA experiments, cells treated in parallel with those used for labeling or proliferative studies were lysed 48 h following transfection in standard RIPA buffer (1% NaDOC, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01 M Tris pH 8.0, 0.14 M NaCl), and then probed with IDH2 antibody as above, IDH1 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc49996), or IDH3A rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, ab58641). Actin antibody (Santa Cruz, sc1616) was also used to assess equal protein loading of Western blots.  Metabolite extraction  Cellular organic acids were extracted as previously described (Bennett et al., 2008). Briefly, after gentle removal of culture medium from proliferating cells, or freezing medium from frozen viable AML samples, cells were rapidly quenched with 80% methanol, chilled to −80°C, and then incubated at −80°C for 15 min. Extracts were subsequently transferred and centrifuged at 14,000g for 20 min. at 4°C. The organic acid pool in the supernatant was further purified by drying under nitrogen gas, redissolving in deionized water, and then elution from an AG-1 ×8 100–200 anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad) in 3 N HCl after washing with five column volumes. For media analysis, culture medium from transfected cells 24–48 h following transfection was collected and diluted five-fold with methanol. After centrifugation at 14,000g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated protein, supernatants were dried under nitrogen gas, and organic acids were purified as described above.  Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis  After drying the HCl eluate, samples were redissolved in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA; Regis) and heated for 1 h at 60°C to derivatize prior to GC-MS analysis. Samples were injected into an Agilent 7890A GC with an HP-5MS capillary column, connected to an Agilent 5975C Mass selective detector operating in splitless mode using electron impact ionization with ionizing voltage of −70 eV and electron multiplier set to 1060 V. GC temperature was started at 100 °C for 3 min, ramped to 230 °C at 4 °C/min and held for 4 min, then ramped to 300 °C and held for 5 min. Mass range of 50–500 amu was recorded at 2.71 scans/sec. Isotopic enrichment in citric acid was monitored using ions at m/e− 463 and 464 for citrate +4 and citrate +5 (containing 4 and 5 13C-enriched atoms, respectively), formed through loss of a t-butyl (−57 amu) and t-butyldimethylsilanol (−132 amu) from the molecular ion tetra-TBDMS-citric acid (648 amu). Isotopomer distributions were simultaneously corrected for naturally occurring heavy isotopes of all elements in each mass fragment using a correction matrix as previously described (Weckwerth, 2007). Identification of the 2HG metabolite peak was confirmed using standards obtained from Sigma. 2HG and glutamate signal intensities were quantified by integration of peak areas.  Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)  Organic acids from cellular extracts were purified as described above, followed by evaporation to dryness under nitrogen. After redissolving samples in deionized water, citrate was detected on two different LC-MS approaches, both of which gave comparable results. In both cases, LC separation was by reversed phase chromatography using tributylamine as an ion pairing agent (Lu et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2007) with ionization by negative electrospray at 23 kV. The first MS approach used a Thermo Discovery Max triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode, with citrate quantified using the reaction 191 → 87 at 20 eV. Additional reactions for every possible labeled form of citrate were also monitored using variations of the same transition. Reactions used to monitor other TCA components have been described previously (Bajad et al., 2006). The second MS approach used a Thermo Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer operated at 100,000 mass resolving power, with citrate and its isotope-labeled forms quantified based on extracted ion chromatograms at their exact masses.  SIGNIFICANCE  Most cancer-associated enzyme mutations result in either catalytic inactivation or constitutive activation. Here we report that the common feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations observed in AML and glioma is the acquisition of an enzymatic activity not shared by either wild-type enzyme. The product of this neomorphic enzyme activity can be readily detected in tumor samples and we show that tumor metabolite analysis can identify patients with tumor-associated IDH mutations. Using this method, we discovered a 2HG-producing IDH2 mutation, IDH2 R140Q, that was present in 9% of serial AML samples. Overall, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were observed in over 23% of AML patients.  HIGHLIGHTS  All IDH mutations reported in cancer share a common neomorphic enzymatic activity. Both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 are required for cell proliferation. IDH2 R140Q mutations occur in 9% of AML cases. Overall, IDH2 mutations appear more common than IDH1 mutations in AML.  
1769||The somatic mutations in cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) observed in gliomas can lead to the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Here, we report that tumor 2HG is elevated in a high percentage of patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Surprisingly, less than half of cases with elevated 2HG possessed IDH1 mutations. The remaining cases with elevated 2HG had mutations in IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. These data demonstrate that a shared feature of all cancer-associated IDH mutations is production of the onco-metabolite 2HG. Furthermore, AML patients with IDH mutations display a significantly reduced number of other well characterized AML-associated mutations and/or associated chromosomal abnormalities, potentially implicating IDH mutation in a distinct mechanism of AML pathogenesis.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Mutations in human cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase I (IDH1) occur somatically in >70% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas, and in 8.5% of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) (Mardis et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Mutations have also been reported in cancers of the colon and prostate (Kang et al., 2009; Sjoblom et al., 2006). To date, all reported IDH1 mutations result in an amino acid substitution at a single arginine residue in the enzyme’s active site, R132. A subset of intermediate grade gliomas lacking mutations in IDH1 have been found to harbor mutations in IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. The IDH2 mutations which have been identified in gliomas occur at the analogous residue to IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172. Both IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutants lack the wild-type enzyme’s ability to convert isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (Yan et al., 2009). To date, all reported IDH1 or IDH2 mutations are heterozygous, with the cancer cells retaining one wild-type copy of the relevant IDH1 or IDH2 allele. No patient has been reported with both an IDH1 and IDH2 mutation. These data argue against the IDH mutations resulting in a simple loss of function.  Normally both cytosolic IDH1 and mitochondrial IDH2 exist as homodimers within their respective cellular compartments, and the mutant proteins retain the ability to bind to their respective wild-type partner. Therefore, it has been proposed that mutant IDH1 can act as a dominant negative against wild-type IDH1 function, resulting in a decrease in cytosolic α-ketoglutarate levels and leading to an indirect activation of the HIF-1α pathway (Zhao et al., 2009). However, recent work has provided an alternative explanation. The R132H IDH1 mutation observed in gliomas was found to display a gain of function for the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) (Dang et al., 2009). This in vitro activity was confirmed when 2HG was found to be elevated in IDH1-mutated gliomas. Whether this neomorphic activity is a common feature shared by IDH2 mutations was not determined.  IDH1 R132 mutations identical to those reported to produce 2HG in gliomas were recently reported in AML (Mardis et al., 2009). These IDH1 R132 mutations were observed in 8.5% of AML patients studied, and a significantly higher percentage of mutation was observed in the subset of patients whose tumors lacked cytogenetic abnormalities. IDH2 R172 mutations were not observed in this study. However, during efforts to confirm and extend these findings, we found an IDH2 R172K mutation in an AML sample obtained from a 77 year old female. This finding confirmed that both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations can occur in AML and prompted us to more comprehensively investigate the role of IDH2 in AML.  The present study was undertaken to see if IDH2 mutations might share the same neomorphic activity as recently reported for glioma-associated IDH1 R132 mutations. We also determined whether tumor-associated 2HG elevation could prospectively identify AML patients with mutations in IDH. To investigate the lack of reduction to homozygosity for either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations in tumor samples, the ability of wild-type IDH1 and/or IDH2 to contribute to cell proliferation was examined.  Go to: RESULTS IDH2 is mutated in AML  A recent study employing a whole-genome sequencing strategy in an AML patient resulted in the identification of somatic IDH1 mutations in AML (Mardis et al., 2009). Based on the report that IDH2 mutations were also observed in the other major tumor type in which IDH1 mutations were implicated (Yan et al., 2009), we sequenced the IDH2 gene in a set of de-identified AML DNA samples. Several cases with IDH2 R172 mutations were identified. In the initial case, the IDH2 mutation found, R172K, was the same mutation reported in glioma samples. It has been recently reported that cancer-associated IDH1 R132 mutants display a loss-of-function for the use of isocitrate as substrate, with a concomitant gain-of-function for the reduction of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). This prompted us to determine if the recurrent R172K mutation in IDH2 observed in both gliomas and leukemias might also display the same neomorphic activity. In IDH1, the role of R132 in determining IDH1 enzymatic activity is consistent with the stabilizing charge interaction of its guanidinium moiety with the β-carboxyl group of isocitrate (Figure 1A). This β-carboxyl is critical for IDH’s ability to catalyze the interconversion of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate, with the overall reaction occurring in two steps through a β-carboxyl-containing intermediate (Ehrlich and Colman, 1976). Proceeding in the oxidative direction, this β-carboxyl remains on the substrate throughout the IDH reaction until the final decarboxylating step which produces α-ketoglutarate.  Figure 1 Figure 1 IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 are analogous residues that both interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 are analogous residues that both interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate  To understand how R172 mutations in IDH2 might relate to the R132 mutations in IDH1 characterized for gliomas, we modeled human IDH2 based on the pig IDH2 structure containing bound isocitrate (Ceccarelli et al., 2002). Human and pig IDH2 protein share over 97% identity and all active site residues are identical. The active site of human IDH2 was structurally aligned with human IDH1 (Figure 1). Similar to IDH1, in the active site of IDH2 the isocitrate substrate is stabilized by multiple charge interactions throughout the binding pocket. Moreover, like R132 in IDH1, the analogous R172 in IDH2 is predicted to interact strongly with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate. This raised the possibility that cancer-associated IDH2 mutations at R172 might affect enzymatic interconversion of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate similarly to IDH1 mutations at R132.  Mutation of IDH2 R172K enhances α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption  To test whether cancer-associated IDH2 R172K mutations shared the gain of function in α-ketoglutarate reduction observed for IDH1 R132 mutations (Dang et al., 2009), we overexpressed wild-type or R172K mutant IDH2 in cells with endogenous wild-type IDH2 expression, and then assessed isocitrate-dependent NADPH production and α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates. As reported previously (Yan et al., 2009), extracts from cells expressing the R172K mutant IDH2 did not display isocitrate-dependent NADPH production above the levels observed in extracts from vector-transfected cells. In contrast, extracts from cells expressing a comparable amount of wild-type IDH2 markedly increased isocitrate-dependent NADPH production (Figure 2A). However, when these same extracts were tested for NADPH consumption in the presence of α-ketoglutarate, R172K mutant IDH2 expression was found to correlate with a significant enhancement to α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption. Vector-transfected cell lysates did not demonstrate this activity (Figure 2B). Although not nearly to the same degree as with the mutant enzyme, wild-type IDH2 overexpression also reproducibly enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption under these conditions.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Expression of R172K mutant IDH2 results in enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent consumption of NADPH Mutation of IDH2 R172K results in elevated 2HG levels  R172K mutant IDH2 lacks the guanidinium moiety in residue 172 that normally stabilizes β-carboxyl addition in the interconversion of α-ketoglutarate and isocitrate. Yet R172K mutant IDH2 exhibited enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates (Figure 2B). A similar enhancement of α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption has been reported for R132 mutations in IDH1, resulting in conversion of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). To determine if cells expressing IDH2 R172K shared this property, we expressed IDH2 wild-type or IDH2 R172K in cells. The accumulation of organic acids, including 2HG, both within cells and in culture medium of the transfectants was then assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after MTBSTFA derivatization of the organic acid pool. We observed a metabolite peak eluting at 32.5 min on GC-MS which was of minimal intensity in the culture medium of IDH2 wild-type expressing cells, but which in the medium of IDH2 R172K expressing cells had a markedly higher intensity approximating that of the glutamate signal (Figures 3A–3B). Mass spectra of this metabolite peak fit that predicted for MTBSTFA-derivatized 2HG, and the peak’s identity as 2HG was additionally confirmed by matching its mass spectra with that obtained by derivatization of commercial 2HG standards (Figure 3C). Similar results were obtained when the intracellular organic acid pool was analyzed. IDH2 R172K expressing cells were found to have an approximately 100-fold increase in the intracellular levels of 2HG compared with the levels detected in vector-transfected and IDH2 wild-type overexpressing cells (Figure 3D). Consistent with previous work, IDH1 R132H expressing cells analyzed in the same experiment had comparable accumulation of 2HG in both cells and in culture medium. 2HG accumulation was not observed in cells overexpressing IDH1 wild-type (data not shown).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Expression of R172K mutant IDH2 elevates 2HG levels within cells and in culture medium Mutant IDH2 produces the (R) enantiomer of 2HG  Cancer-associated mutants of IDH1 produce the (R) enantiomer of 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). To determine the chirality of the 2HG produced by mutant IDH2 and to compare it with that produced by R132H mutant IDH1, we used a two step derivatization method to distinguish the stereoisomers of 2HG by GC-MS: an esterification step with R-(-)-2-butanolic HCl, followed by acetylation of the 2-hydroxyl with acetic anhydride (Kamerling et al., 1981). Test of this method on commercial S(+)-2HG and R(-)-2HG standards demonstrated clear separation of the (S) and (R) enantiomers, and mass spectra of the metabolite peaks confirmed their identity as the O-acetylated di-(-)-2-butyl esters of 2HG (Figure S1A and S1B). By this method, we confirmed the chirality of the 2HG found in cells expressing either R132H mutant IDH1 or R172K mutant IDH2 corresponded exclusively to the (R) enantiomer (Figure S1C and S1D).  Leukemic cells bearing heterozygous R172K IDH2 mutations accumulate 2HG  To determine whether 2HG also accumulates in leukemic cells with either IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutations, we next analyzed the 2HG levels of selected leukemic samples. To date, every IDH1 R132H or IDH2 R172K mutant AML sample has exhibited evidence of 2HG accumulation, demonstrating a 2HG signal intensity by GC-MS analysis that is ≥ 30% of the intrasample glutamate signal. In contrast, control extracts have either had undetectable 2HG or a 2HG signal ≤ 1% of that for glutamate (n=13, p<0.001). Thus leukemic cells bearing either IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutation share the ability to accumulate 2HG in vivo with glioma cells exhibiting IDH1 R132 mutations.  IDH2 is critical for proliferating cells and contributes to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate in the mitochondria  A peculiar feature of the IDH-mutated cancers described to date is their lack of reduction to homozygosity. All tumors with IDH mutations retain one IDH wild-type allele. To address this issue we examined whether wild-type IDH1 and/or IDH2 might play a role in either cell survival or proliferation. Consistent with this possibility, we found that siRNA knockdown of either IDH1 or IDH2 can significantly reduce the proliferative capacity of a cancer cell line expressing both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 (Figure 4A).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Both IDH1 and IDH2 are critical for cell proliferation IDH1 is one of only three cytosolic enzymes that contribute to the NADPH production required for nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis during cell growth (DeBerardinis et al., 2007). In addition, IDH1 contributes to the maintenance of cytosolic redox state (Yan et al., 2009). Therefore, there are several reasons why IDH1 might be important for cell proliferation. However, unlike IDH1, IDH2 resides in the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria normally contain a high level of NADPH and readily interconvert NADH and NADPH (Rydstrom, 2006). Furthermore, it is IDH3, the NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, that is believed to be responsible for isocitrate conversion into α-ketoglutarate in the mitochondrial citric acid cycle (McCormack and Denton, 1979). This raised the possibility that wild-type IDH2 might be contributing to the ability of cancer cells to produce citrate from glutamine, as illustrated in Figure 4B. Such an enzymatic activity, though not ascribed to a particular IDH isoform, was characterized in early metabolic studies (Ochoa, 1948; Siebert et al., 1957). As shown in Figure 2B, when wild-type IDH2 was over-expressed in cells, it was found to consume NADPH in an α-ketoglutarate-dependent manner.  To test the possibility that wild-type IDH2 contributes to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate in the mitochondria of proliferating cells, we labeled cells with [13C-U]-L-glutamine (glutamine +5), and subsequently measured isotopic enrichment in citrate by GC-MS. Enrichment of citrate with five 13C atoms (citrate +5) can arise from the reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate +5 to isocitrate +5, while citrate enriched with four 13C atoms (citrate +4) can arise from oxidative metabolism of α-ketoglutarate through the traditional citric acid cycle (Figure 4B). Both forms of citrate production were reproducibly observed. To examine the role of IDH2 in citrate production, cells were treated with one of two independent IDH2 siRNAs. IDH2 siRNA treated cells displayed a significant reduction in levels of citrate +5, supporting a role for mitochondrial IDH2 in reductive carboxylation. Of note, no change in citrate +4 levels was observed, indicating that the effect of IDH2 knockdown was specific and not affecting other fundamental processes regulating the citric acid cycle (Figure 4C). Similar labeling patterns were observed in aconitate, an intermediate in the isomerization of isocitrate to citrate, with aconitate +5 also reduced following IDH2 knockdown, and aconitate +4 levels remaining unchanged (data not shown). In contrast, when cells were treated with one of two independent siRNAs against IDH3, there was a reproducible increase in citrate +5, while citrate +4 was unchanged (Figure 4D). These data support a role for IDH2 and not IDH3 in the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate by reductive carboxylation in the mitochondria, and provide a possible explanation for the lack of reduction to homozygosity for IDH2 mutations in cancer.  2HG can be used as a screening test for neomorphic IDH mutants  The above data suggest that the common feature of the IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutants is an ability to produce 2HG that can be measured directly in tumor samples. This suggested that screening for the presence of 2HG in tumor samples could be used as an assay to detect IDH mutations. To test this hypothesis, we obtained frozen samples of AML cells from 18 patients aged 50 years or older who presented with normal karyotype AML. All 18 samples were first screened for the intensity of their 2HG signal on GC-MS as a percentage of the intrasample glutamate signal (Table 1 and Figure 5). GC-MS analysis demonstrated that 9 of 18 samples had elevated 2HG. This fraction of samples was much higher than expected from the reported incidence of IDH1 mutation (Mardis et al., 2009). To correlate the results with mutation status, IDH1 and IDH2 were sequenced for all 18 samples in a blinded fashion. All samples displaying a signal ratio for 2HG/glutamate > 1% had either an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation. In contrast, none of the samples with a 2HG/glutamate signal ratio ≤ 1% had an IDH mutation (Table 1). Thus in this sample set, 2HG measurement was predictive of IDH mutation status.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Primary human AML samples with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations display marked elevations of 2HG Table 1 Table 1 Patient characteristics, metabolite analysis, and IDH status. The genetic analysis of these tumor samples revealed two neomorphic IDH mutations that produce 2HG. Among the IDH1 mutations, tumors with IDH1 R132C or IDH1 R132G accumulated 2HG. This result is not unexpected, as a number of mutations of R132 to other residues have also been shown to accumulate 2HG in glioma samples (Dang et al., 2009).  The other neomorphic allele was unexpected. All five of the IDH2 mutations producing 2HG in this sample set contained the same mutation, R140Q. As shown in Figure 1, both R140 in IDH2 and R100 in IDH1 are predicted to interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate. Additional modeling revealed that despite the reduced ability to bind isocitrate, the R140Q mutant IDH2 is predicted to maintain its ability to bind and orient α-ketoglutarate in the active site (Figure 6). This potentially explains the ability of cells with this neomorph to accumulate 2HG in vivo. As shown in Figure 5, samples containing IDH2 R140Q mutations were found to have accumulated 2HG to levels 10–100 fold greater than the highest levels detected in IDH wild-type samples.  Figure 6 Figure 6 Structural modeling of R140Q mutant IDH2 IDH2 mutations are more common than IDH1 mutations in AML  In the above sample set, just over half of the AML samples with 2HG accumulation had IDH2 mutations. This is in contrast to the data reported for gliomas in which less than 5% of IDH mutations were in IDH2 (Hartmann et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Initial studies of IDH genes in leukemia had failed to detect IDH2 mutations in R172 (Mardis et al., 2009). In the 18 cases we examined initially, all of the IDH2 mutations were IDH2 R140Q. However, this sample may have been biased by either the sample size and/or patient selection. We therefore analyzed 78 serial AML samples collected from a single center to determine the frequency of IDH1/2 mutation and investigated the co-association of IDH1/2 mutations with other genes known to contribute to AML pathogenesis (Table 2). While IDH1 mutations were found in 7.7% of samples in this analysis (6/78), twice as many mutations were detected in IDH2, at a frequency of 15.4% (12/78, p<0.05). Both the R140Q and R172K neomorphic alleles of IDH2 were identified. Of note, the IDH2 R140Q mutation was observed in more patients (7/78) than the R172K allele of IDH2 or R132 mutations in IDH1. None of the IDH2-mutated samples were found to also have somatic mutations in Flt-3, NPM1, or ASXL1. Furthermore, IDH2 and IDH1 mutations were only observed in normal karyotype AML patients, whereas known cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in 7/51 samples without IDH1/2 mutations (13.7%; all IDH mutants vs. IDH wild-type, p<0.05). We also examined whether IDH1 and/or IDH2 mutation status had any effect on the overall survival of this set of patients. As was previously reported (Mardis et al., 2009), mutations in IDH1 did not appear to affect overall survival (p=0.37, Figure S2A). However, we noted a trend towards improved survival in patients who presented with IDH2 mutations (p=0.08, Figure S2B).  Table 2 Table 2 Clinical and genetic parameters of IDH1/2 wild-type and mutant AML samples. Go to: DISCUSSION Neomorphic enzymatic activity to produce 2HG is the shared feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations  Mutations in the cytosolic enzyme IDH1 have been reported in a high percentage of gliomas and a significant subset of AML patients (Mardis et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Recently, IDH1 mutations of R132 were associated with the accumulation of the metabolite 2HG in glial tumor samples (Dang et al., 2009). The discovery of an elderly AML patient with an IDH2 R172 mutation, the analogous residue to IDH1 R132, prompted us to test whether this IDH2 mutation also resulted in a gain-of-function ability to catalyze the conversion of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG. In this study of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in AML, we have demonstrated that 2HG production is a common feature of the spontaneous mutations in these two IDH homologs. By showing that 2HG production can result from mutation at any of three residues which normally stabilize the β-carboxyl of isocitrate, IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172, and IDH2 R140, we demonstrate that it is the truncated, non-carboxylating, reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate that is the common feature linking all cancer-associated IDH mutations.  2HG as a screening and diagnostic marker  With our demonstration that 2HG production is the common feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, the measurement of 2HG levels allowed us to identify additional IDH mutations in AML patients. This is exemplified in this study by the use of 2HG screening to identify two distinct mutations in IDH2, R140Q and R172K, that produce 2HG. These data demonstrate that at least IDH2 neomorphic mutations are not limited to a single arginine residue. Therefore, additional IDH1 and IDH2 neomorphic alleles may still remain to be found in gliomas, hematopoietic malignancies, and in other cancers. The 2HG levels in cancers with IDH mutations are consistently 10–100 fold elevated over levels found in samples lacking mutations of IDH1 or IDH2. Inborn errors of metabolism which lead to 2HG elevation are exceptionally rare and have devastating developmental consequences (Kolker et al., 2002a). Tumors displaying elevated 2HG are unlikely to be false positives. Thus, 2HG appears to be an important marker of IDH1/2-mutated neoplasms. Given the quantities of 2HG that accumulate in the culture medium of cells expressing IDH mutant enzymes, 2HG may even be detectable in the peripheral blood of leukemia patients with IDH mutations at the time of presentation. We are currently testing the potential of such a screening and diagnostic approach.  Maintaining at least one IDH1 and IDH2 wild-type allele may be essential for transformed cells  2HG production is a shared feature of heterozygous mutations in either cytosolic IDH1 or mitochondrial IDH2. There is a marked difference in the enzymatic rate of isocitrate-dependent NADPH production by the wild-type proteins and α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption by both IDH1 and IDH2 mutants (Figure 2 and Dang et al., 2009). Nevertheless, both mutant proteins lead to an over 100-fold increase in tumor 2HG accumulation. In addition, it appears that both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 can play positive and non-redundant roles in cell proliferation. The roles of IDH1 and IDH2 in supporting cell proliferation are likely to be different. IDH1 contributes to cytosolic NADPH production. In the case of IDH1 mutant proteins, it has been reported that a local supply of NADPH and α-ketoglutarate is required to drive 2HG production (Dang et al., 2009). In the context of a wild-type/mutant IDH1 heterodimer, the required substrates for the mutant’s neomorphic activity are most readily provided by the wild-type subunit’s normal activity on NADP+ and isocitrate. However, for the neomorphic activity of mitochondrial IDH2 mutants, the requirement for local generation of substrate is unlikely to be absolute. Mitochondria typically have a high NADPH/NADP+ ratio, supported in part by the ability to interconvert NADPH and NADH in the matrix (Rydstrom, 2006). In addition, mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate is maintained at high levels by a variety of anaplerotic substrates. While the exact role of wild-type IDH2 in supporting cell growth will require further investigation, this requirement correlates with the ability of IDH2 to contribute to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate via a pathway of reductive carboxylation in the mitochondria of proliferating cells.  2HG as an onco-metabolite  Although 2HG has been proposed to increase ROS levels in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism (Kolker et al., 2002b; Latini et al., 2003), to date we have no evidence that the metabolite acts as a mutagen. This is consistent with data presented here that IDH1-mutated and IDH2-mutated AML samples typically do not harbor other known mutations associated with AML, as well as a prior report that IDH-mutated gliomas often lack other mutations that are commonly acquired early in glioma pathogenesis (Yan et al., 2009). In an AML case with an IDH1 mutation that was sequenced in its entirety (Mardis et al., 2009), there were a relatively small total number of somatic, non-synonymous mutations. However, a possibility by which 2HG might contribute to tumorigenesis emerges from consideration of the tumor subtypes in which IDH mutations are found with high frequency: gliomas with mixed astrocytic and oligodendroglial features, and acute myeloid leukemias. In both cases, proliferation of a relatively undifferentiated cell population is central to the disease, and pathogenesis is marked by a block to differentiation rather than simply by an increase in proliferative rate. Thus, one may speculate that 2HG’s effect in the tumor and its microenvironment is to block cellular differentiation. Whether cells carrying a mutant IDH transgene exhibit a block to differentiation in vivo will need to be examined. The production of lineage-specific mutant IDH transgenic animals or hematopoetic bone marrow reconstitution following retroviral introduction of a mutant IDH will allow future studies to test this hypothesis.  Whether 2HG fits into the broad class of mutagens or plays a distinct role in carcinogenesis remains to be determined. For now, it appears to represent a highly correlative maker for an emerging class of somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes. Importantly, these mutations appear to define a significant subset of CNS tumors and leukemias. The identification of frequent IDH2 mutations in AML increases the significance of this family of mutations in understanding the pathogenesis of AML. Taken together, IDH mutations occur in 23% of samples analyzed here. All IDH mutations reported to date share the neomorphic ability to produce high levels of tumor 2HG. Future studies are required to understand the role of 2HG in leukemic transformation and to elucidate the role of IDH1/IDH2 in the pathogenesis of AML.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Patient selection and statistical analysis  Patient samples were obtained from either the Stem Cell and Xenotransplantation Core Facility of the University of Pennsylvania or from the tissue collections of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute. Approval was obtained from the institutional review boards at the University of Pennsylvania (IRB protocol 703185) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute (IRB protocols 95–091 and 06–107), and informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All samples were collected after de-identification for these studies. For assessing clinical and genetic parameters of IDH1/2 wild-type and mutant AML, 78 serial samples from AML patients referred for molecular testing at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were examined. For 2HG assays, patient samples were obtained from the Stem Cell and Xenotransplantation Core Facility of the University of Pennsylvania. The initial 18 samples were selected from de-identified AML patients aged 50 years or older at diagnosis with lesions determined to have normal cytogenetic status. Cells used for these assays were prepared by Ficoll separation of mononuclear cells (MNCs) from peripheral blood or bone marrow. MNCs were frozen as viable cells in 10% DMSO. Student’s t test and Chi-square analysis were used to analyze data. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.  Sequence Analysis of IDH1 and IDH2  Genomic DNA was extracted from bone marrow mononuclear cells or from sorted leukemic cells; for samples with less than 70% blasts flow cytometric sorting (FACSAria) was used to isolate blast cells according to leukemic blast immunophenotype before DNA isolation. High-throughput DNA sequence analysis was used to screen for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. All DNA samples were whole genome amplified using Ø29 polymerase and mutations were validated on unamplified DNA to ensure all mutations were present in the diagnostic sample. Sequencing of IDH1 used primers which cover amino acid residues 41–138 (sense, 5’-TGTGTTGAGATGGACGCCTA-3’; antisense, 5’-GGTGTACTCAGAGCCTTCGC-3’). Sequencing of IDH2 used primers which cover amino acid residues 125–226 (sense, 5’-CTGCCTCTTTGTGGCCTAAG-3’; antisense, 5’-ATTCTGGTTGAAAGATGGCG-3’). Sequence analysis was performed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College PA) and all mutations were validated by repeat PCR and sequencing on unamplified DNA from the archival sample.  Structural modeling  Human IDH2 has 97% homology with pig IDH2, and none of the 13 residues that are different (out of 418 total, excluding the N-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence) are found in the active site. A PDB structure of pig IDH2 is available, with isocitrate in the active site (1LWD) (Ceccarelli et al., 2002). Based on the highly homologous pig structure, conservative structural models of human IDH2 were built with the CHARMM molecular mechanics package using the CHARMM27 force field. To model wild-type IDH2 with isocitrate, the 13 residues of 1LWD differing between pig and human were first changed to the human sequence. The side chains were then rebuilt, hydrogen atoms added to all residues, the substrate, active site Mn2+ ions, and conserved residues were restrained, and the structure minimized allowing only the changed residues to relax. For the α-ketoglutarate complexes, the substrate conformation/pose was first modeled on isocitrate by removing the β-carboxyl group and replacing it with a hydrogen. The wild-type IDH2-α-ketoglutarate complex was then minimized allowing only the active site residues (as defined in entry 1LWD) and substrate to relax. The R140Q mutant IDH2-α-ketoglutarate complex was subsequently modeled by changing arginine 140 to glutamine, and rebuilding the side chain. The structure was then minimized in two stages. First the mutated residue was allowed to relax, followed by a second relaxation of the active site residues, Mn2+, and substrate. All modeling images were generated using PyMOL Viewer (DeLano, 2002).  Constructing IDH1 and IDH2 mutants  The cDNA clone of human IDH2 (BC009244) was purchased from Invitrogen in pOTB7. Human IDH1 (BC012846.1) was purchased from ATCC in pCMV-Sport6. Standard site-directed mutagenesis techniques were used to generate IDH2 R172K by introducing a g515a change in the IDH2 open reading frame (ORF). IDH1 R132H was made by introducing a g395a base pair change in the IDH1 ORF. Wild-type and mutant sequences were then subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and confirmed by direct sequencing before expression in mammalian cells.  Cell culture, transfection, and metabolic labeling  293T cells and Bcl-xL-transfected SF188 cells (SF188) were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (CellGro). For expression of wild-type and mutant IDH1 and IDH2, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For IDH siRNA experiments, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMax, with oligonucleotides obtained from Sigma-Proligo. For metabolic labeling experiments, cells were cultured in glutamine-free DMEM supplemented with 4 mM [13C-U]-L-glutamine (Cambridge Isotope) for the 3h prior to metabolite extraction.  Cell lysate based enzyme assays  For IDH2 enzymatic assays, cells were lysed 48 h following transfection, using mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma). Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000g at 4 °C. Supernatants were then collected and normalized for total protein concentration. To measure IDH oxidative activity, 0.3 µg of lysate protein was added to 200 µl of an assay solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1.3 mM MnCl2, 0.33 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM β-NADP+, and 0.1 mM D-(+)-threo-isocitrate. The increase in 340 nm absorbance (OD340) as a measure of NADPH production was measured every 20 s for 30 min on a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Data are plotted as the mean activity of 3 replicates per lysate averaged among 5 time points centered at every 5 minutes. To measure IDH reductive activity, 3 µg of lysate protein was added to 200 µl of an assay solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.3 mM MnCl2, 0.01 mM β-NADPH, and 0.5 mM α-ketoglutarate. NADPH consumption was measured as the decrease in OD340, with 3 replicates per lysate. For all experiments, OD340 changes in assay buffer lacking lysate protein were measured and subsequently subtracted from the OD340 changes measured in lysate replicates to arrive at final values.  Western blot  To measure IDH2 levels in cell lysates used for enzymatic assays, aliquots of the same lysates used in activity measurements were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with IDH2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam, ab55271), and then detected with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare, NA931V). For assessing IDH knockdown in siRNA experiments, cells treated in parallel with those used for labeling or proliferative studies were lysed 48 h following transfection in standard RIPA buffer (1% NaDOC, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01 M Tris pH 8.0, 0.14 M NaCl), and then probed with IDH2 antibody as above, IDH1 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc49996), or IDH3A rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, ab58641). Actin antibody (Santa Cruz, sc1616) was also used to assess equal protein loading of Western blots.  Metabolite extraction  Cellular organic acids were extracted as previously described (Bennett et al., 2008). Briefly, after gentle removal of culture medium from proliferating cells, or freezing medium from frozen viable AML samples, cells were rapidly quenched with 80% methanol, chilled to −80°C, and then incubated at −80°C for 15 min. Extracts were subsequently transferred and centrifuged at 14,000g for 20 min. at 4°C. The organic acid pool in the supernatant was further purified by drying under nitrogen gas, redissolving in deionized water, and then elution from an AG-1 ×8 100–200 anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad) in 3 N HCl after washing with five column volumes. For media analysis, culture medium from transfected cells 24–48 h following transfection was collected and diluted five-fold with methanol. After centrifugation at 14,000g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated protein, supernatants were dried under nitrogen gas, and organic acids were purified as described above.  Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis  After drying the HCl eluate, samples were redissolved in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA; Regis) and heated for 1 h at 60°C to derivatize prior to GC-MS analysis. Samples were injected into an Agilent 7890A GC with an HP-5MS capillary column, connected to an Agilent 5975C Mass selective detector operating in splitless mode using electron impact ionization with ionizing voltage of −70 eV and electron multiplier set to 1060 V. GC temperature was started at 100 °C for 3 min, ramped to 230 °C at 4 °C/min and held for 4 min, then ramped to 300 °C and held for 5 min. Mass range of 50–500 amu was recorded at 2.71 scans/sec. Isotopic enrichment in citric acid was monitored using ions at m/e− 463 and 464 for citrate +4 and citrate +5 (containing 4 and 5 13C-enriched atoms, respectively), formed through loss of a t-butyl (−57 amu) and t-butyldimethylsilanol (−132 amu) from the molecular ion tetra-TBDMS-citric acid (648 amu). Isotopomer distributions were simultaneously corrected for naturally occurring heavy isotopes of all elements in each mass fragment using a correction matrix as previously described (Weckwerth, 2007). Identification of the 2HG metabolite peak was confirmed using standards obtained from Sigma. 2HG and glutamate signal intensities were quantified by integration of peak areas.  Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)  Organic acids from cellular extracts were purified as described above, followed by evaporation to dryness under nitrogen. After redissolving samples in deionized water, citrate was detected on two different LC-MS approaches, both of which gave comparable results. In both cases, LC separation was by reversed phase chromatography using tributylamine as an ion pairing agent (Lu et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2007) with ionization by negative electrospray at 23 kV. The first MS approach used a Thermo Discovery Max triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode, with citrate quantified using the reaction 191 → 87 at 20 eV. Additional reactions for every possible labeled form of citrate were also monitored using variations of the same transition. Reactions used to monitor other TCA components have been described previously (Bajad et al., 2006). The second MS approach used a Thermo Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer operated at 100,000 mass resolving power, with citrate and its isotope-labeled forms quantified based on extracted ion chromatograms at their exact masses.  SIGNIFICANCE  Most cancer-associated enzyme mutations result in either catalytic inactivation or constitutive activation. Here we report that the common feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations observed in AML and glioma is the acquisition of an enzymatic activity not shared by either wild-type enzyme. The product of this neomorphic enzyme activity can be readily detected in tumor samples and we show that tumor metabolite analysis can identify patients with tumor-associated IDH mutations. Using this method, we discovered a 2HG-producing IDH2 mutation, IDH2 R140Q, that was present in 9% of serial AML samples. Overall, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were observed in over 23% of AML patients.  HIGHLIGHTS  All IDH mutations reported in cancer share a common neomorphic enzymatic activity. Both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 are required for cell proliferation. IDH2 R140Q mutations occur in 9% of AML cases. Overall, IDH2 mutations appear more common than IDH1 mutations in AML.  Mutations in Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 are among the most common genetic alterations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC), a deadly liver cancer1–5. Mutant IDH proteins in IHCC and other malignancies acquire an abnormal enzymatic activity allowing them to convert alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which inhibits the activity of multiple αKG-dependent dioxygenases, and results in alterations in cell differentiation, survival, and extracellular matrix maturation6–10. However, the molecular pathways by which IDH mutations lead to tumour formation remain unclear. Here we show that mutant IDH blocks liver progenitor cells from undergoing hepatocyte differentiation through the production of 2HG and suppression of HNF4α, a master regulator of hepatocyte identity and quiescence. Correspondingly, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) expressing mutant IDH in the adult liver show aberrant response to hepatic injury, characterized by HNF4α silencing, impaired hepatocyte differentiation and markedly elevated levels of cell proliferation. Moreover, mutant IDH and activated Kras, genetic alterations that co-exist in a subset of human IHCCs4,5, cooperate to drive the expansion of liver progenitor cells, development of premalignant biliary lesions, and progression to metastatic IHCC. These studies provide a functional link between IDH mutations, hepatic cell fate, and IHCC pathogenesis, and present a novel GEMM of IDH-driven malignancy.  Gain-of-function IDH1/IDH2 mutations occur in ∼25% of IHCCs1,3–5 but have not been identified in hepatocellular carcinomas (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) — liver malignancies that exhibit bile duct and hepatocyte differentiation, respectively. To examine the role of IDH mutations in liver tumourigenesis we isolated mouse hepatoblasts (HBs), which are embryonic progenitors that give rise to hepatocytes and bile duct cells and show correspondence to adult liver progenitors11,12. HBs expressing mutant IDH1 (R132C, R132H) or IDH2 (R140Q, R172K) produced increased 2HG, but exhibited morphology and proliferation rates indistinguishable from vector and IDH wild type (WT) controls (Extended Data Fig. 1a–d). However, unlike control HBs, which underwent hepatocyte differentiation when transferred from collagen-coated plates to uncoated plates13, forming hepatocyte clusters, decreasing proliferation, and activating a large program of hepatocyte-specific genes including Adh1 and Aldob, IDH mutant cells were refractory to differentiation (Fig. 1a–d, Extended Data Fig. 1e–g). IDH1-R132C and IDH2-R172K caused the most pronounced effects, correlating with relative 2HG levels. Treatment of R132C-expressing HBs with ML309 (AGI-5027), a specific inhibitor of mutant IDH114, attenuated 2HG production (Extended Data Fig. 1h) and restored hepatocyte differentiation (Fig. 1e–f). Conversely, differentiation of WT HBs was counteracted by (R)- or (S)-2HG octyl-esters (Extended Data Fig. 1i–j). In contrast to the complete inhibition of hepatocyte differentiation, mutant IDH did not impair biliary differentiation of HBs in matrigel (Fig. 1g, Extended Data Fig. 1k–l). Thus, mutant IDH specifically blocks hepatocyte lineage progression through 2HG production.  Figure 1 Figure 1 IDH mutant alleles block hepatocyte differentiation To uncover the molecular program underlying these defects, we examined the effect of mutant IDH1/2 on the transcriptome of HBs grown on collagen. Transcriptional profiles of mutant IDH 1 and 2 clustered together and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) demonstrated reduced expression of targets of HNF4α — a master transcriptional regulator of hepatocyte differentiation12 — and of HNF1α which acts downstream of HNF4α15. Moreover, canonical HNF4α and HNF1α binding sites were strongly enriched at the promoters of differentially expressed genes (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a–c).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Mutant IDH blocks hepatocyte differentiation by silencing HNF4α HNF4α has multiple isoforms expressed from separate promoters. The P2 promoter (encoding Hnf4a7-9) is active in hepatoblasts and gradually extinguished in adult hepatocytes, whereas the P1 promoter (encoding Hnf4a1-6) is hepatocyte-specific16. Hnf4a7-9 mRNA and protein were reduced in IDH-mutant HBs, as was expression of HNF4α targets (Extended Data Fig. 2d–g). Moreover, under hepatocyte differentiation conditions, mutant IDH completely inhibited the pronounced induction of HNF4α1-6 and its target OCLN that is observed in control cells (Fig. 2b–c, Extended Data Fig. 2h). Mutant IDH or octyl-2HG treatment blocked Hnf4a1-6 mRNA induction, whereas AGI-5027 restored Hnfa1-6 levels in R132C-expressing cells (Extended Data Fig. 2i–k). Histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4Me3) is associated with active transcription and was specifically reduced at the P1 promoter in R132C HBs, consistent with the observed silencing of Hnf4a1-6, whereas the repressive marks, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, were unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 2l–m and data not shown). Significantly, HNF4α knockdown impaired hepatocyte differentiation of WT HBs without inhibiting biliary differentiation, whereas ectopic HNF4α expression rescued differentiation of IDH-mutant cells (Fig. 2d–h, Extended Data Fig. 2n–o, 3a–b). Thus, mutant IDH alters the epigenetic state of the P1 promoter — through targeting either direct regulators of the locus or more upstream factors — and prevents induction Hnf4a1-6, thereby blocking hepatocyte lineage progression. Notably, HNF4α and HNF1α have critical anti-proliferative and tumour suppressor functions in the adult liver17–20, suggesting the relevance of this pathway to mutant IDH-mediated tumourigenesis and prompting us to extend our studies in vivo.  We generated transgenic mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of IDH2-R140Q or IDH2-R172K (Tet-R140Q, Tet-R172K strains) specifically in adult hepatocytes — R140Q was detected in virtually all hepatocytes and R172K showed more scattered expression, and liver 2HG levels were elevated (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d, ,5a).5a). Since mutant IDH blocks liver progenitors from undergoing hepatocyte differentiation in vitro, we sought to address whether it acts analogously in vivo to specifically override differentiation from a progenitor cell state, or conversely, whether it broadly alters homeostasis of mature hepatocytes. Although normally quiescent, the liver has extensive regenerative capacity following injury involving replication of mature hepatocyte and biliary cells, or activation of bipotential progenitors (oval cells) that may arise from either lineage11,21. In the absence of injury, Tet-R140Q mice were healthy up to 48 weeks, and had normal liver histology, marker expression, proliferation, and liver function (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 5b, and data not shown). By contrast, pronounced defects in restoration of hepatocyte differentiation were observed in mice fed a diet containing 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidin (DDC) for 5 days then switched to normal diet for 3 weeks (Fig. 3a), a protocol causing hepatocyte cell death and transient oval cell activation21,22. Hepatocyte markers including HNF4α were downregulated 3–10-fold, while biliary markers were unchanged, and proliferation was increased >40-fold relative to WT controls (Fig. 3b–d). Despite this depletion of mature hepatocytes, no changes were seen in parameters of liver function (Extended Data Fig. 5c–d and data not shown), consistent with the persistence of hepatocytes surviving short-term DDC treatment and the established capacity of reduced hepatocyte numbers to maintain normal physiology.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Mutant IDH inhibits hepatocyte differentiation and quiescence of liver progenitors Serial analyses of WT and R140Q livers revealed comparable numbers of proliferating periductal HNF4α−/CK19− oval cells at 1 week, and resolution of this population after 3 weeks (Extended Data Fig. 6a–b, and Fig. 3e–f). However, R140Q livers exhibited prominent induction of proliferating non-periductal cells with hepatocyte morphology but reduced or absent HNF4α expression (HNF4α+ and HNF4α−/CK19−), which persisted after 3 weeks (Fig. 3e–f, Extended Data Fig. 6a–d). Similar but more tempered phenotypes were seen in Tet-R172K mice, consistent with focal transgene expression (Extended Data Fig. 6e–f). Thus, mutant IDH specifically blocks restoration of hepatocyte differentiation following acute liver injury, leading to aberrant proliferation in the hepatic parenchyma. As HNF4α levels increase in liver progenitors undergoing hepatocyte commitment23,24, these proliferating HNF4α-low/absent cells appear to be committed progenitors (derived from de-differentiated hepatocytes or oval cells) whose differentiation to hepatocytes is subverted by mutant IDH2. The transgene was not expressed in Sox9+ oval cells, precluding assessment of effects on these earlier progenitors.  We developed an additional transgenic strain (LSL-R172K) expressing human IDH2-R172K in Sox9+ biliary cells but not in hepatocytes (Fig. 3g, Extended Data Fig. 7a–b). These animals displayed normal liver histology, gene expression, and proliferation at 3 months (Extended Data Fig. 7c and data not shown). However, by 20 months of age there was pronounced accumulation of Hnf4α−/Sox9+ oval cells expressing R172K >25µm away from any bile duct or portal structure (zones 2/3) (Fig. 3g). Collectively, our results suggest that mutant IDH2 abrogates differentiation of adult progenitors (activated spontaneously during aging or by injury), specifically blocking hepatocyte lineage progression.  These findings are concordant with our observations in HB cells and suggest that failed HNF4α induction could contribute to the liver phenotypes caused by mutant IDH in vivo. In this regard, acute HNF4α deletion in hepatocytes is reported to provoke hepatocyte differentiation defects and, upon diethylnitrosamine (DEN) treatment, oval cell accumulation and formation of tumours showing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and IHCC morphology20. To expand upon potential parallels with IDH-mutant mice, we characterized these phenotypes in further depth. Significantly, the HCC lesions in DEN-treated HNF4a conditional KO mice were uniformly HNF4α+, indicating that they arose from cells that escaped deletion of the locus (Extended Data Fig. 8a). By contrast, Sox9+ oval cells and CK19+ IHCCs were HNF4α-negative and were never observed in DEN-treated controls (Extended Data Fig. 8b–c). Thus, HNF4α ablation in DEN-treated livers drives progenitor expansion and progression specifically to IHCC. These findings establish Hnf4a as an IHCC tumor suppressor and are consistent with HNF4α acting downstream of mutant IDH in liver growth control.  The capacity of mutant IDH to silence Hnf4a and impair differentiation would be expected to confer sensitivity to transformation by additional oncogenic lesions. In this regard, IDH and KRAS mutations exist concurrently in human IHCC4,5 and AML25. Previously, we showed that KrasG12D expression in mouse liver causes mixed IHCC/HCC with long latency, a phenotype accelerated by p53 deletion26. Intercrossing LSL-R172K, KrasG12D and Alb-Cre mice revealed dramatic oncogenic cooperation, with 6/6 Alb-Cre; LSL-R172K; KrasG12D animals developing poor body condition and palpable liver tumours between 33 and 58 weeks (mean 47.3 weeks; Fig. 4a). Multifocal liver masses with splenic invasion and peritoneal metastases were observed and demonstrated to be IHCC by histopathologic analysis, CK19 staining, and lack of reactivity for the hepatocyte/HCC marker, Hep Par1 (Fig. 4b). By contrast, only 1/7 Alb-Cre; KrasG12D mice sustained a tumour by 70 weeks (mean survival = 81.6 weeks), and solely HCC were detected (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Tumour 2HG levels in R172K mice were comparable to those in IDH-mutant human IHCC1 (Extended Data Fig. 8e).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Mutant IDH cooperates with KrasG12D to drive liver progenitor cell expansion and multi-step IHCC pathogenesis In humans, IHCC is thought to develop from precursor lesions, including biliary intraepithelial neoplasias (BilIN)2. Aberrant oval cell proliferation also precedes liver cancer development in murine models27. Notably, in all Alb-Cre; LSL-R172K; KrasG12D mice analyzed (N=6), the adjacent liver exhibited oval cell expansion and a graded series of BilIN-like lesions, which were Sox9+/CK19+, and expressed the IDH2-R172K transgene at physiologic levels (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 9a–b, 10a). Importantly, neither Alb-Cre; KrasG12D nor Alb-Cre; KrasG12D; p53Lox/+ livers26 showed oval cell expansion, and BilIN were found in only 2/8 Alb-Cre; KrasG12D; p53Lox/+ mice. Thus, IDH2-R172K and KrasG12D cooperatively incite activation of hepatic progenitors and multistage IHCC progression.  In summary, we present a novel GEMM driven by mutant IDH that exhibits the hallmarks of human IHCC. Mutant IDH blocks hepatocyte differentiation from progenitors in vitro, and regulates hepatic regeneration, progenitor cell expansion, and IHCC pathogenesis in vivo. Collectively, our findings are consistent with a model whereby mutant IDH subverts the HNF4α-mediated hepatocyte differentiation/quiescence program in proliferating hepatocytes or bipotential progenitors, creating a persistent pre-neoplastic state primed for transformation by additional oncogenic mutations, and leading to adenocarcinoma specifically with a biliary phenotype (Fig. 4d). While lineage-tracing studies are required to fully define the impact of IDH mutations on different liver cell types, this model predicts that IDH-mutant IHCC may have progenitor-like features, and that IDH mutations occur early in disease pathogenesis as observed in glioblastoma and AML28,29. Accordingly GSEA revealed that IDH-mutant tumors have strong enrichment of a hepatic stem cell expression signature (Extended Data Fig. 10b).  Defining the biologic functions of mutant IDH is of immediate significance as IHCCs are resistant to current treatment. Our GEMM provides an autochthonous context for ‘co-clinical trials’ to help determine the best way to deploy IDH inhibitors and identify biomarkers of response, thereby informing clinical decision-making in this deadly disease.  Go to: METHODS SUMMARY Cell culture  HB cells were prepared from WT mice at embryonic day 14 and subjected to hepatocyte and bile duct differentiation as described13. For proliferation assays, cells were plated in duplicate on collagen-coated or uncoated 6 well plates. Cells were trypsinized and counted by trypan-blue exclusion.  Mice  Mice were housed in pathogen-free animal facilities. Studies were approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care at Mass. General Hospital (protocol 2005N000148). The Tet-R140Q, Tet-R172K, and LSL-R172K transgenic mice and other strains are presented in the Methods Section. For DDC experiments, mice were maintained on 200 µg/mL doxycycline-containing water. Mice were fed with 0.1% DDC-containing chow (F4643, Bio-serv, Frenchtown, NJ) from days 2–7. Mice were then switched to normal chow until harvest. DEN experiments were performed as described20.  Statistics  Results are expressed as mean ±s.d. unless otherwise specified. Significance was analyzed using 2-tailed Student’s t test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Go to: METHODS Cell culture  HB cells were prepared from WT mice at embryonic day 14 and immortalized by plating at clonal density13. HBs were maintained in HB media [DMEM/F-12 (Gibco Life Technologies, Grand Island NY) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 50ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 30 ng/mL insulin-like growth factor II (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 10 µg/mL insulin (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)] on plates coated with rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C. For IDH1 experiments, culture media was supplemented with 25 ng/mL of doxycycline (d9891, Sigma-Aldrich). For hepatocyte differentiation assays, 5×106 HB cells were cultured on uncoated 10 cm tissue culture dishes in HB cell medium for up to 5 days. Pictures were taken 2–5 days after plating. For bile duct differentiation (matrigel) assays, 0.5 mL of Basement Membrane Matrix (BD) was coated onto 6 cm tissue culture dishes and allowed to set for 1h. Then 0.5×106 HB cells were added to the plate in HB cell media supplemented with 100 ng/mL recombinant mouse hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Tubules were counted after 24hrs. For gene expression analysis, cells were isolated after 10 days. For proliferation assays, cells were plated in duplicate on collagen-coated 6 well dishes (1×104/well) or uncoated 6 well plates (1×105/well) in culture medium. Adherent and non-adherent cells were harvested, trypsinized and counted by trypan-blue exclusion using a Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen) 24, 72 or 120 hrs later. Negative mycoplasma contamination status of all cell lines and primary cells used in the study was established using LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Kit (Sigma, MP0035).  AGI-5027  AGI-5027 (ML309) is a small molecule (phenyl-glycine scaffold) inhibitor of IDH1 R132C and R132H (IC50=30 nm and 68 nm respectively) that does not affect WT IDH1 activity (IC50 >36 µM and was developed by NIH Chemical Genomics Center and Agios Pharmaceuticals14.  Mice  Mice were housed in pathogen-free animal facilities. All experiments were conducted under protocol 2005N000148 approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care at Massachusetts General Hospital. Mice were maintained on mixed 129SV/C57Bl/6 background. Data presented include both male and female mice. All mice included in the survival analysis were euthanized when criteria for disease burden were reached.  Albumin-Cre transgenic mice This strain30 harbors a transgene in which the mouse albumin enhancer/promoter drives Cre recombinase. Cre activity is inefficient at birth, but leads to progressive deletion of floxed sequences in all liver lineages by 4–6 weeks of age.  Rosa26-LSL-rtTA31 mice In this strain, the doxycycline-responsive reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) is knocked into the transcriptional start site at the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 locus and is preceded by a lox-stop-lox (LSL) casette.  KrasG12D mice32 This allele consists of a mutant KrasG12D allele knocked into the endogenous Kras locus, preceded by an LSL cassette.  IDH mutant transgenic mouse models To generate transgenic mice, the R140Q and R172K mutations were introduced into human IDH2 cDNA (Origene, Rockville, MD # SC319226, accession# NM_002168) using the Quickchange kit (Agilent Lexington, MA #200521) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Two different transgenic targeting approaches were used.  Doxycycline inducible models To generate the doxycycline-inducible Tet-R140Q and Tet-R172K strains (Extended Data Fig. 4), IDH2-R140Q cDNA was cloned into the pBS31 Prime transgenic targeting vector (Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems, #MES4487). A modified version of pBS31 containing a floxed stop cassette was used for the IDH2-R172K mice. The targeting vectors were co-electroporated into C2 mouse embryonic stem cells (Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems, #MES4305) with a plasmid expressing FLPE recombinase (pCAGGS-FlpE, Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems, Waltham MA, #MES4488) as described33. This system involves single copy integration of the transgene downstream of the Collagen-1 locus, and within the liver, results in expression in hepatocytes but not in bile ducts33. ES cells were screened for integration of the transgene by PCR and correctly targeted ES cells were injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts. Chimeras were crossed to the Albumin-Cre strain30, and offspring were successively crossed with Rosa26-LSL-rtTA31, and LSL-KrasG12D mice32. We confirmed the expected expression of the R140Q (Extended Data Figure. 4b–c) and R172K transgenes (Extended Data Fig. 4d) in the adult hepatocytes and lack of expression in bile ducts. Stably expressed model: To generate mice with a conditionally active IDH2-R172K allele (LSL-R172K), human IDH2-R172K was cloned into a modified version of the PGK-ATG-Frt vector (Open Biosystems, Waltham MA, #MES4490) containing the CAGGS promoter for stable expression (Extended Data Fig 7a)34. Gene targeting and chimeric mouse generation was as above. This strain was successively crossed with Albumin-Cre and LSL-KrasG12D animals. This transgene was specifically expressed in bile ducts and oval cells (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 7b). We did not observe developmental anomalies in these mice, although the inefficiency of recombination induced by the Alb-Cre strain in neonates and the restricted activity of the transgene in this system precludes definitive assessment of potential effects of mutant IDH2 on the embryonic liver.  DDC treatment  For DDC experiments, 4-week old mice were treated with 200 µg/mL doxycycline-containing water. 2 days later, mice were fed with 0.1% DDC-containing chow (F4643, Bio-serv, Frenchtown, NJ) for 5 days. The mice were then switched to normal chow and maintained on doxycycline-containing water until harvest 1 or 3 weeks later. Randomization was done according to genotype and blinding was applied during histological analysis. No mice were excluded from the analysis. Sample sizes were chosen to achieve statistical significance yet use the fewest animals possible to minimize suffering.  Statistics  Results are expressed as mean ±s.d. between two technical replicates, unless otherwise specified. Significance was analyzed using 2-tailed Student’s t test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Plasmids  Human wild-type IDH1 cDNA (Accession# NM_005896) was obtained from Origene and subcloned into pRetro-Puro using EcoRI and BamHI fragments. Human wild-type IDH2, R140Q and R172K cDNA (Origene) were subcloned into pRetro-puro and pMSCV-blast (derived by replacing the puromycin resistance gene from pMSCV-puro with a blasticidin resistance gene) (both from Clontech, Mountain View CA) using EcoRI and XhoI. Human IDH1 R132C was generated from wild-type IDH1 using QuikChange Lightning kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and primers 5’-GATGGGTAAAACC TATCATCATAGGTTGTCATGCTTATGGGGATCAATAC-3’ for sense and 5’-GTATTGATCCCCATAAGCATGACAACCTATGATGATAGGTTTTACCCATC-3’ for antisense. pLVX-Tet-On was obtained from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Murine Hnf4a was obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA) and cloned into pRetro-blast (derived by replacing the puromycin resistance with blasticidin) as a BglII-EcoRI fragment. Lentiviral (pLKO.1) Hnf4α shRNA vectors TRCN0000026154, target sequence: 5’-CGACAATGTGTGGTAGACAAA-3’ and TRCN0000026216, target sequence: 5’-GCAGATTGATGACAATGAATA-3’ were used as shHnf4a#1 and shHnf4a#2, respectively, and were obtained from the Broad Institute TRC shRNA library. pLKO.1 shRNA with target sequence 5’-GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCAT-3’ was used as negative control shRNA. Hnf4α resistant to shHnf4a#2 was generated using QuikChange Lightning kit and primers 5’-GCCCTTCCAAGAGCTGCAGA TCGACGATAACGAATATGCCTGCCTCAAAGCC-3’ for sense and 5’-GGCTTTGAGGCAGGCATATTCGTTATCGTCGATCTGCAGCTCTTGGAAGGGC-3’ for antisense.  Immunoblot analysis  Cell extracts were prepared in 1x RIPA buffer (150mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1%SDS, 50mM Tris, 0.5% DOC) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Sets I and II, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and quantified by BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). 30 µg protein was resolved on 9% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% non-fat milk and 0.1% Tween and probed with anti-IDH1 polyclonal antibody (3997S, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-IDH2 polyclonal antibody (ab84726, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-occludin (71-1500, Invitrogen), anti-HNF4α (1-6) monoclonal antibody (ab41898, Abcam), anti-HNF4α(1–6)/NP2A1 monoclonal antibody (PP-K9218-00, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-HNF4α(7–9) monoclonal antibody (PP-H6939-00, R&D Systems), or anti-βactin monoclonal antibody (A5316, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as loading control. Bound proteins were detected with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Biolaboratories, Burlingame, CA) and SuperSignal West Pico Luminol/Enhancer Solution (Thermo Scientific).  RNA analysis  Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA synthesis was performed with the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) with 1µg total RNA. Sense and antisense for amplification of target genes included: Alb (5’-CATGCCAAATTAGTGCAGGA-3’ and 5’-GCTGGGGTTGTCATCTTTGT-3’); Aldob (5’-TGTCTGGAGGTATGAGTGAGG-3’ and 5’-CTGGGTTGCCTTCTTGTTTGC-3’); Adh1 (5’-GTGACTTGTGTGAAACCAGGT-3’ and 5’-GCTACAAAAGTTGCTTTCCGGG-3’); Ggt1 (5’-CTTGTGCGAGGTGTTCTGC-3’ and 5’-GCATAGTCACCGTCTCTCCTT-3’); Bgp (5’-CAAAAGGAGGCCTCTCAGAT-3’ and 5’-GCTGAGGGTTTGTGCTCTGT-3’); Hnf4α(1–6) (5’-GGTAGGGGAGAATGCGACTC-3’ and 5’-AAACTCCAGGGTGGTGTAGG-3’); Foxm1 (5’-ATCGCTACTTGACATTGGACCA-3’ and 5’-GATTGGGTCGTTTCTGCTGTG-3’); Krt19 (5’-TGCTGGATGAGCTGACTCTG-3’ and 5’-AATCCACCTCCACACTGACC-3’); Onecut1 (5’-GGCAACGTGAGCGGTAGTTT-3’ and 5’-TTGCTGGGAGTTGTGAATGCT-3’); Arg1 (5’-TTGGGTGGATGCTCACACTG-3’ and 5’-GTACACGATGTCTTTGGCAGA-3’); C2 (5’-GGAACCCATTTGCCGACAG-3’ and 5’-GGCCCAAACTTTTTGTCAGAAG-3’); C7 (5’-GCAGGAAAGTGTTCAGCGG-3’ and 5’-CATGACCGTAAGTATTCCGTGAG-3’); C9 (5’-CATGCCGTGACCGAGTAGC-3’ and 5’-TCACAGAGTCCGTTGTAGAACT-3’); Krt7 (5’-CACCCGGAATGAGATTGCG-3’ and 5’-GCACGCTGGTTCTTCAAGGT-3’); Sprr1a (5’-TTGTGCCCCCAAAACCAAG-3’ and 5’-GGCTCTGGTGCCTTAGGTTG-3’); Ttr (5’-CACCAAATCGTACTGGAAGACA-3’ and 5’-GTCGTTGGCTGTGAAAACCAC-3’); ApoB (5’-TGGCTCTGATCCCAAATCCCT-3’ and 5’-GCTGCTCCTTGGCAGTATTAAA-3’); Cyp3a13 (5’-GACCACAAGCAGTGCTCTTTC-3’ and 5’-GCAGGGTATCATAGGTGGCAG-3’).  Gene expression profiling and gene-set enrichment analysis  Gene expression of HBs expressing IDH1 WT, IDH1 R132C, IDH2 WT, R172K and empty vector controls (N=2 cultures for each condition) grown on collagen-coated plates, as well as IDH1 R132C and empty vector controls grown on uncoated plates, was evaluated using Affymetrix Mouse 430Av2 DNA microarrays (DFCI Microarray core facility). Raw expression values were processed and normalized using RMA in the R Bioconductor package. This dataset is available in GEO (GSE57002). Differentially expressed genes in IDH1 R132C and IDH2 R172K expressing HBs were identified using the signal-to-noise metric. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the expression data was used to uncover the molecular program accounting for the differentiation defects. GSEA was performed using two libraries from version 3.1 of the molecular signature database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp): the c2 curated gene sets from online pathway databases, PubMed publications, knowledge of domain experts and the c3 motif gene sets. Pairwise GSEA analysis such as shown in Fig. 2a was performed by creating ranked lists of genes using the log2 ratio of mutant IDH samples to vector or WT control and running GSEA in the ranked list mode. The heat map in Fig. 2a presents the gene-sets that distinguish IDH1 R132C or IDH2 R172K as compared to cells expressing WT IDH1 or IDH2 or EV. Each column represents pairwise analysis of HB cells expressing mutant IDH (IDH1 R132C or IDH2 R172K) with either EV (left columns) or WT IDH (right columns) control cells for two independent replicates of each sample. All other results were obtained using GSEA to rank genes according to signal-to-noise ratio between mutant IDH samples and controls. Statistical significance for GSEA results were obtained from permuting gene sets (1000 permutations). Gene sets of ‘Hepatocyte Genes’ for the GSEA results shown in Extended Data Fig. 1g were created from expression data from Shin, et al. 201137. The expression data was downloaded from GEO (GSE28891) in series matrix form and loaded into R. Undifferentiated, differentiated hepatocytes, and primary hepatocyte samples were selected from GSE28891 (4 samples of each type for a total of 12). Within that sample subset, the normalized signal intensities were thresholded to a minimum value of 10 and features were filtered out if they had less than 3 fold difference between minimum and maximum values or had absolute differences less than 50 between minimum and maximum values (leaving 21277 features out of 37908). A t-test was performed between the undifferentiated and the combined differentiated and primary hepatocyte samples and p-values from the t-test were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (in R using the Bioconductor multtest package). This left 206 features up and 407 down in the hepatocyte direction with an adjusted BH p-value < 0.01 which are represented by 133 and 311 unique gene symbols respectively. 96 of these genes were represented on the murine Affymetrix array. The feature list was made into a gene set labeled as ‘Hepatocyte Genes’ and is shown in Supplementary Table 1.  Chromatin Immunoprecipitation  5×106 EV, IDH1 WT or R132C-expressing HBs were transferred from collagen-coated to uncoated plates for 5 days and fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at 37°C. Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of glycine at a final concentration of 125mM for 5min. Cells were then harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Chromatin extraction, DNA sonication, and immunoprecipitation were performed using a Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay Kit (17-295, Millipore, Temecula, CA) and ChIPAb+ Trimethyl-Histone H3 (Lys4) (17-614, Millipore) or Tri-Methyl-Histone H3 (Lys4) Antibody (Cell Signaling, #9727S) validated antibody. Sense and antisense for amplification of target genomic regions included: Hhex (5’-GAAGGAGCCTGACCCTTTCC-3’ and 5’-ATCAGCAGCGTGCACTACTC-3’); Hoxa10 (5’-AACAGTAAAGCTTCGCCGGA-3’ and 5’-AGTTCAGAAGGTCAGCCTGC-3’); Hnf4a P1 (5’-AACATGGCCCTATCTTCGGG-3’ and 5’-AAACGCACACCGCTATGTTG-3’).  Histology and Immunostaining  Tissue samples were fixed overnight in 4% buffered formaldehyde, and then embedded in paraffin and sectioned (5 µm thickness) by the DF/HCC Research Pathology Core. Hematoxylin & eosin staining was performed using standard methods. For immunohistochemistry, unstained slides were baked at 55°C overnight, deparaffinized in xylenes (2 treatments, 6 min each), rehydrated sequentially in ethanol (5 min in 100%, 3 min in 95%, 3 min in 75%, and 3 min in 40%), and washed for 5 min in 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS (PBST) and 3 min in water. For antigen unmasking, specimens were cooked in a 2100 Antigen Retriever (Aptum Biologics Ltd, Southampton, UK) in 1X Antigen Unmasking Solution, Citric Acid Based (H-3300, Vector Laboratories), rinsed 3 times with PBST, incubated for 10 min with 1% H2O2 at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase activity, washed 3 times with PBST, and blocked with 5% goat serum in PBST for 1h. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution as follows: anti-R172K (26163, New East Biosciences) 1:100, anti-R140Q (26165 New East Biosciences) 1:100, anti-IDH2 (NBP2-22166, Novus Biologicals) 1:100, anti-HNF4α monoclonal antibody (PP-K9218-00, R&D Systems) 1:250, anti-CK19 (Troma3) 1:100; anti-Sox9 (ab5535, Millipore), 1:300; or anti-Ki67 (ab15580, Abcam), 1:100 and incubated with the tissue sections at 4°C overnight. Specimens were then washed 3 times for 3 min each in PBST and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) in blocking solution for 1h at room temperature. Then, specimens were washed 3 times in PBST and treated with ABC reagent (Vectastain ABC kit #PK-6100) for 30 min, followed by 3 washes for 3 min each. Finally, slides were stained for peroxidase for 3 min with the DAB (Di-amine-benzidine) substrate kit (SK-4100, Vector Laboratories), washed with water and counterstained with hematoxylin. Stained slides were photographed with an Olympus DP72 microscope. For Immunofluorescence studies of tissue specimens, antigen unmasking was performed in 1X Antigen Retrieval Buffer, Tris-EDTA Buffer, pH 9.0 (ab93684, Abcam), rinsed briefly with dH2O, washed for 5min in PBS, followed by 5 min in 0.05% Tween-20/TBS (TBST). Specimens were then blocked using 0.5% blocking reagent (FP1020, PerkinElmer) diluted in TBS (TNB) for 1h and incubated in primary antibodies at 4°C overnight in TNB, followed by 3 min washes in TBST and 1h incubation in secondary antibodies (1:400) diluted in TNB. Finally, specimens were rinsed 3 × 5 min in TBST and mounted using mounting media with DAPI (H-1500, Vectashield Vector Laboratories). For cell culture staining, samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 20 min followed by washing four times in PBS. Residual paraformaldehyde was removed with three 5-min washes with 100 mM glycine in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS and blocked for 30 min with blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, PBS). Coverslips were incubated with primary (1:100) and secondary (1:1000) antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h and 40 min, respectively, at room temperature, and nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Coverslips were mounted with immu-mount (Thermo-Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Sox9 (1:500; Millipore AB5535); goat anti-HNF4α (SC6556, 1:250; Santa Cruz). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa-488, 555 or 647 (Life Technologies). Confocal images were captured by a scanning laser confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti; Nikon) using 40× or 60× oil lenses and captured using NIS-Elements software (Nikon). Images were processed using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop CS4. For quantification of signal intensity ratios, channel intensities of individual cells were selected from at least 60 cells per sample from at 3- 5 images using the Measure RGB plugin of ImageJ and exported into Excel for further analysis.  2HG production and measurement  2HG-octyl esters were prepared from commercially available 2HG lactones (CAS# 21461-84-7 (S-) and 53558-93-3 (R-)). Esterification of lactone with 1-octanol and EDCI (CAS# 25952-53-8), followed by opening of the lactone with lithium hydroxide in tetrahydrofuran/water, yielded the 2HG-octyl esters (free carboxylic acid) upon neutralization and chromatographic purification. The sodium salts of both 2HG-octyl esters are available from Toronto Research Chemicals. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using an AB Sciex 4000 (Framingham, MA) operating in negative electrospray mode. MRM data were acquired for each compound using the following transitions: 2HG (146.9/128.8 amu), 13C5-2HG (151.9/133.8 amu) and 3HMG (160.9/98.9 amu). Chromatographic separation was performed using an ion-exchange column (Bio-Rad Fast Acid Analysis, 9µm, 7.8 mm X 100 mm; Bio-Rad). The flow rate was 1ml/min of 0.1 % formic acid in water with a total run time of 4 minutes. Samples were prepared as follows: Tissues were weighed out and homogenized in appropriate volumes of PBS using Tissue Lyser (Qiagen). 10µl of homogenate were extracted by adding 200µl of methanol with 200 ng/ml 3HMG as internal standard. Cell pellets containing 1×106 cells each were resuspended in specified volumes of 80:20 MeOH:water, centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000 rpm. 30µl of supernatant were extracted by adding 170µl of methanol with 200 ng/ml 13C5-2HG as internal standard. All sample types were then vortexed, centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 5°C and 150µl of supernatant transferred to a clean 96-well plate. The samples were dried down and reconstituted in 200µl 0.1% formic acid in water, and 10 µl injected on a column.  Human samples and genomic studies  An initial cohort of 149 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples was obtained from ICC patients resected between 1995 and 2007 at three centers from the HCC Genomic Consortium: IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori (Milan), Mount Sinai School of Medicine (New York), and Hospital Clinic (Barcelona). Pathological diagnosis of ICC was confirmed by two independent liver pathologists (MS and ST). DNA and RNA extraction from human tissue, whole-genome gene-expression profiling (DASL assay Illumina), and the Infinium FFPE restoration kit (Illumina) are extensively described elsewhere36. The study protocol was approved at each center’s Institutional Review Board. A total of 127 samples had available data for both gene expression and DNA copy number changes and were analyzed for molecular characterization to define molecular-based classes. IDH1 and 2 mutations occurring at Arginine residue 132 and 172 respectively were analyzed by PCR technique using primers 5’-GTGGCACGGTCTTCAGAGA-3’ (forward primer) and 5’- TGCTTAATGGGTGTAGATACCAA-3’ (reverse primer), and 5’-GCCCACACATTTGCACTCTA-3’ (forward primer) and 5’-AAGGAAAGCCACGAGACAGA-3’ (reverse primer). The PCR amplifications were performed in a volume of 25µL reaction mixture containing 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.2mM of each dNTP, 0.125mM of each primer and 1U of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR products were purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 3700 DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM® 3730XL; Applied Biosystems). Good quality sanger sequencing data for both IDH1 and IDH2 was obtained for 107 ICC DNA samples and has been included in all the subsequent analyses.  Human Gene Set Enrichment Analysis  Genes, molecular pathways, and gene expression signatures associated with the classes were evaluated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for Molecular Signature Database gene sets (MSigDB, www.broadinstitute.org/msigdb). Data analysis was conducted using the GenePattern Analytical Toolkit37, whereas correlation with clinico-pathological parameters was performed with SPSS software® (version 18) as previously described36.

1852||Introduction  CTCF was originally identified as a ZF 3 protein that binds and represses the chicken and mammalian MYC promoters (1, 2, 3) . CTCF encodes a highly conserved, widely expressed transcription factor harboring 11 ZFs, which mediate binding to specific DNA sequences. CTCF target sites have been characterized in the promoters, insulators, and other regulatory regions of several genes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) , are unusually long (∼50 bp), and differ greatly in sequence. Remarkably, CTCF uses different subsets of its individual ZFs to bind these diverse regulatory sequences (3 , 5 , 11) . This multivalent nature of CTCF most likely underlies its remarkable versatility in regulating gene expression. Indeed, CTCF has been implicated in both promoter activation (4) and repression (1, 2, 3) , in hormone-responsive gene silencing (5 , 11) , and in methylation-dependent chromatin insulation and genomic imprinting (6, 7, 8, 9, 10) .  Given the diverse roles that CTCF plays in normal gene expression and its likely involvement in regulating the expression of several genes directly implicated in cancer, i.e., MYC, ARF, PIM1, PLK, and Igf2, we hypothesized that CTCF might undergo genetic alterations in some human cancers. This assumption was supported by the observation that CTCF maps within the smallest region of overlap for LOH that has been observed at chromosome 16q22.1 in breast, prostate, and Wilms’ tumors (12 , 13) .  In this report, we describe the first examples of the tumor-specific missense mutations in the ZF domain of CTCF identified in breast, prostate, and Wilms’ tumors. These mutations did not completely abrogate DNA-binding by CTCF. Rather, they selectively altered the spectrum of CTCF binding such that CTCF interaction with the promoters/insulators of genes involved in regulating cell proliferation (MYC, ARF, PIM1, PLK, and Igf2) was reduced severely, whereas CTCF binding to other loci, including the β-globin insulator, lysozyme silencer, or APP promoter, was unaffected. CTCF may represent a novel type of tumor suppressor gene, mutations of which display selective “change of function” rather than complete “loss of function” in contributing to the malignant phenotype.  Materials and Methods  Cloning the Human CTCF Genomic Locus.  A human fibroblast genomic DNA library (Stratagene) was screened by standard procedures with the probes harboring either 5′-untranslated region sequence or the full-length human CTCF cDNA (3) . Fourteen positive lambda clones were isolated, mapped, and ordered, and most of the exon-containing fragments were subcloned into the Bluescript II SK+ vector and sequenced. Each exon-intron boundary was determined by comparing the cDNA and genomic sequences.  Paired Normal/Tumor DNA Samples.  Prostate cancer DNA samples were obtained at the Department of Urology, School of Medicine Chiba University (Chiba, Japan). Wilms’ tumor DNA samples were obtained from the Department of Pediatrics, Cross Cancer Institute, (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) and the National Wilms’ Tumor Study Bank. Breast cancer samples were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Leiden University (Leiden, the Netherlands); from the Department of Clinical Genetics, Karolinska Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden); and from the Laboratoire de Génétique Moléculaire, Institut Bergonié (Bordeaux, France). Blood and tumor samples were obtained with the patient’s consent and the approval of the local ethics committee at each institution.  Protein Truncation Test.  The E1 exon that encodes the entire NH2-terminal domain of CTCF (Fig. 1A) ⇓ was PCR amplified from normal and tumor DNA samples with the 75-nucleotide-long forward primer 5′-gcgcaatTGTAATACGACTCACTATAgcgcAGGAGGgtttttaccATGgaaggtgaatgcagtcgaagccattgtg-3′ containing the T7 promoter (shown in bold), a ribosome-binding site (italic), a spacer followed by the complementary sequence to the beginning of the human CTCF cDNA open reading frame (underlined), a reverse primer at the end of the E1 exon sequence followed by the stop codons in three frames, and a poly(A) tail. Purified PCR products were used as DNA templates for [35S]Met-labeled protein synthesis with the TnT reticulocyte lysate coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega) and SDS-PAGE analyses as described (3 , 11) .

These analyses documented mutations in one breast tumor (K344E), one prostate tumor (H345R), and two Wilms’ tumors (R339W and R448Q). Each of the four mutations consisted of a single nucleotide substitution resulting in a missense codon that was not present in normal tissue controls (upper sequencing panels). Numbering on DNA sequences corresponds to a given sequencing reaction rather than to CTCF cDNA nucleotide numbering. The sequences are shown only for one strand, whereas both strands were sequenced. C, schematic drawing of the wild-type CTCF protein encoded by the human CTCF cDNA shows the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of CTCF and the DNA binding domain of CTCF composed of 10 C2H2-class and 1 C2HC-class ZFs. The enlarged diagrams indicate the tumor-specific CTCF missense mutations that result in amino acid substitutions within ZF3 and ZF7 at positions critical for DNA base recognition or ZF formation. SSCP Analysis.  SSCP analysis was performed as described (14) . The limited amounts of genomic DNA available were initially preamplified, and then long genomic CTCF fragments were used as templates for subsequent amplification of short exon-containing DNA fragments for SSCP analyses. Sequences of primers for PCR-SSCP are available in GenBank (see below). Aberrantly migrating DNA bands were gel purified and subjected to DNA sequencing. Each mutation found in a tumor sample was verified at least three times by repeating independent SSCP and direct sequencing with the original DNA sample to exclude any possibility of PCR-introduced artifacts.  LOH Analysis.  LOH of CTCF was determined by allele quantification using semiquantitative PCR analysis with 16q polymorphic markers localized telomeric and centromeric to the CTCF locus. 4 The reduction of the signal intensity of >50% was considered evidence for LOH (13 , 15, 16, 17, 18) .  Gel Mobility Shift Assay.  The 11-ZF DNA binding domain and full-length human CTCF proteins were synthesized from the pCITE-11ZF and the pCITE-7.1 constructs, respectively (3 , 11) , with the TnT reticulocyte lysate coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega). Site-specific mutagenesis in the pCITE-7.1 construct recreating each tumor-specific mutation in the full-length CTCF protein was carried out with the “Quick Change” site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Both the presence of the correctly mutated nucleotide in the resulting plasmids and the absence of any inadvertently introduced mutations in the ZF domain were determined by DNA sequencing. Twelve 120–200-bp-long DNA fragments containing previously identified different CTCF target sites that are listed in Fig. 2A ⇓ , were 32P-labeled, gel purified, and used as DNA probes for gel mobility shift assays with equal amounts of the in vitro translated CTCF proteins as described (3 , 11) . Binding reactions were carried out in the buffer containing standard PBS with 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% NP40, and 10% glycerol in the presence of poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid). Reaction mixtures of 20 μl of final volume were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then analyzed on 5% nondenaturing PAGE run in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer.  Fig. 2.

The DNA fragments harboring the CTCF target sites that are listed in A were 32P-labeled and used as probes. CTSs, CTCF target sites. The CTCF mutants are identified by abbreviations indicated at the top of each panel as KE (K344E), RW (R339W), HR (H345R), and RQ (R448Q). Reticulocyte TnT mixture (Promega) with no template for in vitro transcription-translation (Lanes Empty) and the 11 ZF domain protein (Lanes 11 ZF) were included in the DNA-binding reactions as negative and positive controls, respectively. The positions of the unbound (F), of the full-length CTCF-bound (B), and of the 11 ZF-bound (11ZF) DNA probes are indicated to the left of each panel. Summaries of the gel shift analyses are shown in a banner along the top of all panels. +, retention of the DNA binding activity by each mutant CTCF protein nearly equal to that of the wild-type protein; −, complete loss of DNA binding; +/−, retention of residual binding activity. These experiments showed that all mutations resulted in complete loss or severe reduction of CTCF binding to 9 of 12 targets analyzed while having no effect on binding to the other 3. The first group of targets included CTCF target sites in known growth-regulatory genes, MYC, PIM1, PLK, p19ARF, and Igf2/H19, and in the thyroid hormone receptor-responsive silencer element 144 of an unknown gene. The second group of sites, for which binding was unaffected by the mutations, comprised those found in β-globin, APP, and lysozyme genes. Quantitation of CTCF binding affinity to several CTCF sites by surface plasmon resonance as described earlier (9) showed that the ZF mutations did not noticeably reduce CTCF binding affinity for the β-globin site (1013-1012 m−1), whereas binding of the CTCF mutants to the Igf2/H19 sites was decreased severely from 1012 m−1 for the wild-type CTCF protein to 107-106 m−1 for K344E and R339W mutants and to undetectable levels for the R448Q and H345R mutants. Expression and Reporter Constructs and Transient Transfections.  The wild-type full-length CTCF expression vector, pCI-7.1, as well as the CTCF COOH-terminal expression vector, pCI-C, were described earlier (3) . The ZF-mutant versions of pCI-7.1 were prepared as described above for the site-specific mutagenesis in the pCITE-7.1. The reporter plasmids, containing the mouse p19ARF promoter, pGL2-ARFpro BamHI, and the human APPβ promoter, pCAT2b-APP, were described earlier (4 , 19) . Plasmids for transfections were isolated by the Endofree Maxi procedure (Qiagen). Transient cotransfection experiments were performed by the calcium phosphate method as described earlier (3) . CV-1 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg/plate of the reporter plasmid and 5 μg of either CTCF expression vector. The pHIV-LTR/β-gal construct that neither binds nor responds to CTCF was used for normalizing transfection efficiency as described earlier (3) . After 24 h, the cells were harvested and assayed for reporter activity normalized to that of the transfection efficiency control. Western analysis with an antibody against the COOH-terminal domain of CTCF (Upstate Biotechnology) indicated that the production of CTCF proteins of expected size was nearly equal for each expression vector (not shown). Three independent transfections were performed.  Database Accession Numbers.  The GenBank/EMBL database accession numbers for DNA sequences of CTCF exons E1 through E10, together with their flanking regions and indicated positions/sequences of the forward and reverse SSCP primers used for mutation detection, are AF145468 through AF145477, respectively.  Results and Discussion  We isolated previously the human CTCF cDNA (3) and used it as a probe to clone the human CTCF genomic locus. Fig. 1A ⇓ shows that the entire NH2 terminus of the CTCF protein is encoded by the exon E1, whereas the COOH-terminal domain is split between exons E9 and E10, and the 11 ZFs are distributed in exons E2 to E8 with several ZFs being split across neighboring exons. In comparison to the avian CTCF gene that consists of eight exons (20) , the human CTCF has 12 exons with the introns harboring a high density of different classes of Alu-repeats (described in the corresponding GenBank entries). The additional human CTCF introns, however, do not change the CTCF cDNA open reading frame, which is overall 93% conserved between avian and humans with 100% identity in the ZF domain (3) .  As detailed in “Materials and Methods,” we initially used the protein truncation assay to screen for tumor-specific mutations within the NH2-terminus encoding first exon of CTCF (Fig. 1A) ⇓ in paired normal-tumor DNA samples. These samples included 31 cases of sporadic breast cancer (15 , 16) , 40 prostate cancers (17) , and 59 Wilms’ tumors (18) . We did not identify any frameshift or truncating mutations at the CTCF NH2 terminus using this approach. However, in an analysis of the CTCF ZF domain using SSCP screening and DNA sequencing, we documented missense codon mutations in one breast tumor, two Wilms’ tumors, and a prostate tumor (Fig. 1B) ⇓ . These ZF mutations were tumor specific because corresponding normal peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA from each of these 4 individuals did not display such mutations. DNA samples from the tumors with ZF mutations were also examined for LOH with 16q polymorphic markers located centromeric and telomeric to CTCF (13 , 15, 16, 17, 18) . In the four tumors harboring CTCF mutations, each mutant allele was found associated with loss of the normal CTCF allele.  Mutations K344E, H345R, and R339W from breast, prostate and Wilms’ tumors, respectively, clustered in CTCF ZF3, whereas the other Wilms’ tumor mutation, R448Q, was in ZF7 (Fig. 1, B and C) ⇓ . The DNA binding domain of CTCF is composed of 10 C2H2-class and one C2HC-class ZFs (Fig. 1C) ⇓ . These types of ZFs insert into the major groove of DNA to make specific contacts with nucleotides by amino acids at positions −1, 2, 3, and 6 (21) . Both Wilms’ tumor mutations (the ZF3 R339W and the ZF7 R448Q), which eliminate the guanine-contacting arginines at positions 6 and −1, respectively, therefore likely represent amino acid changes critical for specific interaction with DNA (Fig. 1C) ⇓ . The H345R mutation in the prostate tumor likely disrupts the third ZF by eliminating the His residue critical for ZF formation (Fig. 1C) ⇓ . The adjacent amino acid is altered by K344E mutation in the breast tumor; a mutation at the identical site in the third ZF of the TFIIIA has been shown to result in a loss of function (22) . Thus, each of the four identified tumor-specific point mutations in the CTCF ZF domain result in a missense codon at a position predicted to be critical for ZF formation or DNA base recognition.  Previously, in our experiments with ZF deletions, we observed that CTCF uses different combinations of its 11 ZFs to bind to different CTCF target sequences (3 , 5 , 11) . To test whether the observed tumor-specific CTCF ZF point mutations altered the specificity of CTCF binding to different targets, wild-type and mutant full-length CTCF proteins were synthesized and analyzed by gel mobility shift assay for binding to the 12 CTCF target sites presented in Fig. 2A ⇓ . Fig. 2B ⇓ shows that the tumor-specific CTCF mutations did not completely abrogate CTCF DNA-binding; rather, they selectively inhibited binding to some but not other CTCF target sites. Moreover, the four different tumor-specific missense mutations in the CTCF ZF domain all exhibited a remarkable functional similarity, displaying diminished binding (compared with the wild type CTCF) to target sites within the promoters/insulators of certain genes involved in regulating cell proliferation (MYC, PLK, PIM-1, p19ARF, and Igf2/H19) but exhibiting unaltered binding to the APPβ, β-globin, and lysozyme regulatory sequences (Fig. 2B) ⇓ .  The clustering of these tumor-derived CTCF mutations within ZF 3 and 7, the striking similarity in the functional consequences of these distinct mutations, and the tumor-specific nature of these mutations together strongly suggest that these CTCF mutations are not random polymorphisms but rather have significant biological consequences that likely contribute to the malignant phenotype. Indeed, we would predict that growth-regulatory genes such as MYC, p19ARF, and Igf2, to which CTCF binding is disrupted by the observed CTCF ZF mutations, might exhibit dysregulated expression in the tumors harboring these mutations. Because of a deficiency of adequate RNA from the corresponding tumor samples, we could not directly test this hypothesis. However, we used the p19ARF promoter to determine whether the diminished binding to CTCF target sites displayed by the tumor-specific CTCF ZF mutations had functional consequences. In comparison with the wild-type CTCF, all four of the CTCF ZF mutations that inhibited CTCF binding to the target site within the p19ARF promoter (Fig. 2) ⇓ resulted in a complete loss of CTCF-mediated activation of this promoter (Fig. 3) ⇓ . In contrast, in similar experiments with the APPβ promoter, to which the CTCF mutations showed unaltered binding (Fig. 2) ⇓ , the mutations had no effect on the APPβ promoter activation by CTCF (data not shown). Thus, the tumor-derived CTCF ZF mutations that result in the loss of binding of CTCF to its specific target sequence also result in a loss of its transcriptional activity at the corresponding gene.  Fig. 3. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Fig. 3. The tumor-specific CTCF mutations display a loss of transcriptional activation of the p19ARF promoter. CV-1 cells were cotransfected with the ARF promoter luciferase reporter (1 μg/plate), and 5 μg of either the wild-type (Wt) CTCF expression vector or an expression vector harboring the indicated ZF-mutant CTCF (see Fig. 2 ⇓ legend for identification) or an expression vector harboring the COOH-terminal CTCF region (C) that was used as a negative control for CTCF binding. Compared with the wild-type CTCF, the ZF-mutant CTCF proteins showed only a baseline level of the promoter activation defined by the signal observed with the empty expression vector or the COOH-terminal region of CTCF. Western analysis indicated that the production of CTCF proteins of expected size was nearly equal for each expression vector (not shown). Results are plotted as the average values of three independent experiments. Bars, SD. Loss of imprinting at the Igf2/H19 locus leading to increased expression of growth-promoting genes, such as Igf2, occurs in human cancer and is usually associated with aberrant methylation of the Igf2/H19 insulator domain, which includes CTCF binding sites (23 , 24) . The methylation-sensitive binding of CTCF to the Igf2/H19 insulator domain has been shown to be a critical mediator of the insulator function at this locus (7, 8, 9) . Therefore, it is expected that the activity of the Igf2/H19 insulator will be abolished in the absence of CTCF binding. Indeed, in a recent analysis of Wilms’ tumors selected for loss of imprinting of Igf2, where no CTCF mutations were found, aberrant biallelic methylation of the CTCF binding sites within the Igf2/H19 insulator domain that presumably disrupted CTCF binding was observed (25) . In this context it is important to note that all four of the tumor-specific CTCF ZF mutant proteins reported here failed to bind to CTCF sites within the Igf2/H19 insulator domain (Fig. 2) ⇓ . Together these observations suggest that tumor-specific loss of binding of CTCF to certain regulatory target sequences, such as the Igf2/H19 insulator, can occur through both genetic (i.e., CTCF ZF mutations) and/or epigenetic (aberrant CTCF binding site methylation) mechanisms.  Tumor-specific mutations of the classic tumor suppressor genes often result in a complete loss of their functional activity. Although our LOH analysis indicates that all of the tumors harboring CTCF mutations have lost one normal CTCF allele, in our screen of these tumors we did not identify any mutations that might lead to complete loss of CTCF function in the retained allele. Rather the observed tumor-specific CTCF ZF mutations selectively alter CTCF DNA binding specificity without completely abrogating CTCF function. Therefore, it is not surprising that such point mutations conferring selective loss of CTCF function appear infrequent (only four mutations found of 134 tumors examined). We hypothesize that certain CTCF activities, such as maintaining transcriptional insulator activity at specific loci or preserving presently unknown but critical regulatory functions, are essential in maintaining cell viability, and that complete loss of CTCF function might lead to cell death in both normal and/or malignant cells. Consistent with this hypothesis we have invariably noted CTCF expression in all cell types examined including both normal and transformed cells and have also observed that CTCF nullizygous mice exhibit embryonic lethality that occurs at a very early, preimplantation stage. 5 In contrast to complete loss of CTCF activity, the tumor-specific CTCF mutations that we have identified suggest that selective loss of CTCF function may be well tolerated and indeed might confer a selective growth advantage. Thus, the loss of binding of the tumor-specific CTCF mutants to the promoters/insulators of growth-regulatory genes such as MYC, p19ARF, and Igf2 (Fig. 2) ⇓ may dysregulate their expression and contribute to the malignant phenotype. Similarly, epigenetic phenomenon such as the tumor-specific methylation of CTCF binding sites within the Igf2/H19 insulator domain observed earlier (25) might also disrupt CTCF function at selective sites, leading to dysregulated cell proliferation. We suggest that such genetic- or epigenetic-directed specific shifts in the CTCF binding spectrum to functionally distinct regulatory sites may represent a novel mechanism involving “change of function” rather than “loss of function” for a transcription factor to become oncogenic. 
2284||Primitive round cell sarcomas of childhood and young adults have been problematic to diagnose and classify. Our goal was to investigate the pathologic and molecular characteristics of small blue round cell tumors (SBRCT) that remained unclassified after exhaustive immunohistochemistry and molecular screening to exclude known sarcoma-related translocations. As rare examples of EWSR1-negative SBRCT have been shown to carry rearrangements for FUS and CIC genes, we undertook a systematic screening for these two genes. CIC rearrangements by FISH were detected in 15/22 (68%), while none showed FUS abnormalities. RACE, RT-PCR and/or long range DNA PCR performed in two cases with frozen material showed that CIC was fused to copies of the DUX4 gene on either 4q35 or 10q26.3. Subsequent FISH analysis confirmed fused signals of CIC with either 4q35 or 10q26.3 region in six cases each. Tumors positive for CIC-DUX4 fusion occurred mainly in male young adult patients (median age: 29 years), with the extremities being the most frequent location. Microscopically, tumors displayed a primitive, round to oval cell morphology with prominent nucleoli, high mitotic count and areas of necrosis. O13 expression was variable, being either diffuse or patchy and tumors mostly lacked other markers of differentiation. Although CIC-DUX4 resulting in a t(4;19) translocation has been previously described in primitive sarcomas, this is the first report implicating the related DUX4 on 10q26 in oncogenesis. These results suggest the possibility of a newly defined subgroup of primitive round cell sarcomas characterized by CIC rearrangements, distinct from Ewing sarcoma family of tumors.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Primitive round cell sarcomas of childhood and young adults have been problematic to diagnose and classify. Even with the increased use of ancillary techniques, such as immunohistochemistry and molecular/genetic methods applied to archival material, a subset of these tumors cannot be classified in specific histologic types. It remains unclear if these tumors represent distinct biologic entities or belong to the same spectrum of previously described sarcoma subtypes, being characterized by yet undescribed, novel gene fusions.  A subset of tumors resembling microscopically Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (EFT), being composed mainly of primitive small round cells and occurring in children or young adults, remain unclassified, being negative for EWSR1, SS18(SYT), DDIT3(CHOP) and FOXO1(FKHR) gene rearrangements by FISH/RT-PCR, which constitute most of the known SBRCT-related translocations in this age group. A small number of cases sharing the undifferentiated EFT appearance have been characterized instead by either an FUS-ERG or CIC-DUX4 fusion (Shing et al., 2003; Ng et al., 2007; Berg et al., 2009). However, there have been no studies to date to systematically screen for these alternative fusions in a group of EWSR1-negative SBRCT. The purpose of this study is to address this issue in a group of SBRCT tumors which remained unclassified after exhaustive immunohistochemical and molecular/genetic work-up. Our hypothesis is that a more in-depth genetic characterization of these lesions may improve the present classification, which may encompass different pathologic entities under the somewhat ‘wastebasket’ terminology of undifferentiated/primitive sarcomas. This may have important clinical implications as well. Indeed, neoadjuvant and adjuvant combination chemotherapy including several drugs such as vincristine, dactinomycin, doxorubicin, ifosfamide and etoposide is the standard of care for patients with a diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma confirmed by molecular analysis. However, there is no consensus about the role of chemotherapy in “undifferentiated” sarcomas without specific molecular features, even if histology mimics Ewing sarcoma.  Go to: Material and Methods Patients and Tumor Characteristics  We retrieved 22 cases of sarcoma, diagnosed between 1997 and 2011 and characterized by a small blue round cell morphology, which were negative for the EWSR1 gene rearrangement by FISH and for other known pediatric sarcoma translocation by RT-PCR/FISH, from the surgical pathology files of our two institutions with available tissue for molecular analysis (IRB-protocol 02-060). The patient’s characteristics are described in Table 1. Median age was 29 years (range 14-69). Twenty cases (91%) arose from soft-tissue, one case from bone (SBRCT 18 – left ilium) and one case was visceral (SBRCT 14 – small intestine). The most frequent tumor location was the limb (10 cases, 45%). Most of the tumors were deep-seated, however, 3 cases (14%) were superficial associated with skin ulceration in two of them. Clinical follow-up information was available in 19 patients (86%). In each case, the diagnosis was confirmed by reviewing the H&E slides and the immunohistochemical stains. A subset of tumors which were initially tested only by RT-PCR studies to exclude EWSR1-FLI1 and EWSR1-ERG fusion transcripts were subsequently studied for EWSR1 gene abnormalities by FISH.  Table 1 Table 1 Clinical and Pathologic Findings of Small Blue Round Cell Tumors The tumors were assessed microscopically for growth pattern, cytomorphology (round, oval versus spindle cell), cellular pleomorphism, nucleolar size, mitotic activity, and necrosis. For each case, the location of the tumor was recorded, along with the anatomic structures involved. The immunohistochemical stains were re-reviewed and a minimum panel was required for inclusion in the study, including O13 and/or CD99, cytokeratin and/or EMA, and desmin. Most cases had in fact a much wider panel of stains performed, including neural/neuroendocrine markers, lymphoid markers (Table 2, Supplementary Table 1).  Table 2 Table 2 Immunohistochemical, Molecular and FISH findings in CIC-positive small blue round cell tumors Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) and Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)  Since the immunohistochemical profile of an undifferentiated SBRCT is quite often non-specific, the differential diagnosis under consideration was typically quite wide, including in addition to Ewing sarcoma family of tumors other entities such as a poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma and less commonly a small cell variant of angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma, round cell/myxoid liposarcoma and an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Thus, in addition to the genetic/molecular tests applied to exclude Ewing sarcoma, the molecular work-up often included RT-PCR for detecting other recurrent chromosomal translocation, such as SS18-SSX in 4 cases, EWSR1-ATF1/EWSR1-CREB1 in 3 cases, PAX-FOXO1 in 2 cases (Table 2). Additional FISH studies to exclude rearrangements in SS18 in 5 cases and DDIT3 in 2 cases were performed at the time of diagnosis.  FISH on interphase nuclei from paraffin embedded 4-micron sections was performed applying probes using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC), flanking EWSR1 in 22q12, FUS in 16p11, and CIC in 19q13. Since copies of the DUX4 retrogene are located at telomeric regions of both chromosomes 4 and 10(de Greef et al., 2008). respectively, BACs centromerically flanking the DUX4 region on 4q35 and 10q26.3 and BACs telomerically flanking CIC were used as fusion probes to verify the translocations of t(4;19) and t(10;19). The BAC probes spanning DUX4 genes covered 540 kb beyond the 200kb region of high homology of subtelomeric 4q35 and 10q26.3 (which includes the 100kb region of D4Z4 tandem repeats)(Lemmers et al., 2010b). BAC clones were chosen according to UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/)(Fig. 2). The BAC clones were obtained from BACPAC sources of Children’s Hospital of Oakland Research Institute (CHORI) (Oakland, CA) (http://bacpac.chori.org). DNA from individual BACs was isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions, labeled with different fluorochromes in a nick translation reaction, denatured, and hybridized to pretreated slides. Slides were then incubated, washed, and mounted with DAPI in an antifade solution, as previously described (Antonescu et al., 2010). The genomic location of each BAC set was verified by hybridizing them to normal metaphase chromosomes. Two hundred successive nuclei were examined using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan, Oberkochen, Germany), controlled by Isis 5 software (Metasystems). A positive score was interpreted when at least 20% of the nuclei showed a break-apart signal. Nuclei with incomplete set of signals were omitted from the score.

One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA preparation followed by a 3′-RACE, using the SMARTer™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clonetech, Mountain View, CA). Reverse transcribed mRNA was initiated at the poly(A) tail of mRNA with appropriate 3′-RACE CDS Primer A in a 10 μl reaction volume according to the manufacturer’s protocol. First round PCR was done by Clontech Advantage 2 PCR kit with the SMARTer™ RACE Universal Primer A Mix and CIC forward primer exon 17 (5′-TGAGTTGCCTGAGTTTCG-3′). Nested PCR was performed with the SMARTer™ RACE Nested Universal Primer A and CIC forward primer exon 19 (5′-GAGGACGTGCTTGGGGAGCTAGAGT-3′). Amplified PCR products were being cloned by TOPO® TA Cloning® Kit for Sequencing with One Shot® TOP10 Chemically Competent E. coli (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The constructed plasmid DNA was sequenced using Sanger’s method. To confirm RACE results, RT-PCR was performed by SuperScript® First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). CIC exon 19 and DUX4 exon 2 chromosome 10 (5′-CGGTGAGAGACTCCACACAGCGG-3′) were used as forward and reverse primers individually.  Long Range DNA PCR (LR-PCR)  Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen tissue by Phenol/Chloroform assay and quality was confirmed by electrophoresis. One microgram of genomic DNA was used for the LongRange PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) in the presence of Q solution to improve the thermostability and long range PCR efficiency. The following primers were used: CIC exon 17 forward primer (5′-CGCAAGAAGAGGAAGAACTCCACGG-3′) and DUX4 exon 1 reverse primer (5′-CGAGGAAGAATACCGGGCTCTGC -3′) to amplify the CIC-DUX4 on chromosome 4 (SBRCT 3); and CIC intron 19 forward primer (5′-GTGAGCCTGTCTCGGAGTCTTGGG -3′) and DUX4 intron 3 reverse primer (5′-CACAAAGCCCCCTGTAGACAAAGC -3′) to amplify the CIC-DUX4 on chromosome. 10 (SBRCT 9). The amplified long range PCR product was sequenced using the Sanger method.  Sequence analysis and comparison of D4Z4 sequence on chromosomes 4 and 10  The DUX4 sequences were accessed from ENST00000507734 (http://useast.ensembl.org/index.html) on chromosome 4 and uc001lns.2 (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?org=human) on chromosome 10. The starting point of the D4Z4 region was mapped by the KpnI restriction enzyme site (GGTACC) (Snider et al., 2009). As 4q35 D4Z4 units have a SNP combination of B-X+ (BlnI resistant and XapI sensitive), whereas chromosome 10q repeat arrays are usually homogeneous for B+X− D4Z4 units (XapI resistant and BlnI sensitive) (Lemmers et al., 2010b), we have investigated the BlnI (CCTAGG) and XapI (RAATTY) restriction sites in the D4Z4 sequences and cross-referenced to our genomic data from SBRCT 3 and 9 (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).  Statistical analysis  The statistical analysis of baseline demographics and clinical outcome is based on all data available up to the cut-off date, 31 May 2011. Survival rates were estimated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method.

Although some tumors showed focally a more ovoid or elongated configuration (Fig. 1A), distinct areas of spindling were seen only in two cases as a minor component. The latter was composed of short spindle cells arranged in a vague storiform or loose whorling (nodular) pattern (Fig. 1B). Areas of spindling arranged in well-defined fascicles, reminiscent of fibrosarcoma, were not present. Most tumor cells had an ill-defined cell border, with scant amount of amphophilic or lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, except for one tumor that showed focally a plasmacytoid appearance with more abundant cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). Most tumors showed vesicular nuclei, with distinct, often enlarged nucleoli. Although the presence of larger, pleomorphic cells was not seen, there was a higher degree of heterogeneity in nuclear shape and size, compared to the rather monomorphic appearance seen in EFT. Geographic areas of necrosis were commonly seen, as well as individual cell necrosis with ‘starry sky’ appearance (Fig. 1D). A high mitotic rate of >10MF/10HPFs was detected in all cases. There was no difference in morphology identified between the tumors associated and those which are not with a rearrangement of the CIC gene.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Morphologic appearance of CIC-rearranged lesions. A. Tumor composed of mixed round and oval cells, displaying less monomorphic cytomorphology compared to EFT, with a higher degree of variability in nuclear size and shape (SBRCT 9, 200x); B. rare tumors ... CIC gene rearrangement by FISH detected in two-thirds of undifferentiated SBRCT negative for EWSR1 abnormalities  Of the 22 patients included in the study, 15 (68%) showed a CIC rearrangement by FISH (fig. 2A). There were no FUS rearrangements detected by FISH in any of the 15 tumors tested.  The CIC-rearranged tumors were then investigated for DUX4 abnormalities on 4q35 by FISH. A CIC-DUX4 fused signal was detected in 6 of the 15 tumors tested (Fig. 2B). In one of the CIC-DUX4 positive cases by FISH (SBRCT 3), RACE and RT-PCR was attempted unsuccessfully using multiple primer combinations. The most likely explanation for this failure was the D4Z4 repetitive sequence of DUX4. However, by LR-PCR, the amplified 1.3 kb product confirmed the fusion of the 5′portion of CIC exon 20 to exon 1 of DUX4, located within the D4Z4 repeat and part of the coding sequence region of DUX4 on chromosome 4 (Fig. 3 A,B). The deduced amino-acid sequence of the chimeric protein indicated that as previously described by Kawamura-Saito et al (Kawamura-Saito et al., 2006) most of the CIC protein was preserved while a large part of the N-terminal region of DUX4 was lost including the two homeobox domains.  Figure 3Figure 3Figure 3 Figure 3 Long range genomic PCR of CIC-DUX4 in SBRCT 3. An 1,296 bp was amplified by LR-PCR and shown by gel electrophoresis (A), which by Sanger sequencing confirmed the fusion of 5′ portion of CIC exon 20 with DUX4 exon 1 on 4q35; * represents a short ... A novel t(10;19)translocation resulting in a CIC-DUX4 fusion detected by RACE and subsequently confirmed by RT-PCR, LR-PCR and FISH  RACE-PCR on SBRCT 9 identified a fusion between the first 80 bp of CIC exon 20 with the DUX4 exon 1 sequence on 10q26.3 (Fig. 4A). The same result was further obtained by RT-PCR, using the forward CIC exon 19 primer (5′-GAGGACGTGCTTGGGGAGCTAGAGT-3′) and reverse DUX4 exon 2 primer (5′-CGGTGAGAGACTCCACACAGCG -3′). By Sanger sequencing the 231 bp amplified product (Fig. 4B) showed the fusion of CIC exon 20 with DUX4 exon 2 on 10q26.3. A FISH BAC probe was then designed to cover the DUX4 locus on 10q26.3, which indeed showed a fused signal (Fig. 2C) and confirmed the RACE results.  Figure 4Figure 4Figure 4Figure 4 Figure 4 Demonstration of novel t(10;19) translocation resulting in CIC-DUX4 fusion in SBRCT 9. (A) RACE results identified the 5′ portion of CIC exon 20 fused to the first nucleotide of DUX4 exon 2 on 10q26.3; (B) RT-PCR confirmed an identical breakpoint ... At the DNA level, LR-PCR further confirmed the fusion of CIC exon 20 with DUX4 exon 1 at the 135497789 genomic position (Fig. 4C). The CIC breakpoint was identical with the one identified in SBRCT 3 with t(4;19).  The comparative analysis of the D4Z4 genomic sequence showed 100% homology between the SBRCT3 DUX4 sequence and the 4q35 D4Z4 reference sequence (ENST00000507734) and between SBRCT 9 DUX4 and the 10q26 D4Z4 published sequence (uc001lns.2)(Fig 3C). However, few deletions in the CDS region were identified within the D4Z4 on 10q26, but not in 4q35 (Fig. 3C).  Thereafter, the CIC-rearranged tumors without abnormal 4q35 signals were investigated for 10q26.3 abnormalities by FISH. A CIC-DUX4 fused signal was detected in 6 cases, in keeping with a t(10;19) translocation. There was no significant difference between tumors harboring a t(4;19) and t(10;19) in terms of histological features, clinical presentation or outcome.  Immunohistochemical Results  Among the CIC-rearranged tumors, 10 cases were diffusely positive for O13 and/or CD99, while 5 cases were only patchy and weakly positive (fig. 1E, Table 2). FLI1 was negative in three and weak/focal in the remaining four cases tested. Cytokeratin, EMA and S100 protein were each focally positive in two cases, while desmin was positive in one tumor. NSE was positive in all three cases tested, while none of the 11 cases tested showed reactivity for chromogranin and/or synaptophysin. Tumors were consistently negative for all lymphoid markers applied. In the CIC-negative rearranged group, O13 and/or CD99 were positive in all cases diffuse, except for one tumor in which staining was focal (Table S1). FLI1 staining was positive in one tumor and negative in the remaining two tumors tested.  Patient characteristics and radiological patterns The median age for the patients with a CIC-rearranged tumor was 29 years (range 15-60). The M/F sex-ratio was 2. Fourteen cases (93%) arose from soft-tissue and one case (7%) was visceral (small intestine). The most frequent tumor location was the limb (8 cases, 53%). Radiological features were non specific showing with magnetic resonance imaging intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images, high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and heterogeneous contrast enhancement. Tumour necrosis was frequently observed and represented up to 50% of the tumor volume. In two cases, baseline 18 [F] Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography baseline was available for review and showed hypermetabolism of the primary tumor (SUVmax of 4 and 14, respectively).  Clinical management and impact of chemotherapy All patients but one had surgical resection of the primary tumor. Five patients out of the 13 operated patients received 2 to 5 cycles of neaodjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted in administration of the VAC regimen (vincristine: 1.2mg/m2 day 1, doxorubicin: 37.5 mg/m2 day 1, cyclophosphamide: 2100 mg/m2 day 1; 21 day cycle) in four cases and of the AI (doxorubicin: 25 mg/m2 day 1-3, ifosfamide: 2000-3000 mg/m2 day 1-3; 21 day cycle) regimen in one case. According to RECIST, two patients had partial response, two patients had stable disease and one patient had progressive disease. For the two patients with PR, the proportion of residual tumor cells was 0% and 30% respectively whereas no histological evidence of chemotherapy efficacy was found for the two patients with stable disease. Eight patients received chemotherapy in the metastatic setting with various chemotherapy regimens. Six patients were evaluable for response. According to RECIST, one patient had complete response (AI), one had partial response (MAID: doxorubicin: 20 mg/m2 day 1-3, ifosfamide: 2500 mg/m2 day 1-3, dacarbazine: 225 mg/m2 day 1-3; day 1= day 21), and four had progressive disease.  Follow-up information and survival The median follow-up was 12 months. At the time of this writing, three patients are still under treatment for the primary tumor event. Eight patients (53%) developed metastatic disease. The median metastasis-free survival was 9.8 months (95% CI: 0-22). Metastases were synchronous in one case and metachronous in 7 cases. Lung was the most frequent metastatic site (six patients), but other metastatic sites were also observed in four cases including unusual ones such as brain. The median overall survival has not been reached. The one-year overall survival was 81%.  Go to: DISCUSSION The diagnostic challenge and subsequent uncertain clinical management related to the undifferentiated/primitive sarcoma of children and adolescents remains unresolved. The confusion is also enhanced by the grouping of SBRCT together with sarcomas displaying a spindle-fascicular growth, resembling ‘infantile fibrosarcoma’, under the meaningless term of undifferentiated sarcoma. Some of the larger series investigating this issue comes from the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS)(Pawel et al., 1997). Among the 1,527 patients entered on IRS-III and IRS pilot–IV, 34 (5%) remained unclassified after retrospective re-review and application of immunohistochemical ancillary techniques (but not molecular diagnostic techniques)(Pawel et al., 1997). The incidence of similar histology among soft tissue sarcoma in adults remains undefined.  Allagio et al. studied a group of seven undifferentiated pediatric and adolescent sarcoma lacking the known translocations associated with Ewing sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, etc (Alaggio et al., 2009). They observed two histologic patterns: one composed of primitive round cells and the other with elongated, spindle cells arranged in poorly formed fascicles. Although the two subgroups had overlapping immunoprofile and ultrastructural features, the tumors showing a primitive round cell morphology were associated with a more aggressive clinical course, compared to the ones with an undifferentiated spindle cell appearance. Specifically, the primitive small blue cell subgroup occurred more centrally on the trunk or proximal extremity and presented with advanced stage at diagnosis. They postulated that the differences in clinical presentation, outcome and morphology may suggest distinct biologic subgroups. In fact one of their cases of undifferentiated primitive sarcoma, arising in the chest wall of 5 year-old boy was associated with a 4q35 rearrangement, a der(4)t(4;?8)(q35;q22)(Alaggio et al., 2009). Corroborated with the tumors of similar morphology reported by both Pawel (Pawel et al., 1997) and Sebire (Sebire et al., 2002), it emerges that undifferentiated sarcomas with a spindle cell phenotype and resembling infantile-fibrosarcoma are associated with a relatively favorable outcome. Of note, six undifferentiated sarcomas composed of a mixed round and spindle cell ‘fibrosarcoma-like’ appearance studied here by FISH did not show the presence of CIC rearrangements (data not shown).  As EWSR1 and FUS belong to the same FET family of RNA-binding proteins and appear to be functionally interchangeable, it is maybe not surprising that FUS was found to be fused to one member of ETS transcription factor family in a group of EFT (Shing et al., 2003; Ng et al., 2007; Berg et al., 2009). Thus 5 tumors with FUS-ERG fusion (Shing et al., 2003) (Berg et al., 2009) and one case with FUS-FEV have been reported to date (Ng et al., 2007). Despite these results, none of our 15 SBRCT tested showed FUS rearrangements by FISH, suggesting an infrequent involvement of FUS in this specific group of tumors.  CIC, a human homologue of Drosophila capicua, encodes for a high mobility group (HMG) box transcription factor. Drosophila Cic has been shown to mediate c-erbB (Egfr) signaling via transcriptional repression (Roch et al., 2002). Like several of the Sox genes, Cic is also predominantly overexpressed in the cerebellum (Lee et al., 2002), as well in subsets of medulloblastoma (Lee et al., 2005).  Human 4q and 10q subtelomeric regions contain the polymorphic macrosatellite repeat D4Z4, which share high sequence homology over a region of >200 kb (Lemmers et al., 2010b). Each D4Z4 repeat unit contains a conserved open reading frame for the DUX4 retrogene, encoding for the double-homeobox transcription factor (van Geel et al., 2002). DUX4 is normally expressed in human testis and germline cells, and is epigenetically suppressed in differentiated cells. Residual DUX4 transcripts are spliced to remove the carboxyterminal domain that has been associated with cell toxicity (Snider et al., 2010). The contraction of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array in the subtelomeric region of 4q35, but not 10q26, causes fascioscapular muscular dystrophy (FSMD). However, this contraction is pathogenic only in certain permissive configurations, such as the formation of a canonical polyadenylation signal for transcripts derived from DUX4, by single nucleotide polymorphisms distal to the last D4Z4 repeat (Lemmers et al., 2010a). These findings suggest that FSMD arises through a toxic gain of function attributable to the stabilized distal DUX4 transcript.  CIC-DUX4 was previously shown to transform NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Kawamura-Saito et al., 2006). As a consequence of fusion with the C-terminal of DUX4, the transcriptional activity of CIC is enhanced, suggesting a deregulation of downstream targets. CIC-DUX4 binds to the ERM/ETV5 promoter by recognizing a novel target sequence, up-regulating its expression. From the fusion transcript, the deduced chimeric protein would include the HMG box of CIC, the putative binding site of TLE proteins, and highly conserved regions between human CIC and Drosophila capicua. In contrast, a large part of N-terminal DUX4 region was lost, including the DNA-binding double homeodomain. Tetracycline-inducible CIC-DUX4 expression in U2OS cells was associated with overexpression of ERM/ETV5, ETV1/ER81, RaLP, and CCL2. The same pattern of up-regulation was also present in the t(4;19) positive tumors. ChIP assays showed that PEA3 family genes are targets for the CIC-DUX4 by a t(4;19) translocation. PEA3 represents one major subgroup of the superfamily of Ets-related transcription factors and is composed of three members, PEA3 (E1AF or ETV4)(Xin et al., 1992), ER81/ETV1 (Brown and McKnight, 1992) and ERM/ETV5 (Monte et al., 1994). These three factors regulate the expression of several target genes involved in tumorigenesis (de Launoit et al., 1997) Interestingly, both PEA3 and ETV1 have been described as fusion partner genes of EWSR1 in EFT (Jeon et al., 1995) Therefore, it has been suggested that up-regulation of PEA3 family genes by CIC-DUX4 may represent a molecular change equivalent to the EWSR1-ETS fusion (Kawamura-Saito et al., 2006).  The identification of a subgroup of undifferentiated sarcomas characterized by a fusion between genes which are not related to EWSR1 or the ETS family may have significant clinical implications. A recurrent t(4;19)(q35;q13.1) translocation, resulting in a CIC-DUX4 fusion, has been reported in seven other cases (Table 3) (Richkind et al., 1996; Kawamura-Saito et al., 2006; Rakheja et al., 2008; Yoshimoto et al., 2009; Graham et al., 2011 ). The combined analysis of the clinical data from these case reports and from our series indicates a male predominance (sex ratio M/F=1.2), a median age at diagnosis of 28 years (range 6-69), a frequent tumor location in the limb (10 cases out of 22, 45%) and a high rate of metastatic relapse (11 cases out of 18 with available follow-up, 61%). Therefore, besides similar histological patterns, these tumors share with EFT a very aggressive clinical course. This raises the question of the optimal management of patients with EWSR1-negative SBRCT and more particularly of the role of adjuvant (or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. Indeed, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in the management of young adult or adult patients with soft-tissue sarcoma remains a controversial issue due to the lack of clearly proven survival benefit (Blay and Le Cesne, 2009). However, adjuvant (or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy is the standard of care for adults with a diagnosis of EFT or rhabdomyosarcoma as well as for children (Balamuth and Womer, 2010; Huh and Skapek, 2010). Many clinicians managing patients with localized soft-tissue sarcoma would not propose chemotherapy besides the loco-regional treatment except in the case of a diagnosis of EFT or rhabdomyosarcoma. Therefore, we believe that our results showing a high prevalence of rearrangement of CIC in EWSR1-negative SBRCT support the routine testing of this gene in this group of tumor. In our study, four patients presenting with localized disease at diagnosis were treated according to the institution’s guidelines for EFT (neoadjuvant VAC regimen). Two patients had radiologically stable disease, one partial response and one had progressive disease. The low number of cases does not allow us to compare the chemosensitivity of CIC-rearranged tumors to that of EWSR1-rearranged EFT. Therefore, further studies are needed to clarify the role of chemotherapy in CIC-rearranged SBRCT. We propose that these patients should not be denied inclusion in EFT clinical trials, but rather be analyzed as a separate stratum.  Table 3 Table 3 Previously Reported Undifferentiated Sarcomas with t(4;19) or Rearrangements Involving 4q35 or 19q13  Ewing’s family tumors (EFTs) are highly malignant tumors arising from bone and soft tissues that exhibit EWS–FLI1 or variant EWS–ETS gene fusions in more than 85% of the cases. Here we show that CIC, a human homolog of Drosophila capicua which encodes a high mobility group box transcription factor, is fused to a double homeodomain gene DUX4 as a result of a recurrent chromosomal translocation t(4;19)(q35;q13). This translocation was seen in two cases of soft tissue sarcoma diagnosed as Ewing-like sarcoma. CIC–DUX4 exhibits a transforming potential for NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and as a consequence of fusion with a C-terminal fragment of DUX4, CIC acquires an enhanced transcriptional activity, suggesting that expression of its downstream targets might be deregulated. Gene expression analysis identified the ETS family genes, ERM/ETV5 and ETV1, as potential targets for the gene product of CIC–DUX4. Indeed, CIC–DUX4 directly binds the ERM promoter by recognizing a novel target sequence and significantly up-regulates its expression. This study clarifies the function of CIC and its role in tumorigenesis, as well as the importance of the PEA3 subclass of ETS family proteins in the development of EFTs arising through mechanisms different from those involving EWS–ETS chimeras. Moreover, the study identifies the role of DUX4 that is closely linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy in transcriptional regulation. INTRODUCTION Recurrent chromosomal translocations are observed frequently among bone and soft tissue tumors in a tumor type-specific manner (1). Many of these chromosomal translocations involve genes encoding transcription factors (2), and fusion to the partner gene on a different chromosome results in the acquisition of novel functions. These oncogenic transcription factors may dysfunctionally regulate their downstream targets, thus making an important contribution to the multi-step biological process of carcinogenesis. In bone and soft tissue tumors, there is strict relationship between tumor types and gene fusions, suggesting that a chimeric gene may be generated in multi-potent stem cells and may determine a tumor phenotype by modulating its differentiation process. Alternatively, a tumorigenic potency of a chimeric gene may be effective only in a certain cell type. Ewing family tumors (EFTs) include Ewing’s sarcoma, Askin’s tumor and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors and they afflict children and young adults (3). EFTs are aggressive tumors with massive and destructive growth at the primary loci, and they have a high incidence of # The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Most cases of EFTs are characterized cytogenetically by fusion between the 50 site of the EWS gene at 22q12 and the 30 site of the members of the ETS family of transcription factors including FLI1 (11q24), ERG (21q22), ETV1 (7p22), E1AF (17q12) or FEV (2q33) (5 – 9). In 85% of the cases, EWS is fused to FLI1 and the chimeric EWS –FLI1 protein is composed of the N-terminal transactivation domain of EWS and the C-terminal ETS DNA-binding domain. It is presumed that an altered pattern of gene expression results and that this is of importance in tumorigenesis (10 – 13). In addition, EWS as a TET family protein associates with RNA splicing factors, and EWS –FLI1 modulates RNA splicing (14). It remains to be clarified whether the EWS–ETS fusion gene is essential for carcinogenesis of EFTs, as EWS–ETS expression is not sufficient to induce fully developed EFTs (15). A FUS– ERG fusion has been identified in a few cases of Ewing’s sarcoma (16). In these cases, FUS serves a function equivalent to that of EWS. However, it is also possible that unknown oncogenes exist that are structurally unrelated but that function in the same molecular pathway as EWS –ETS in oncogenesis of EFTs. Alternatively, there may be a novel disease category that is related to but biologically not identical with EFTs. We describe here two cases of Ewing-like sarcomas containing a novel chromosomal translocation t(4;19)(q35;q13). These tumors shared pathologically similar features with Ewing’s sarcoma. However, apparent lack of EWS–ETS fusion and weak expression of CD99/MIC2, a marker of EFTs, made diagnosis and classification of these tumors diffi- cult. CIC, a human homolog of the Drosophila capicua gene, was identified at the 19q13 breakpoint, where it was found fused to the DUX4 double homeodomain gene. Furthermore, CIC –DUX4 functions as a transcriptional activator and two members of the PEA3 subfamily genes are its direct targets. These studies illuminate a molecular network of transcription factors and demonstrate the important role of ETS family proteins in development of mesenchymal tumors and phenotypes for small round cell tumors. RESULTS Pathological examination and chromosome analysis Two cases of malignant soft part tumors showed the typical histopathological features of Ewing’s sarcoma display t(4;19)(q35;q13). Details of the clinicopathological features of these two cases are shown in Materials and Methods. As shown in Figure 1, characteristic features were diffuse infiltrative growth of small round tumor cells (Fig. 1A) that were positive for glycogen granules within their cytoplasms (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor cells revealed that they expressed CD99/MIC2 (Fig. 1C), though the expression is much weaker than that of typical EFT (Fig. 1D). Conventional chromosome analysis revealed that both cases carried reciprocal t(4;19)(q35;q13) as sole translocations and no chromosome 22 rearrangements were observed (data not shown). Dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 19q13 showed that the breakpoint was located within the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone RP11-569M1 (Fig. 2). RP11-569M1 covers the 230 kb region within 19q13 (Fig. 2C, top) and contains at least 10 genes. Using multiple probes and tumor DNA samples, the breakpoint was determined by Southern blotting. DNA rearrangements were detected in both cases when a probe derived from exon 10 of the CIC gene encoding a high mobility group (HMG) box containing protein was used (Fig. 2C and D), indicating that CIC is a target for the 19q13 break. Detection of the CIC–DUX4 chimera A subgenomic library was constructed by using DNA obtained from the tumor cells derived from case 2. A 5.0 kb BamHI fragment containing both 19q and 4q regions was isolated, and sequence analysis revealed that the genetic breakpoint at 19q13 was located inside CIC exon 20 and that of 4q was within the coding region of the DUX4 double homeodomain gene, located within the D4Z4 repeat at the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q (17). Reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction (RT –PCR) analysis of tumor RNA samples was then carried out to check for chimeric transcripts containing both CIC and DUX4. As shown in Figure 3A, lanes 1 and 2, CIC–DUX4 fusions were detected in both cases; however, no reciprocal DUX4–CIC fusion was observed (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Approximately 10 kb aberrant CIC as well as wild-type transcripts were detected in both cases by northern blotting using a CIC cDNA fragment as a probe (Fig. 3B). The aberrant signals were also detected by using a DUX4 probe (Fig. 3B). Expression of wild-type DUX4 was not detected by northern blotting or RT –PCR (Fig. 3B) (data not shown). Sequence analysis of fusion transcripts revealed that CIC was fused in frame to DUX4 and the deduced amino acid sequences of the chimeric proteins were determined (Fig. 3C).

Putative MAPK phosphorylation sites of CIC were also preserved. In contrast, a large part of the N-terminal DUX4 region was lost, including the DNA-binding double homeodomain. The predicted structure of the CIC –DUX4 chimera suggests that it may dysregulate its downstream target genes without altering the DNA-binding property of the CIC HMG box. Endogenous expression of the CIC – DUX4 protein was detected in the cell line ECD1 established from case 2 tumor using a polyclonal anti-CIC serum (Fig. 3D). Figure 2.

(D) Immunoblotting for CIC–DUX4. 1, U2OS; 2, ECD1. CIC–DUX4 is detected by using an anti-CIC serum. Weak expression of the wild-type CIC is shown in U2OS cells. The anti-b-tubulin was used as control. 2128 Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 13 The CIC–DUX4 protein transforms NIH 3T3 cells and is a strong transcriptional activator The oncogenic potential of CIC–DUX4 was determined in an NIH 3T3 cell transformation assay. The entire coding region of CIC–DUX4 was inserted into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector and introduced into NIH 3T3 cells. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the CIC–DUX4 chimera formed significantly increased anchorage-independent colonies in soft agar compared to mock-transfected or wildtype CIC-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). The result indicates that CIC–DUX4 functions as a dominant oncogene, and the chimeric protein may act as an oncogenic transcription factor. The transcriptional activity of CIC –DUX4 was then examined to clarify whether the wild-type CIC function is affected by fusion with the DUX4 sequence. cDNA fragments encoding wild-type CIC, CIC –DUX4, CIC lacking the Cterminal region or the DUX4 C-terminus were subcloned into the pM vector to obtain fusion products with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Fig. 4B). These constructs were co-transfected into HeLa cells with a luciferase reporter vector bearing a 5   GAL4 DNA-binding sequence. The wildtype CIC showed weak repression activity, whereas CIC – DUX4 showed 130-fold and 81-fold enhancement of transcriptional activities against the wild-type CIC and the pM vector, respectively (Fig. 4C). Because the DUX4 C-terminus showed even stronger activity (395-fold against wild-type CIC), and the repression activity of CIC DC-terminus was similar to that of CIC, it is very likely that the addition of the DUX4 C-terminus causes drastic modification of the CIC transcriptional activity. These results strongly suggested that the expression of CIC downstream targets might be perturbed by CIC –DUX4. Figure 4. Transforming and transcriptional activities of CIC–DUX4.

Enhanced luciferase activities were observed when the expression plasmids with a GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the full-length CIC–DUX4 or the DUX4 C-terminus were introduced. The means + standard deviations from three independent experiments are shown. Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 13 2129 CIC–DUX4 modulates the gene expression profile To determine whether the global gene expression profile is modulated by CIC–DUX expression, and to identify important downstream target genes, RNA samples extracted from U2OS cells with tetracycline-inducible expression of the wild-type CIC or CIC–DUX4 (Fig. 5A) were assessed by the Affymetrix GeneChip microarray system. Statistical comparisons identified 22 altered genes (30 probe sets) whose expression was significantly up-regulated in CIC–DUX4-expressing cells (Table 1). In contrast, only three genes were found to be down-regulated in CIC–DUX4 expressing cells (data not shown). This result is consistent with data obtained from the transactivation assay, and it again suggests that the chimera functions as a transcriptional activator to a majority of the target genes. Expression of 11 of the 22 up-regulated genes was validated by using quantitative RT –PCR, and significant up-regulation by CIC –DUX4 of five genes (ERM/ETV5, ETV1/ER81, MGC45780, RaLP and CCL2) both in the tet-inducible U2OS system and in the t(4;19) tumors was confirmed (Fig. 5B) (data not shown). Expression of ERM and ETV1, members of the PEA3 subclass of the ETS transcription factor gene family, was further analyzed using RNA samples derived from the original tumor tissues and cell lines. Enhanced expression of ERM and ETV1 was observed in the tumor tissue of case 1, and the cell line ECD1 established from case 2 tumor was compared with Ewing’s sarcoma with respect to EWS–FLI1 or EWS–ERG fusions (Fig. 5B). Both exogenous and endogenous expressions of CIC–DUX4 were found to up-regulate ERM and ETV1. Furthermore, expression of E1AF, another member of the PEA3 family, was significantly increased in case 1 tumor tissue and in ECD1 cells (data not shown). ERM promoter contains a CIC responsive element and is up-regulated by CIC–DUX4 To test whether ERM expression is directly regulated by CIC – DUX4, the potential promoter region of the human ERM gene was examined. A search for the genomic region 4 kb upstream of the ERM exon 1a using PROSCAN (http://bimas.dcrt.nih. gov/molbio/proscan/) revealed that there is a potential TATA box (tataaa) 309 bp upstream of the exon 1a 50 end. A 988 bp fragment including the potential TATA box (Fig. 6A) was subcloned into the pGL3 basic vector and the luciferase activity was measured in HeLa or ECD1 cells. Strong promoter activity was present within the fragment in ECD1 cells, whereas no activity was shown in HeLa cells (Fig. 6B, 235-fold activity in ECD1 compared with HeLa). When CIC –DUX4 was co-transfected with the reporter plasmid in HeLa cells, the luciferase activity was significantly enhanced (Fig. 6C). The enhanced luciferase activity was not observed for wild-type CIC. The reporter assay using deletion constructs showed that the 290 bp fragment indeed contains a CIC –DUX4 responsive element (Fig. 6D). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using the ECD1 cell line and the CIC antiserum further exhibited CIC binding on a 290 bp region inside of the CIC –DUX4 responsive element (Fig. 6E). In contrast, no CIC binding was observed at the downstream region of the responsive element. These data suggest that the region of the ERM promoter may contain a CIC recognition site that is directly responsive for and is activated by CIC –DUX4. CIC–DUX4 recognizes a consensus octameric sequence and directly activates PEA3 family genes To further evaluate direct regulation of the ERM promoter by CIC –DUX4, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was carried out using a fusion protein between the CIC HMG box and glutathione S-transferase (GST), as the HMG box is a potential DNA binding-domain (19). The CIC HMG box showed specific binding to the DNA fragment within the minimal ERM promoter and the HMG box-bound DNA complex disappeared in the presence of anti-GST (Fig. 7A). The binding specificity was also confirmed by adding a cold competitor (Fig. 7B), and a CIC-binding sequence (CBS) 50 -TGAATGAA-30 was identified. The pGL3 promoter plasmid containing triple tandem repeats of CBS was generated, and transcriptional activation by CIC –DUX4 was evident (Fig. 7C). The promoter region of ETV1 that is also up-regulated by CIC –DUX4 was then analyzed. Sequence analysis revealed that a 50 -TGAATGGA-30 sequence, very similar to CBS with only a difference at the seventh nucleotide, is present 921 bp upstream of exon 1 of ETV1. Co-transfection of the reporter containing this region and the CIC –DUX4 plasmid indicated that CIC –DUX4 recognized the region as a specific promoter of ETV1 (Fig. 7D). A ChIP assay again confirmed CIC binding on a 312 bp region containing the CBS-like sequence (Fig. 7E). Furthermore, sequence analysis of the E1AF promoter region revealed that there are two octamer sequences identical to CBS 740 bp upstream of the exon 1. These data indicate that all three members of the PEA3 family and their activation regions are major targets for CIC –DUX4 by a t(4;19) translocation. DISCUSSION We report the identification of a CIC–DUX4 fusion that was found in two cases of Ewing-like sarcoma bearing the recurrent t(4;19)(q35;q13). The t(4;19) is a rare chromosomal translocation, not appeared as a recurrent translocation in a public database (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman). No similar chromosomal abnormality has been observed in 600 cases of malignant bone and soft tissue tumors examined in our institute. However, a case of primitive mesenchymal tumor with t(4;19)(q35;q13.1) developed in a 12-year-old boy was reported (20). The similar translocation was also detected in rhabdomyosarcoma with complex chromosomal aberrations (21,22). Thus, t(4;19) translocation may be a genetic hallmark of a subclass in small round cell tumors, despite its rare occurrence. The C-terminal region of DUX4 becomes fused to CIC, and CIC–DUX4 acquires a transforming activity against NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, indicating that CIC–DUX4 acts as a dominant oncogene. The fusion of the DUX4 sequence to CIC provides a strong transcriptional activity. There was no significant 2130 Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 13 difference of intracellular localization between the wild-type CIC and CIC –DUX4 (data not shown). Therefore, it is intriguing to clarify the protein components of CIC- and CIC– DUX-DNA binding complexes. The DUX4 fusion to CIC up-regulates PEA3 family genes, which might play an important role in tumorigenesis. Although PEA3 family genes were identified using expression profiling in U2OS osteosarcoma cells, high-level expression of PEA3 genes has been confirmed in the original tumor samples. Two of three PEA3 family genes, ETV1 and E1AF, are fused to EWS in EFTs with t(7;22) and t(17;22), respectively (7,8), and it is considered that functions of ETS proteins, including PEA3 proteins, are enhanced upon fusion with EWS (15). Up-regulation of PEA3 family genes by CIC –DUX4 is therefore an equivalent molecular change to the EWS–ETS fusion, and Ewing’s sarcoma with the CIC–DUX4 fusion does not require an EWS–ETS fusion. Figure 5. Up-regulation of PEA3 family genes by CIC–DUX4. (A) Tet-induced expression of the wild-type CIC and CIC–DUX4 proteins was detected by immunoblotting with anti-CIC serum or anti-HA.

The mean expression ratios normalized against b-actin of three independent experiments are shown. Standard deviations are indicated as error bars. Human Molecular Genetics, 2006, Vol. 15, No. 13 2131 There were close similarities including shared pathological features between the present cases and EFTs with conventional EWS–ETS fusions. These patients were somewhat older than the characteristic age range seen for EFTs, and CD99/ MIC2 expression in these cases was weaker than that typical of Ewing’s tumor cells. These tumors might belong to a novel disease category; however, up-regulation of PEA3 family genes by CIC –DUX4 indicates a close similarity in molecular pathogenesis between t(4;19) tumors and EFTs. Up-regulation of PEA3 family genes has been reported in a series of human malignant neoplasms such as breast, ovarian and gastrointestinal cancers, and their overexpression is related to invasive and metastatic phenotypes (22 –26). More recently, ETV1 has been found fused to androgen-driven TMPRSS2 in human prostatic cancers (27). Together with these data, our present study underscores the importance of the PEA3 family in tumorigenesis and tumor progression in a broad spectrum of human malignancies. CIC is a human homolog of the Drosophila capicua gene product that has been identified as a transcriptional repressor of the torso receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway (18). The repression activity of capicua against tailless and huckebein is achieved by interaction with the co-repressor groucho, and the RTK signal dissociates the interaction between capicua and groucho resulting in precise posterior patterning (18,28). In addition, capicua acts as a positive regulator for pipe in follicle cells (29). Although the physiological function of this protein in human CIC remains to be clarified, it is expressed in developing cerebellar neurons and is involved in ErbB signaling (30,31). Our present study has indicated that CIC functions as a sequence-specific transcription factor by binding TGAATG(G/A)A, although the binding capability is modest, as in the case of other HMG box proteins (32,33). The homology of the HMG box with CIC and other HMG family proteins is not very high, and the identified consensus sequence is different from the canonical CC(T/A)TTG(T/A) (T/A)CT of LEF1, SRY or ROX1 (19), suggesting that CIC may belong to a novel subfamily of HMG box proteins. DUX4 is located within the D4Z4 sequence, which is a 3.3 kb tandem repeat located at the subtelomeric region of 4q as well as of other chromosomes including 10q, 21q and 22q (34). The translocation breakpoint at 4q35 is closely linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), and the copy number of D4Z4 is significantly reduced in FSHD patients (17). The biological function of DUX4, however, remains unclear, and its expression has not been clearly demonstrated yet (35). Our report is the first indication that the gene at the FSHD locus is in fact involved in human diseases. It has been proposed that D4Z4 may function as a cis-acting element and that the reduced number of D4Z4 may affect expression of other nearby genes (36). This hypothesis is fascinating because the 4q35 with the normal number of the D4Z4 repeats may repress the genes located around the 19q13 break such as ERF, which encodes the ETS repression factor. However, our preliminary experiments failed to show significant changes in gene expression of ERF, GSK3A, PAFAGH1B3 or EGFL4 (Fig. 2C) between t(4;19) tumors and conventional Ewing’s sarcomas (Nakamura, T., unpublished data). Alternatively, a more dynamic structural alteration such as chromosomal looping (37) may affect expression of 19q genes located at more distant regions. Together with the earlier investigations, our present study indicates that the major oncogenic effect of the t(4;19) translocation is alteration of the transactivating potency of the CIC –DUX4 chimera and the DUX4 C-terminus contributes to this increased potency.  
3061||Somatic mutations in exon 2 of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional Mediator subunit MED12 occur at very high frequency (∼70%) in uterine leiomyomas. However, the influence of these mutations on Mediator function and the molecular basis for their tumorigenic potential remain unknown. To clarify the impact of these mutations, we used affinity-purification mass spectrometry to establish the global protein-protein interaction profiles for both wild-type and mutant MED12. We found that uterine leiomyoma-linked mutations in MED12 led to a highly specific decrease in its association with Cyclin C-CDK8/CDK19 and loss of Mediator-associated CDK activity. Mechanistically, this occurs through disruption of a MED12-Cyclin C binding interface that we also show is required for MED12-mediated stimulation of Cyclin C-dependent CDK8 kinase activity. These findings indicate that uterine leiomyoma-linked mutations in MED12 uncouple Cyclin C-CDK8/19 from core Mediator and further identify the MED12/Cyclin C interface as a prospective therapeutic target in CDK8 driven cancers.  Go to: Introduction Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) are monoclonal neoplasms of the myometrium and represent the most common pelvic tumor in reproductive age women (Stewart, 2001). Although benign, they are nonetheless associated with significant morbidity. They are the primary indicator for hysterectomy, and a major cause of gynecologic and reproductive dysfunction, ranging from profuse menstrual bleeding and pelvic discomfort to infertility, recurrent miscarriage, and pre-term labor (Stewart, 2001). Recently, we discovered that mutations in exon 2 of the Xq13 gene encoding the transcriptional Mediator subunit MED12 occur at very high frequency (∼70%) in uterine leiomyomas (Makinen et al., 2011). Along with their high-frequency occurrence, two additional genetic findings suggest that MED12 mutations likely contribute to the genesis of uterine leiomyomas. First, all observed MED12 exon 2 mutations affect highly evolutionarily conserved regions of the MED12 protein, including three principal hotspot mutations in codons 36, 43, and 44 (Makinen et al., 2011). Second, localization of the missense mutations to a small number of amino-acids suggests that the MED12 mutations are dominant and that MED12 acts as an oncogene (Vogelstein et al., 2013), providing a likely etiological basis previously lacking for the majority of these clinically significant tumors. Compatible with the key role of MED12 in controlling gene expression, we have also shown that the RNA expression patterns of MED12 mutant leiomyomas cluster tightly together and form a clearly separate branch distinct from all other leiomyomas (Mehine et al., 2013).  Mediator is a conserved multisubunit signal processor through which regulatory information conveyed by gene-specific transcription factors is transduced to RNA polymerase II (pol II). Structurally, Mediator is assembled from a set of core subunits into three distinct modules termed “head”, “middle”, and “tail”, that bind tightly to pol II in the so-called holoenzyme (Conaway and Conaway, 2011; Kornberg, 2005; Lariviere et al., 2012; Malik and Roeder, 2010; Spaeth et al., 2011; Taatjes, 2010). MED12, along with MED13, Cyclin C and CDK8 or CDK19, comprise a fourth “kinase” module that exists in variable association with core Mediator. The kinase module was originally implicated in negative regulation of pol II-dependent transcription (Akoulitchev et al., 2000; Knuesel et al., 2009a; van de Peppel et al., 2005). Several more recent studies, however, have also characterized a positive role for CDK8 activity in transcription (Donner et al., 2010; Firestein et al., 2008; Morris et al., 2008).  MED12 links Cyclin C-CDK8 with core Mediator and also stimulates Cyclin C-dependent CDK8 kinase activity (Ding et al., 2008; Knuesel et al., 2009b). Although the mechanism by which MED12 activates CDK8 is unknown, MED12-dependent CDK8 activation is nonetheless required for nuclear transduction of signals propagated by several different oncogenic pathways with which MED12 is biochemically and genetically linked (Firestein et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2006; Spaeth et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2012). Furthermore, MED12 itself is a target of oncogenic mutation, including exon 2 mutations linked to uterine leiomyomas (Barbieri et al., 2012; Je et al., 2012; Kampjarvi et al., 2012; Makinen et al., 2011). However, the impact of these mutations on MED12 function and the molecular basis for their tumorigenic potential remain unknown.  Go to: Results and Discussion Uterine leiomyoma-linked mutations in MED12 disrupt its association with CycC-CDK8/19  To identify proteins that bind differentially to wild-type and oncogenic MED12, we engineered stable, tetracycline inducible Flp-In™ 293 T-REx cell lines expressing C-terminally Twin-Strep-tag®-modified wild-type (WT) MED12 or its most common leiomyoma mutant derivative (G44D) (see experimental procedures for details) (Glatter et al., 2009) (Varjosalo et al., 2013). Quantitative immunoblot analysis revealed that tagged WT and mutant MED12 proteins attained induced levels of expression (∼0.8-1.6 × 105 molecules per cell) comparable to that of endogenous 293 cell MED12 (∼0.4-0.8 × 105 molecules per cell) (Fig. S1A). Affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) (Fig.1A and Fig. S1B) revealed a specific and reproducible (n = 3) reduction in the binding of Cyclin C, CDK8 and CDK19 to mutant versus wild-type MED12 (Fig. 1B; Table S1).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Leiomyoma-linked mutations in MED12 disrupt its interaction with Cyclin C-CDK8/19 and diminish Mediator-associated kinase activity. (A) Schematic illustration of MED12 WT and G44D mutant protein-protein-interactome screen. (B) Normalized abundance of ... Relative quantification of MED12-associated Mediator subunits confirmed a statistically significant loss of kinase module, as opposed to core, Mediator subunits in mutant versus wild-type MED12 affinity purifications (Fig. 1C and Table S2). We confirmed the reduced association of CDK8 and CDK19 with MED12 G44D by IP-Western (Fig. 1D), and further established that this defect extends to other uterine leiomyoma-linked exon 2 mutations in MED12, including L36R, Q43P, and G44S. Thus, FLAG-specific immunoprecipitates from HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged MED12 mutant derivatives bore significantly reduced levels of Cyclin C, CDK8, and CDK19, but not core Mediator subunits, as well as diminished pol II C-terminal domain (CTD)-directed kinase activity compared to those from wild-type MED12-expressing cells (Fig. 1E).  Uterine leiomyoma-linked mutations in MED12 disrupt its direct interaction with CycC-CDK8  To determine whether leiomyoma-linked mutations in MED12 disrupt its direct interaction with Cyclin C-CDK8, we analyzed recombinant kinase module variants reconstituted from baculovirus expressed subunits. CDK8 immunoprecipitates from insect cells co-expressing CDK8, Cyclin C, and either WT or mutant MED12 derivatives (L36R, Q43P, or G44S) were monitored for the presence of MED12 and the level of CDK8 kinase activity. Note that these reconstitution assays were performed in the absence of MED13, since the latter does not appreciably impact the integrity or activity of a trimeric MED12/Cyclin C/CDK8 submodule assembly (Fig. S1C). Compared to WT MED12, all three of the MED12 leiomyoma mutants were severely compromised for both Cyclin C-CDK8 binding and activation (Fig. 1F). We mapped the Cyclin C-CDK8 binding domain on MED12 to within its N-terminal 100 amino acids encoded largely by exons 1 and 2 (Fig. 2A and B), and further confirmed that MED12 (1-100) binds to and activates Cyclin C-CDK8 (Fig. 2C). This suggests that exon 2 mutations in MED12 likely disrupt its Cyclin C-CDK8 binding interface as opposed to triggering conformational masking of a distant interaction site elsewhere in the protein. Together, these findings identify for the first time a common functional defect associated with uterine leiomyoma-linked mutations in MED12 and further suggest that disruption of its Cyclin C-CDK binding activity contributes to leiomyoma formation.  Figure 2 Figure 2 The MED12 N-terminal 100 amino acids binds to and activates MED12 activates CDK8 through direct interaction with CycC  To clarify the molecular basis by which exon 2 mutations in MED12 disrupt its direct interaction with Cyclin C-CDK8, we first resolved kinase module subunit interactions using recombinant baculovirus-expressed proteins. Immunopurification of the kinase module from insect cells expressing all possible combinations of its four constituent subunits permitted resolution of its hierarchical subunit organization. This analysis revealed that MED12 binds to Cyclin C, which in turn binds to CDK8 (Fig. 3A; Fig. S2A). MED12 also binds to MED13, which does not bind to either Cyclin C or CDK8 (Fig. 3A; Fig. S2A and B). Importantly, we did not detect an interaction between MED12 and CDK8 in the absence of Cyclin C (Fig. 3A; Figs. S2A and S2C), indicating that Cyclin C bridges MED12 and CDK8. These findings confirm those recently described for subunit assembly in S. cerevisiae and support a conserved molecular organization between the yeast and human kinase modules (Tsai et al., 2013).  Figure 3 Figure 3 The Cyclin C surface groove is required for MED12 binding and CDK8 activation. (A) Schematic summary of binding interactions within the Mediator kinase module. (B) Structure of H. sapiens Cyclin C-CDK8 (25) (PDBID: 3RGF). Cyclin C, blue: CDK8, gray. Targeted ... To understand how MED12 binds to Cyclin C, we exploited information derived from prior structural resolution of both S. pombe and H. sapiens Cyclin C proteins (Hoeppner et al., 2005; Schneider et al., 2011). These structures reveal the presence of a unique surface groove that is phylogenetically conserved among Cyclin C family members, but absent from cell cycle-type cyclins (Fig. 3B). We hypothesized that this surface groove could represent a binding interface through which MED12 stimulates Cyclin C-dependent CDK8 kinase activity. To test this hypothesis, we introduced substitution mutations at residues both within (W177A, N181A, D182A, Y238A) and outside of (W6A, E98A) the structurally defined Cyclin C surface groove (Fig. 3B), and examined their impact on MED12 binding and CDK8 activation. Accordingly, CDK8-specific immunoprecipitates from insect cells co-expressing CDK8, MED12, and either WT or mutant Cyclin C derivatives were examined for both the presence of MED12 and the level of CDK8 kinase activity. Three surface groove mutants (N181A, D182A, Y238A), but no mutant outside the groove, diminished MED12 binding and CDK8 kinase activity (Fig. 3C) without affecting CDK8 binding. These results identify the Cyclin C surface groove as a principal binding interface through which MED12 activates CDK8, and further reveal that MED12 and CDK8 bind to Cyclin C through distinct surfaces.  To confirm these findings in vivo, we expressed FLAG-tagged WT Cyclin C or its MED12 binding-deficient mutant derivative (N181A) in HEK293 cells and monitored their chromatographic elution profiles by gel filtration analysis. Whereas wild-type Cyclin C co-eluted along with other Mediator subunits in a ∼2 MDa Mediator peak, Cyclin C N181A was excluded entirely from these fractions (Fig. S3A and B), indicating that surface groove mutations disrupt the association of Cyclin C with MED12, its principal anchor in Mediator. This interpretation is congruent with co-immunoprecipitation analyses from FLAG-tagged WT and mutant Cyclin C expressing cells. FLAG-specific immunoprecipitates from N181A and D182A-expressing cells harbored CDK8, but not MED12 or other Mediator subunits that were readily detected in those from WT and E98A-expressing cells (Fig. 3D). Concordantly, Cyclin C-associated CDK8 kinase activity was significantly reduced in FLAG-specific immunoprecipitates from cells expressing N181A and D182A compared to WT or E98A derivatives (Fig. 3D). Together, these results identify the Cyclin C surface groove as a principal binding interface through which MED12 both anchors Cyclin C-CDK8 into Mediator and stimulates Cyclin C-dependent CDK8 kinase activity.  Our findings that oncogenic exon 2 mutations in MED12 uncouple Cyclin C-CDK8/19 from core Mediator implicate aberrant CDK8/19 activity in uterine leiomyomagenesis and suggests new potential targets for therapeutic intervention in a tumor type that negatively impacts hundreds of millions of women worldwide. Because CDK8 and CDK19 are both expressed in normal myometrium (and leiomyomas), it is not presently clear to what extent the oncogenic potential of MED12 mutations derive from disruption of Mediator associated CDK8 versus CDK19 activity. Further studies will be necessary to address this important issue. Our findings further clarify the network of molecular interactions required for Mediator kinase activity and identify the MED12/Cyclin C interface as a prospective therapeutic target in CDK8-driven cancers.  Go to: Experimental Procedures Cloning and mutagenesis for the MED12 Flp-In™ 293 T-REx cells  Site-directed mutagenesis of MED12 to generate the G44D mutant was performed using the primers listed in Table S3. After mutagenesis the cDNA constructs were cloned into gateway compatible entry-vector and finally to pTO_HA_StrepIII_c_GW_FRT destination vector (Varjosalo et al., 2013).  Affinity purification  For each individual pulldown, a cell pellet derived from 5 × 15 cm dishes (approximately 5 × 107 cells) was lysed for 10 min on ice in 5 mL HNN lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 50 mM NaF, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 1.0 mM PMSF and 10 μL/mL protease inhibitor cocktail, Sigma). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. 200 μL Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads (400 μL slurry) were transferred to a Bio-Spin chromatography column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 3 × 1 mL HNN buffer and 3 × 1 mL HNN buffer without detergent and inhibitors, and bound proteins eluted with 3 × 300 μL freshly-prepared 0.5 mM D-biotin (Thermo Scientific) in HNN buffer into a fresh 1.5 ml eppendorf tube.  Mass spectrometry  Samples were prepared for LC-MS as follows: DTT was added to the eluates to a final concentration of 10 mM and the samples incubated for 1 h at 56°C. To block cysteine residues, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 55 mM and the samples incubated at RT in the dark for 30 min. 1 μg trypsin was added and the samples were incubated overnight at 37°C. Tryptic digests were quenched with 10% TFA, concentrated and purified by reverse-phase chromatography MicroSpin™ Column (C18, Nest Group) and eluted with 90% CH3CN, 0.1% TFA. The volume of the eluted sample was reduced to approximately 2 μL in a vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted to a final volume of 40 μl with 0.1% TFA, 1% CH3CN and vortexed thoroughly.  Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on an Orbitrap Elite ETD mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) using the Xcalibur version 2.7.1 coupled to an Thermo Scientific nLCII nanoflow system (ThermoScientific) via a nanoelectrospray ion source. Solvents for LCMS separation of the digested samples were as follows: solvent A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (98%) and acetonitrile (2%) and solvent B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (98%) and water (2%). From a thermostatted microautosampler, 8 μl of the tryptic peptide mixture (corresponding to 20% of the final SH-TAP eluate) were automatically loaded onto a 15 cm fused silica analytical column with an inner diameter of 75 μm packed with C18 reversed phase material (Thermo Scientific) and the peptides were eluted from the analytical column with a 40 minute gradient ranging from 5 to 35% solvent B, followed by a 10 minute gradient from 35 to 80% solvent B at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min. The analyses were performed in a data dependent acquisition mode using a top 10 collision-induced dissociation (CID) method. Dynamic exclusion for selected ions was 30 seconds. No lock masses were employed. Maximal ion accumulation time allowed on the Orbitrap Elite ETD in CID mode was 100 ms for MSn in the Ion Trap and 200 ms in the FTMS. Automatic gain control was used to prevent overfilling of the ion traps and were set to 10,000 (CID) in MSn mode for the Ion Trap, and 106 ions for a full FTMS scan. Intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at 60,000 resolution. Peak extraction and subsequent protein identification was achieved using Proteome Discoverer software (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Calibrated peak files were searched against the human component of UniProtKB/SwissProt database (www.uniprot.org) by a SEQUEST search engine. Error tolerances on the precursor and fragment ions were ±15 ppm and ±0.6 Da, respectively. Database searches were limited to fully-tryptic peptides with maximum 1 missed cleavage, carbamidomethyl cysteine and methionine oxidation were set as fixed and variable modifications, respectively.  The normalization of protein abundance is described in Table S1.  Kinase assays  For in vitro kinase assays, insect cell lysates expressing MED12-HA (WT or mutants), CDK8-FLAG, and CycCH6 (WT or mutants) were combined in different combinations and subjected to FLAG IP for 1 hour, at 4°C in 200mM NaCl D Buffer. Immune complexes were washed in 200mM NaCl D buffer and subjected to a kinase assay containing 25mM Tris pH7.5, 20mM MgCl2, 2.5mCi [γ-32P]-ATP and 2μg of purified GST-3X-CTD. Reactions were incubated for 30 minutes at 30°C, eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, processed by SDS-12% PAGE, stained with Coomassie blue and visualized by phosphorimager analysis. 32P-labeled GST-3XCTD was quantified using ImageQuant software.  For in vivo derived kinase assays, HEK293 cells were transfected with pCDNA3.1-3xFLAG Cyclin C (WT or mutant) or 3xFLAG MED12 (WT or mutant) plasmids and nuclear extracts were harvested 48 hours later. Extracts were subjected to FLAG IP in 200mM D buffer overnight at 4°C. Immune complexes were washed and subjected to a kinase assay containing 25mM Tris pH7.5, 20mM MgCl2, 2.5mCi [γ-32P]-ATP and 2μg of purified GST-3X-CTD. Reactions were incubated for 30 minutes at 30°C, eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, processed by SDS-12% PAGE, stained with Coomassie stain and visualized by phosphorimager analysis. 32P-labeled GST-3X-CTD levels were quantified using ImageQuant software.  ​ Highlights  MED12 indirectly activates CDK8 by binding to a conserved surface groove on Cyclin C Uterine leiomyoma mutations in MED12 disrupt the MED12-Cyclin C interface in Mediator Uterine leiomyoma mutations in MED12 uncouple Cyclin C-CDK8/19 from core Mediator
