121||The RNA maturation is an important and complex biological process. It requires several small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that comprise the two forms of spliceosomes. The major form of spliceosome (U2-type) is composed of U1, U2, U4/6 and U5 snRNPs, and catalyzes most splicing events in metazoans.1  Mutations of genes, such as SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and to a lesser extent SF1, SF3A1, U2AF2 or PRPF40B, encoding spliceosome compounds have been found to occur at high frequencies in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).2, 3, 4 Subsequently, SF3B1 mutations were also found in solid tumors such as endometrial, lung, bladder, pancreatic and breast carcinomas and cutaneous melanomas.5 We and others also reported that 15–20% of uveal melanoma (UM) carry SF3B1 mutations.6, 7, 8 SF3B1 (splicing factor 3 B subunit 1, also named SF3B155) is a central compound the U2 snRNP complex in direct contact with the branch site of the pre-mRNA. SF3B1 contains 22 HEAT repeats (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, Targets of rapamycin 1). Major hotspots of missense mutations of SF3B1 target one of the HEAT repeats at positions R625, K666 and K700, with variability according to diseases, R625 and K700 mutations being the most prevalent in UM and hematologic disorders, respectively. Prognosis value of these mutations vary according to diseases, SF3B1 mutations are associated with poor outcomes in CLL and favorable outcomes in UM.9 SF3B1 mutations are especially associated with the refractory anemia with excess of ring sideroblasts (RARS), a mild form of MDS with little impact on patient’s survival. Consequences of these mutations on splicing are less clear. Aberrant splicing associated with SF3B1 was reported by two landmark publications.2, 3 However, little overlap was found between MDS and CLL. Furthermore, Harbour et al.6 found no splicing effect of SF3B1 mutations in a series of UM patients analyzed by RNA-seq. By combining exon array and RNA-seq analyzes, we recently reported alternative transcripts of eight genes statistically associated with SF3B1 R625 mutations and linked to various RNA processing mechanisms: alternative terminal exons (UQCC, ADAM12, GAS8), alternative 3′ acceptor splice sites (CRNDE, ANKHD1), alternative cassette exons (GUSBP1), alternative first exon (F8) and intron retention (ABCC5).7  Five of these differential splicing events (CRNDE, GUSBP11, UQCC, ABCC5 and ANKHD1) were most consistently associated with the SF3B1-mutated status. Here we explored whether this splicing signature was also associated with SF3B1 mutations in malignancies other than UM, namely in MDS and CLL.  Series of CLL (26 cases), MDS of various subtypes (48 cases) and UM (87 cases) were assembled. These samples were genotyped for the recurrent mutated genes of the spliceosome, and biological and clinical data were obtained (see Supplementary Table for sample characteristics). After RNA extraction and reverse transcription, samples were analyzed for the two splice forms of UQCC, CRNDE, ANKHD1, GUSBP1 and ABCC5 by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) as described previously.7 CRNDE was poorly expressed in CLL, below the detection sensitivity of the RT-QPCR in most cases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied on the splicing ratio of the five expressed genes obtained for the series of MDS and CLL data, as well as with that of the series of UM previously reported.7 Whereas no disease aggregation was observed in the clustering, all SF3B1-mutated samples clustered in a single branch (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table for complete sample status). More specifically, this group of samples included 8 CLL SF3B1-mutated samples (K700E (6), K666T (1) and G742D (1)), 24 MDS SF3B1-mutated sample cases (K700E (14), H622Q (4), D781G (2), R625L/H/D/C (4)) and 19 SF3B1-mutated UM samples (R625H/C/L/P (16), K666M/T (2), K700E (1)). As expected, most SF3B1-mutated MDS were classified as RARS or refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) (16 and 4, respectively out of 23 cases). No SF3B1-mutated samples were misclassified, except one MDS sample, MDS44 and one UM case, UM48, with low but detectable frequencies of mutated SF3B1 allele, which segregated with wild-type cases. Five cases without detected splicesome mutations (one MDS, two UM and two CLL) clustered in this branch corresponding to the mutated samples. The three SRSF2-mutated MDS cases, bearing the P95H hotspot mutation, segregated in the second branch with the wild-type samples, suggesting that this mutant-splicing factor differently affects the splicing process than the SF3B1 mutants. Two MDS samples bearing ZRSR2 missense mutations of unknown functional consequences (K413E and V304M) segregated each in a different branch.  Figure 1.

An unsupervised hierarchical clustering and a heatmap are performed using the difference in Ct (threshold cycle) between the two splicing forms expression for the five genes, measured by RT-QPCR for a series of 161 tumor samples representing 3 pathologies: uveal melanoma (UM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Data were normalized on mean and standard deviation within each pathology and research center. Clustering was performed based on Euclidian distance by Ward’s method.

NA, not available.  Full figure and legend (124K)  Several conclusions could be drawn from these results. First, it is the first time that consistent splicing abnormalities are associated with SF3B1 mutations. The fact that the same splicing pattern is observed in tumor cells from different lineages and embryonic origins, strongly argues for a direct consequence of SF3B1 mutation. Second, the same pattern is observed irrespective of the mutated HEAT repeats of SF3B1. The reason for different hotspot mutations in different malignancies is largely unexplained but no different consequence was detected in the limited splicing events explored here. Third, the other mutated spliceosome compounds present in our series, including SRSF2 and ZRSR2, did not share the splicing abnormalities of the SF3B1 mutants. Finally, while no false negative was present in the clustering, the splicing pattern of 5 out of 161 samples from the three series was undistinguishable from that of SF3B1 samples, suggesting either experimental limitation of our splicing analysis or undetected abnormalities of the splicing machinery.  Our data clearly associate specific splicing abnormalities to SF3B1 mutations but these abnormalities are most probably not limited to those analyzed here. To statistically demonstrate splicing variants among more than 200 000 different splicing events remains challenging. It requires reliable molecular tools such as the latest generation of exon array or RNA-seq, efficient bioinformatics and large series of cases. It is thus likely that only the most consistent events were picked by the analysis of a limited number of mutated cases. Splicing forms yet to be discovered may better explain the oncogenic pathways activated by mutant SF3B1. Finally, our results do not rule out functions of SF3B1 besides splicing, which deregulations could intervene in oncogenesis.   Graphical Abstract Image for unlabelled figure Figure options  Introduction RNA splicing, a highly regulated molecular event orchestrated by the spliceosome, involves the removal of intronic sequences from pre-mRNA and the ligation of exons to generate mature mRNA (Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009). This process can result in multiple mRNAs being produced from a single gene providing increased protein diversity in cells. Dysregulation of RNA splicing has been identified as a causative defect in several diseases (Dehm, 2013 ;  Singh and Cooper, 2012). Furthermore, dysregulated alternative splicing has been proposed to play an important role in tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy; however, in many cases, the molecular consequences of dysregulated splicing in cancer have remained largely elusive (Zhang and Manley, 2013). Recently, recurrent heterozygous mutations were identified in components of the spliceosome in various tumor types suggesting that somatic mutations in spliceosome genes play an important role in cancer (Yoshida and Ogawa, 2014). SF3B1 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene with particular enrichment in diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, uveal melanoma (UVM), skin melanoma (SKCM), and breast (BRCA) and pancreatic cancers ( Biankin et al., 2012; Ellis et al., 2012; Harbour et al., 2013; Kong et al., 2014; Landau et al., 2013; Malcovati et al., 2015 ;  Yoshida et al., 2011). Based on the high frequency of SF3B1 mutations and the key role in splicing of this protein, we sought to study the molecular and functional consequences of SF3B1 hotspot mutations on RNA splicing in cell lines and patient samples.  Splicing takes place after the recognition of consensus sequences near the 5′ and 3′ ends of introns, known as 5′ and 3′ splice sites (ss), by the splicing machinery. U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) recognizes the 5′ ss, whereas U2 snRNP is directed to the appropriate 3′ ss by short, conserved pre-mRNA sequences, including a branch point sequence (BPS), the polypyrimidine (Py) tract, and the AG dinucleotide at the intron-exon junction. Prior to U2 snRNP recruitment, SF1 recognizes the BPS, the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) large subunit (U2AF2) recognizes the Py tract, and U2AF small subunit (U2AF1) recognizes the AG dinucleotide. Subsequently, the U2 snRNP replaces SF1 in an ATP-dependent process that facilitates protein and RNA rearrangements. In particular, the N terminus of SF3B1, a U2 snRNP component, has been shown to bind with U2AF2, whereas the SF3B1 C terminus along with another U2 snRNP component, p14, interacts with the BPS and nearby pre-mRNA sequences (Gozani et al., 1998). In addition, U2 snRNP and pre-mRNA complex is stabilized by a base-paired duplex between the U2 snRNA and the BPS. The subsequent binding of U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP induces structural rearrangements that lead to activation of two catalytic steps that generate the lariat intermediate and subsequent final exon-exon product (Horowitz, 2012; Matera and Wang, 2014 ;  Wahl et al., 2009).  The recurrent hotspot mutations in SF3B1 are found exclusively in the C-terminal HEAT domains (residues 622–781; Figure S1A). Though there has been lack of structural information on how SF3B1 interacts with pre-mRNA, previous cryo-electron microscopy studies suggest that SF3B1 may undergo a conformational change to a more open form that enables mRNA binding and BPS recognition by the U2 snRNP (Golas et al., 2003). Although it was previously reported by several groups that SF3B1 mutant-positive cancers are associated with aberrant splicing (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013), here, we show that SF3B1 hotspot mutations (SF3B1MUT) result in neomorphic activity causing aberrant splicing. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ ss selection through the use of a branch point (BP) different from the BP utilized by SF3B1 wild-type (SF3B1WT) and that SF3B1MUT still requires the canonical Py tract for the formation of the active spliceosome to induce aberrant splicing. We predict that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced mRNAs are subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that multiple aberrant transcripts are degraded, resulting in downregulation of the associated canonical protein in cell line models and patient samples. These insights into the splicing aberrations induced by SF3B1MUT will enable discovery of downstream consequences that contribute to neoplasms and the discovery of targeted therapeutic approaches for SF3B1MUT cancers.  Results SF3B1MUT Tumor-Specific Splicing Defects  To provide a more complete understanding of the splicing aberrations observed in SF3B1MUT cancers, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from different tumor types were analyzed using a bioinformatic pipeline that we developed in order to quantify exon-exon junctions without the need of predetermined alternative splicing models or annotated splice junctions. The analysis pipeline was applied to CLL patient samples (7 SF3B1MUT and 6 SF3B1WT) and a number of samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas: luminal A primary BRCA (7 SF3B1K700E and 14 SF3B1WT), SKCM (3 SF3B1MUT and 12 SF3B1WT), and UVM (18 SF3B1MUT and 18 SF3B1WT) (Table S1). This analysis revealed 895 aberrant splice junctions to be significantly upregulated in SF3B1MUT compared to SF3B1WT of which 534 events (∼60%) were unique as they had not been previously annotated in major transcriptome databases. The majority of aberrant splicing events observed were aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures 1A and S1B; Table S2), consistent with previous observations (DeBoever et al., 2015; Furney et al., 2013; Gentien et al., 2014 ;  Landau et al., 2013).

Box plots and whiskers are represented as per the Tukey method. See also Figure S1 and Tables S2 and S3. Figure options Unsupervised clustering was applied to the identified aberrant junctions and it led to clustering of SF3B1MUT samples distinct from the cluster of SF3B1WT samples (Figure 1B), with the exception of two SF3B1MUT samples (TCGA-D8-A1JH and TCGA-ER-A19S) that clustered with the SF3B1WT samples. This was likely driven by low mutant allele fractions (7% and 14%, respectively) when compared with a range of 25%–52% for other samples (Figure 1B; Table S2). Moreover, samples with SF3B1MUT clustered within each tumor type (BRCA, SKCM, UVM, and CLL), each showing a set of unique aberrantly spliced junctions (Figures 1B and S1C). A set of “common” events (i.e., events found in all tumor types) were observed, consistent with a small overlap of splicing abnormalities found in CLL and UVM described in two previous reports (Furney et al., 2013). The pattern of tumor-specific splicing in BRCA and CLL could, at least in part, be explained by the increased expression of the genes that are aberrantly spliced in these tumor types compared to the other diseases (p = 7.5022 × 10−05 and p = 1.0078 × 10−36, respectively); however, the same was not observed for SKCM and UVM (Figure 1C; Table S3). This suggests that additional mechanisms, such as tissue-specific splicing regulation, might contribute to these patterns.  Using the aberrant junctions identified in the previous analysis, we extended the clustering analysis to include 14 MDS RARS samples (12 SF3B1MUT) and an additional 19 samples from TCGA with miscellaneous SF3B1 mutations (Table S1). For the MDS samples, relatively low sequencing depth and inclusion of just two SF3B1WT samples precluded their use for the discovery of MDS-specific aberrant junctions. While all SF3B1MUT MDS patients and three BRCA patients (p.N626D, p.D781E, and p.K666E) clustered with the original SF3B1MUT sample set, 16 SF3B1 mutant patients clustered with SF3B1WT samples (Figure S1D). These patient samples carried mutations in SF3B1 (“Non-hotspot” in Figure S1D and Table S1) that are not co-localized with the hotspot mutations in the HEAT domain. These analyses strongly suggest a convergence of mechanism and downstream splicing effects induced by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1 Mutations Induce Aberrant mRNA Splicing in Human and Mouse Cells  To study SF3B1MUT in vitro, a pancreatic cancer cell line carrying endogenous SF3B1 mutations (Panc05.04: p.Q699H and p.K700E) was utilized. In addition, the p.K700E, p.K666N, or p.H662Q mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E, Nalm-6 SF3B1K666N, Nalm-6 SF3B1H662Q) or a synonymous mutation (Nalm-6 SF3B1K700K, referred as SF3B1WT) was introduced by AAV-mediated homology to the Nalm-6 pre-B cell line to produce isogenic matched cell lines. Unsupervised clustering of these cell lines and a panel of several SF3B1WT pancreatic cancer cell lines using the aberrant splice junctions identified in patient samples resulted in clear segregation of SF3B1MUT cell lines from SF3B1WT cells (Figure 2A). A similar increase in aberrant splice junctions observed in RNA-seq data analysis was confirmed in Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells using a Nanostring assay developed to quantify aberrant splice junctions (Figure S2A). Panc05.04 cells carry the hotspot mutation p.K700E and a mutation at position 699 (p.Q699H) that is not observed in patient samples. When the p.Q699H and p.K700E were expressed alone or in combination in 293FT cells, only cells expressing p.K700E and p.Q699H/p.K700E induced aberrant splicing indicating that p.Q699H does not appear to affect this aberrant 3′ ss selection (Figures S2B and S2C). These data confirm that Panc05.04 and Nalm-6 SF3B1MUT cell lines are representative models to study the splicing functional activity of SF3B1MUT in vitro.

Data are represented as mean of three biological replicates. Data are presented in box plots as boxes in the first and third quartiles, midline as the median, and whiskers extending to the range excluding outliers. See also Figure S2. Figure options To confirm that additional cancer-associated SF3B1 hotspot mutations induced aberrant splicing, we expressed various mxSF3B1MUT, mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R in 293FT cells (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for a description of mxSF3B1; Figure S2D) and analyzed splicing aberrations by Nanostring. The p.K700R mutation served as a negative control as it doesn’t introduce a major change in charge or size of the amino acid and is not disease associated. All SF3B1MUT tested demonstrated the same usage of aberrant splice sites observed in endogenous and engineered cell lines; however, the SF3B1K700R or SF3B1WT did not show these splicing changes (Figure 2B). Moreover, the expression of any of the SF3B1 constructs did not change the overall expression (sum of aberrant and canonical) of affected genes (Figure 2B). To further confirm the correlation between expression of SF3B1 p.K700E mutation and aberrant splicing, tetracycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to selectively knockdown (KD) the SF3B1MUT or SF3B1WT allele in Panc05.04 and Panc10.05 (SF3B1MUT and SF3B1WT cells). After confirmation of KD efficiency (Figures S2E–S2H), RNA isolated from treated cells was analyzed by Nanostring. Depletion of the SF3B1MUT allele in Panc05.04 resulted in downregulation of aberrant splice isoforms, whereas an accumulation of aberrant splice isoforms was observed with selective SF3B1WT allele depletion (Figures 2C and 2D), indicating that SF3B1MUT was responsible for the appearance of aberrant splicing. These results were also supported by the expression of a pan shRNA or depletion of SF3B1WT in the Panc10.05 where no effect on aberrant splicing was observed (Figures 2C and 2D). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT acquires a neomorphic function and may also lose wild-type splicing activity. This observation was also supported by the recent paper by Zhou et al. proposing that in a different SF3B1 mutant cell line (ESS1) wild-type SF3B1 was required for survival (Zhou et al., 2015).  SF3B1MUT Recognizes a Cryptic 3′ AG with a Short and Weak Py Tract  The most common splicing abnormality observed in SF3B1MUT cells was the usage of an aberrant 3′ ss. To understand the sequence features and the mechanism by which mutant SF3B1 would induce aberrant splicing, computational analysis of SF3B1MUT patient data and minigene assay validation methods were utilized. First, an enrichment of the cryptic AGs was determined to be located between −15 and −24 nt upstream of the canonical 3′ ss in SF3B1MUT patient samples (Figure 3A). In contrast, the first AG (but not GAG) upstream of a canonical AG in RefSeq showed a much lower density in this region and a wider distribution. Interestingly, the motif sequences associated with the cryptic and canonical AGs showed several different features. Upstream of the canonical AGs, a clear enrichment of pyrimidines was observed in agreement with the presence of a Py tract, whereas the cryptic AGs were associated with a short and weak Py tract and an enrichment of adenines (A) that are possibly important for BPS selection. In contrast, no clear features were associated with the first upstream AGs in RefSeq (Figures 3B and S3). Interestingly, similar features, such as the position of cryptic AG between −15 and −24, the presence of a short and weak Py tract, and an enrichment of As were observed in aberrant 3′ spliced junctions detected in NIH 3T3 mouse cells overexpressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures S4A–S4C). While similar features associated with aberrant splice junction usage were observed in mxSF3B1K700E mouse cells, the overlap of affected junctions observed in human cells was low due to low sequence similarity of introns between species (Figure S4D; Table S4). An exception was observed for the UXS1 gene for which the junction between exon 2 and exon 3 is conserved among different species ( Figure S4E). These data strongly suggest that SF3B1MUT induces aberrant splicing in the presence of competing 3′ ss via a sequence-dependent feature located within the intron and preferentially recognizes cryptic splice sites with weaker Py tract in close proximity to an enrichment of As.

Shown here is a representative ethidium-bromide-stained 2.5% agarose gel of the indicated RT-PCR reactions of mRNA isolated from transfected cells. See also Figures S4 and S5 and Table S4. Figure options To confirm the importance of these specific sequence features, we selected the exon 9/exon 10 junction in ZDHHC16 to develop a minigene as it was observed to be aberrantly spliced among all the SF3B1 hotspot mutant samples analyzed. In addition, several alterations in the cryptic 3′ ss, the length/strength of the Py tracts, and the potential BPS were tested ( Figure S5A). Splicing was assessed by RT-PCR using cDNA prepared from 293FT cells co-transfected with ZDHHC16 minigene and mxSF3B1 plasmid. As expected, when the ZDHHC16 exon 9, intron 9 and exon 10 (E9-I9-E10) minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, only canonical splicing was observed, whereas in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E and all the other hotspot mutations, both canonical and aberrant splicing was detected (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 4 and 5; Figure S5B). Interestingly, once the cryptic AG was removed (E9-I9NoAG-E10), aberrant splicing was not observed even in cells expressing mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that the cryptic AG is necessary for aberrant splicing. To understand whether exonic sequences play a role in aberrant splicing, we looked at the preceding junction in ZDHHC16 (E8-I8-E9). As expected, no aberrant splicing was observed when this minigene was co-transfected with any of the mxSF3B1 constructs (Figure 3D, lanes 10 and 11). Canonical and aberrant splicing was detected when intron 8 between exon 8 and 9 was replaced with intron 9 (E8-I9-E9) in the ZDHHC16 minigene and co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, but not when co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R (Figure 3D, lanes 12 and 13). These results agree with the computational analysis suggesting that the cryptic AG is necessary and the intronic features are sufficient to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  Identification of the 3′ ss occurs during early assembly of the spliceosome, in particular when the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex recognizes the Py tract and AG, and then again when the AG is recognized during the second step of splicing (Horowitz, 2012). To understand if the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is sufficient to recruit the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex, the length/strength of the canonical Py tract was reduced from 19 nt to 10, 6, and 2 nt (PyT 10n, PyT 6n, and PyT 2n, respectively) or the weak and short cryptic Py tract was replaced with a strong Py tract (SELEX) (Figure S5A) (Lim et al., 2011). When the minigene PyT 2n (or PyT 10n and PyT 6n, in Figure S5C) was co-transfected with the mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, the splicing event occurred with selection of a new cryptic 3′ ss within exon 10 positioned 54 nt downstream of the canonical 3′ ss (sequencing data not shown), suggesting that the PyT 2n was not recognized by U2AF complex (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15; Figure S5C). This is in agreement with previous reports suggesting that Py tract length and strength are necessary for the recruitment of U2AF2/U2AF1 to guide splicing to occur at that position (Coolidge et al., 1997). Surprisingly, when the same minigenes were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, similar results were observed and splicing occurred within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 14 and 15), suggesting that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is not sufficient to recruit the U2AF complex and that the cryptic AG requires the downstream canonical Py tract to induce aberrant splicing. The nucleotide base upstream of the AG dinucleotide has been reported to be critical for U2AF1 interaction in early recognition of 3′ ss and is usually a T/C in consensus sequences (Ilagan et al., 2015). Hence, introduction of a G upstream of the canonical or cryptic AG (−3 T > G or −24 C > G) would potentially abolish their use as a 3′ ss, respectively. When −3 T > G minigene was co-transfected with either mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E constructs, splicing was observed within exon 10, similar to PyT 2n, suggesting again that the U2AF2/U2AF1 complex needs to be recruited at the canonical AG during first step of splicing to allow usage of the cryptic AG by SF3B1MUT (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 16 and 17). Interestingly, when −24 C > G minigene was used, only canonical splicing was observed, even after mxSF3B1K700E expression (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 8 and 9). These data suggest that the −3 position relative to cryptic AG is also important when the cryptic 3′ ss is recognized during the second transesterification reaction of splicing. Moreover, when the short and weak cryptic Py tract was replaced with a SELEX Py tract, the cryptic AG was used as the preferred 3′ ss by cells expressing both mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700E (Figures 3C and 3D, lanes 18 and 19). Taken together, these data support the notion that the sequence features required by SF3B1MUT-containing U2 snRNP complex are located within the intron and that the cryptic AG and the downstream canonical Py tract are required to induce aberrant splicing by SF3B1MUT.  SF3B1MUT Utilizes a Different BPS  The computational analysis of motifs near the 3′ ss showed an enrichment of As upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse mutant SF3B1 cells, suggesting the importance of this sequence for the SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 complex. DeBoever and colleagues suggested that these were the BPSs for the mutant and wild-type SF3B1 complexes using a BPS prediction algorithm (DeBoever et al., 2015). Instead, we used the recently mapped BPS data using K562 SF3B1WT cells and overlaid these data with introns in which the aberrant splice junctions were observed in SF3B1MUT cells (Mercer et al., 2015). A total of 151 BPs were mapped among 93 introns; 60 introns have only one identified BP, and another 33 introns contain multiple reported BPs. The distribution of these BPs with respect to the cryptic AG indicated that the majority of BPs overlapped with the A of the cryptic AG or were in close proximity (between 1, cryptic A and −5), but did not coincide with the enrichment of As observed in the motif analysis (Figure 4A). The enrichment of As was observed between −8 and −18 nt upstream of the cryptic AG in human and mouse cells expressing mutant SF3B1 (Figures 4B and S4C). This suggests that these As could play an important role for SF3B1MUT function. To test this hypothesis, the 3 As located between −33 and −35 were mutated to Gs in the ZDHHC16 minigene (−33 to −35 AAA > GGG; Figure 4C and S5A). When this minigene was co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT and mxSF3B1K700R, canonical splicing was observed, suggesting that these As are not part of the BPS for wild-type U2 complex (Figure 4D, lanes 11 and 12). Instead, when the cells were co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, canonical splicing was observed without any aberrant splicing, indicating that the three As are probably part of the BPS used by the U2 mutant complex (Figure 4D, lane 12). To identify the BPS used by the U2 wild-type complex, the A at position −26 and −30 alone or together were mutated to G (−26 A > G, −30 A > G and −26, −30 AA > GG; Figure 4C). When the A at position −26 alone or both −26 and −30 were mutated to G and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R, splicing was observed within exon 10 at the new cryptic 3′ ss (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10), suggesting that this is likely the BPS for SF3B1WT, but not for SF3B1K700E, as canonical and aberrant splicing was observed in these conditions (Figure 4D, lanes 5, 6 and 9, 10). Interestingly, when the minigene with the A at position −30 alone was mutated to G (Figure 4C and S5A) and co-transfected with mxSF3B1WT or mxSF3B1K700R splicing was observed mostly within exon 10 and when co-transfected with mxSF3B1K700E, only aberrant splicing was observed (Figure 4D, lanes 7 and 8). As expected, when all the As were mutated to Gs (all A > G, Figures 4C and S5A), each mxSF3B1 construct spliced within exon 10 (Figure 4D, lanes 13 and 14). Additionally, this outcome was confirmed by mapping the two different BPs using nested PCR analysis and sequencing of endogenous ZDHHC16 intron 9 lariat in K562 isogenic cells ( Figure 4E). Unlike in SF3B1WT cells, we observed at least two major templates with different sequences in the SF3B1K700E cells due to a mixed population of SF3B1WT and SF3B1MUT proteins. Through analysis and matching of expected transcript sequences using Mutation Surveyor, we found that −34 A and −30 A were the BPs used for SF3B1K700E and SF3B1WT, respectively. To extend our observation, we also mapped BPs in four additional genes that are aberrantly spliced in presence of SF3B1K700E: TMEM14C (intron 1), SEPT6 (intron 9), DLST (intron 5), and DIP2A (intron 23) ( Table S5). These results prove that the SF3B1 wild-type and mutant-containing U2 complexes are able to use two different BPs.  SF3B1MUT Uses a Different BPS than SF3B1WT(A) Relative positions of mapped BP ...

Figure options Aberrant Transcripts Generated by SF3B1MUT Are Subjected to NMD  Erroneous or aberrant mRNAs that contain a premature termination codon are subjected to NMD to prevent potential deleterious effects of their translation to proteins (Kervestin and Jacobson, 2012). Computational analysis revealed that the majority of cryptic AGs were located upstream of canonical 3′ ss at nucleotide distances that were not multiples of 3 (Figure 5A). This result suggested that the aberrant transcripts would have a higher probability to be out of frame and therefore degraded by NMD. To confirm that predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts were degraded by the NMD pathway, RNA-seq was performed on Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cells treated with cycloheximide, a translation inhibitor known to inhibit NMD (Singh et al., 2012). Bioinformatic prediction analysis revealed that 44% of all aberrant mRNAs identified in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E cell lines would result in an NMD-sensitive transcript (Rivas et al., 2015) (Figure 5B; Tables S6 and S7). RNA-seq analysis from Nalm-6 isogenic cells demonstrated that NMD-sensitive genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E than Nalm-6 SF3B1WT (p = 1.06 × 10−12), whereas predicted NMD-insensitive genes were expressed at similar levels (Figure 5C). RNA-seq analysis identified 41 predicted NMD-sensitive genes to be both downregulated in Nalm-6 SF3B1K700E and to have increased abundance following cycloheximide treatment (Figure 5D; Table S6), suggesting that these aberrant transcripts were degraded by the NMD. In addition, to evaluate if this would result in downregulation of the associated canonical protein, stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) with subsequent mass spectrometry was used to quantify protein levels in Nalm-6 isogenic lines (Oda et al., 1999)· Eleven predicted NMD-sensitive transcripts for which peptides could be detected in Nalm-6 SF3B1WT were selected for evaluation, and ten were found to have decreased peptide counts by at least 2- to 8-fold (e.g., ABCB7, AKAP8L; Figure 6A). Decreased expression of canonical proteins was confirmed by western blot analysis using available antibodies, such as MZB1, PHGDH, and SEPT6 (Figure 6B). Among the downregulated proteins in the SILAC experiment were two proteins of particular interest: MZB1 and ABCB7. MZB1 is a B cell-specific and ER-localized protein implicated in antibody secretion and integrin-mediated cell adhesion (van Anken et al., 2009). As shown in Figure 6C, MZB1 was aberrantly spliced in SF3B1K700E cells and the canonical isoform was clearly downregulated at transcript and protein level (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6D). As shown in Figure 6E, clear downregulation of canonical MZB1 protein level was also observed in four out of five CLL patients with SF3B1MUT, but not in SF3B1WT samples. The result for patient 8 could be explained by the low allele fraction for Y623C (10%), and this was associated with undetectable aberrant splicing for ZDHHC16 and no change in canonical MZB1 when compared with one of the SF3B1WT patients (Figure S6). ABCB7 is a mediator of iron accumulation and erythroid growth and has been reported to be downregulated specifically in an MDS subtype characterized by refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (Boultwood et al., 2008). Interestingly, SF3B1 mutations have been found at a frequency of 80%–90% in RARS, but not in other MDS subtypes (Papaemmanuil et al., 2011). In addition, a partial loss-of-function mutation in ABCB7 has been identified in X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia demonstrating an iron-overload phenotype in cells with defective ABCB7 (Allikmets et al., 1999). We identified that ABCB7 is aberrantly spliced in SF3B1 mutant cells (Figure 6F) and demonstrated that the aberrant transcript is subject to NMD, causing downregulation of the canonical transcript and protein (Figures 6A and 6D). Therefore, aberrant splicing and subsequent NMD of ABCB7 likely explains the association between ABCB7 downregulation observed in RARS and the presence of SF3B1 mutants. Taken together, these data suggest that SF3B1MUT might contribute to the phenotypes observed in diseases by inducing the generation of NMD-sensitive transcripts through aberrant splicing and to a subsequent reduction in the levels of the corresponding proteins.  44% of All Aberrantly Spliced Genes Are Putative Targets of NMD(A) Frequency of ...

See also Figure S6. Figure options Discussion In the current study, we describe the mechanism by which SF3B1 hotspot mutations induce aberrant splicing and the fate of resulting NMD-sensitive aberrant mRNAs in several cancer types. These mutations are associated with the expression of hundreds of aberrantly spliced junctions, mostly by utilizing a cryptic AG. While some aberrant junctions are common across different cancer types, others are tumor specific, which in some cases is a consequence of tissue-specific gene expression; however, additional factors likely contribute to these differences. Interestingly, aberrant splicing was observed only in patients carrying hotspot mutations located in the C-terminal HEAT domains, but not in samples from “non-hotspot” patients, as they clustered with the SF3B1WT patients in aberrant junction usage comparisons. The majority of these non-hotspot mutations are located away from the HEAT repeat domains, which suggests that they may have different effects on cancer cells or simply are passenger mutations, and are not the focus of the present study. We calculated an electrostatic potential map based on a homology model of SF3B1WT with importin-β and observed that all hotspot mutations are co-localized in a limited, positively charged region even though they are distributed across five different HEAT domains (Figure 7A). Furthermore, while there are various amino acid substitutions at the hotspots that result in change of size and/or polarity of side chains, our data suggest the functional consequences on splicing for these changes are similar. We show that hotspot SF3B1MUT induces aberrant 3′ splicing in junctions associated with specific sequence features: an enrichment of As followed by a short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG located −15 to −24 nt from the canonical 3′ ss.

The position of the hotspot mutations located in the five HEAT repeat domains (highlighted in yellow) is represented in the inset. (B and C) Schematic representation of splicing in SF3B1WT (B) and SF3B1MUT (C) cells and molecular consequences of transcripts is also shown. Figure options Based on computational analysis, it was recently suggested that SF3B1 mutations cause a change in the size of the sterically protected region downstream of the BP without any altered BP recognition allowing the utilization of the cryptic AG (DeBoever et al., 2015). It was also suggested that SF3B1 mutations could alter interactions with U2AF2, affecting the ability to recognize the canonical 3′ ss and leading to cryptic 3′ ss selection. In contrast, we provide experimental evidence that the short and weak Py tract upstream of the cryptic AG is insufficient for the recruitment of the U2AF complex and that the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss, and thereby interaction with U2AF2 is required to observe aberrant splicing as well. In addition, we have demonstrated that the SF3B1MUT U2 complex utilizes a BP that is different from the one used by the wild-type U2 complex (proposed model, Figures 7B and 7C). Based on these data and the restricted localization of the hotspot mutations, we hypothesize that SF3B1MUT interacts differently with the pre-mRNA or splicing factors that are important for the recognition of AG during the second step of splicing. The close proximity of the two mapped BPs for ZDHHC16 (−30A for SF3B1WT and −34A for SF3B1MUT) reported here (Figure 4E) and the published data on the crosslinking of SF3B1 to bases flanking the BPS (Gozani et al., 1998) would suggest a competition between the SF3B1WT- and SF3B1MUT-incorporated U2 snRNP complexes to select the canonical or cryptic AG for splicing, respectively. The mechanism by which SF3B1MUT favors selection of a different BP can only be speculated at this point. Based on our data and a previous study investigating spliceostatin A’s mechanism of action (Corrionero et al., 2011), there are at least two hypotheses: the selection of the new BP is guided by SF3B1MUT through enhanced direct interactions with specific nucleotides flanking the new BPS compensating for reduced base pairing with U2 snRNA or by the base pairing of U2 snRNA with the new/suboptimal BPS compensating for impaired interactions of SF3B1MUT across the canonical BPS.  Although SF3B1MUT does not seem to affect the pre-assembly of U2 snRNP (preliminary data not shown), it is possible that the interactions with splicing factors involved in selection of an alternative AG in the second step of splicing are impaired. Previously, it has been reported that the second step splicing factor, Slu7, is required for correct 3′ ss selection (Chua and Reed, 1999a ;  Chua and Reed, 1999b). Similar to U2AF1, Slu7 harbors a Zn knuckle domain, and it is conceivable that it directly interacts with AG during the second step of splicing. As observed in the case of SF3B1MUT, depletion of Slu7 results in selection of a cryptic AG closer to the BPS. This suggests that SF3B1 hotspot mutations may impair the recruitment of Slu7 to the catalytic core. Additionally, it has been reported that splicing factor SPF45 (hSPF45 is RBM17) is involved in recognition and activation of an alternative AG upstream of the canonical 3′ ss. It has been suggested that SPF45 directly or indirectly binds to the upstream alternative AG with the help of SF3B1 and promotes its utilization during the second catalytic step (Corsini et al., 2007 ;  Lallena et al., 2002). Interestingly, as observed in the present study for SF3B1MUT, SPF45 also depends on the integrity of the canonical 3′ ss to splice at the alternative AG. Since SF3B1MUT binds at a different BPS, it can be speculated that the recruited SPF45 can access the cryptic AG which is otherwise prevented due to the steric hindrance by SF3B1WT. Taken together, the SF3B1 hotspot mutations could be facilitating SPF45 activity and/or abrogating Slu7 activity for selection of the aberrant AG, thereby providing an unanticipated mechanism for regulation of splice site utilization.  Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is a known cellular mechanism that adds complexity and flexibility in gene expression to induce stage-specific patterns not only by inducing expression of a particular isoform but also by engaging NMD to downregulate gene expression (Ge and Porse, 2014 ;  Kalyna et al., 2012). Here, we predicted that approximately half of the aberrantly spliced transcripts in SF3B1MUT cells are NMD sensitive, and we have demonstrated that the associated canonical isoforms are downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels. The downregulation of a large number of genes induced by this “spliceosome sickness” could be the cause of impaired cell functions that contribute to cancer phenotypes and potentially create dependency on essential genes or pathways for survival. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency is a proposed mechanism for disease pathogenesis in MDS, where chromosome 5q is deleted and decreased expression of genes located on the remaining chromosome is observed (e.g., RPS14 and CSKN1A1; Ebert et al., 2008 ;  Schneider et al., 2014). It is plausible that SF3B1 mutations contribute to MDS in a similar fashion by downregulating expression of certain genes resulting in a non-classical path to haploinsufficiency. In addition to the downregulation of canonical proteins, it is also possible that NMD-insensitive aberrant transcripts are translated into aberrant proteins that have altered function. Proteomic analysis of isogenic SF3B1MUT cells did not reveal the presence of aberrant proteins (data not shown), but this may be due to limitations of assay sensitivity, and additional targeted SILAC or deep RNA sequencing of active ribosome fractions may have the required sensitivity to detect such proteins. Recently, several groups reported the molecular consequences and phenotypic effects of other spliceosome mutations, such as U2AF1 and the exonic splicing enhancer binding serine/arginine-rich protein SRSF2 ( Ilagan et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015 ;  Shirai et al., 2015). Though there are some overlaps in genes differentially spliced in tissues affected by each spliceosome mutation, we see only minimal overlaps in predicted NMD targets (Figure S7). However, mutations in all three splicing factors are observed in MDS and are mutually exclusive, suggesting that some of the downstream effects might be common. Thus, while not explored in this study, it is likely that SF3B1 mutations result in defects in hematopoiesis, as has been observed in animal models of SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations. Additional work is ongoing to define the downstream splicing abnormalities that drive the phenotypic effects of spliceosome mutations. Finally, it is also plausible that mutations in SF3B1 impact other proposed splicing regulators (e.g., chromatin, histone modifications), and these should be the subject of future study ( de Almeida et al., 2011; Kfir et al., 2015 ;  Khan et al., 2013).  In summary, computational and experimental approaches were used to demonstrate that SF3B1MUT utilizes a different BP to induce aberrant splicing across multiple cancer types. These insights describe a neomorphic activity for SF3B1 mutations that causes downregulation of canonical protein expression. Furthermore, these studies provide a foundation for the potential discovery of targeted approaches for the treatment of patients carrying SF3B1 hotspot mutations.  Mutational hotspots indicate selective pressure across a population of tumor samples, but their prevalence within and across cancer types is incompletely characterized. An approach to detect significantly mutated residues, rather than methods that identify recurrently mutated genes, may uncover new biologically and therapeutically relevant driver mutations. Here we developed a statistical algorithm to identify recurrently mutated residues in tumour samples. We applied the algorithm to 11,119 human tumors, spanning 41 cancer types, and identified 470 hotspot somatic substitutions in 275 genes. We find that half of all human tumors possess one or more mutational hotspots with widespread lineage-, position-, and mutant allele-specific differences, many of which are likely functional. In total, 243 hotspots were novel and appeared to affect a broad spectrum of molecular function, including hotspots at paralogous residues of Ras-related small GTPases RAC1 and RRAS2. Redefining hotspots at mutant amino acid resolution will help elucidate the allele-specific differences in their function and could have important therapeutic implications.  Among the best-studied therapeutic targets in human cancers are proteins encoded by genes with tumor-specific mutational hotspots, such as KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, KIT, and EGFR. The acquisition of somatic mutations is one of the major mechanisms responsible for the dysregulation of proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis that is required for oncogenesis. Comprehensive genomic characterization of tumors has produced significant insights into the somatic aberrations that define individual cancer types1,2, broadening our understanding of the dysfunctional molecular pathways that govern tumor initiation, progression, and maintenance. These data have spurred the development of computational algorithms to identify cancer driver genes, defined as those in which molecular abnormalities lead to a fitness advantage for the affected cancer cells (Methods).  These computational approaches develop either gene-level statistical models that exploit different mutational patterns3–6 to identify significantly mutated genes or use weight-of-evidence-based methods1,7 that are heuristic and ratiometric in approach. Together, these methods focus on identifying cancer genes from a multitude of diverse molecular abnormalities affecting the gene. However, not all genomic alterations in cancer genes are driver alterations. Furthermore, not all driver alterations in a cancer gene have the same functional impact, and are therefore likely to have varying clinical significance. The potentially diverse functional effects of different lesions in the same gene are not captured and reported by gene-level models, but are rather assumed to be equivalent. However, emerging data indicate that different hotspot mutations in the same cancer gene can be functionally distinct in vitro and in vivo and display different clinical phenotypes and drug sensitivity8–11. Moreover, it is unknown how widespread such hotspot-specific functional differences may be.  To date, studies of hotspot mutations in cancer have been limited to within individual tumor types12–14 or have focused on individual cancer genes across tumor types15. A systematic population-scale, cross-cancer, genome-wide analysis of mutational hotspots has not been performed and the extent to which mutant allele and lineage-specific effects exist remains unknown. As broad-based clinical sequencing has begun to inform the care of individual cancer patients, this would begin to address one of the greatest challenges in the practice of genomically driven cancer medicine: interpreting the biological and clinical significance of mutations in even presumed actionable cancer genes as they arise in oncology clinics.  To address this challenge, we develop a computational algorithm to identify driver mutations, rather than driver genes. We assembled and rigorously curated a large repository of cancer genome data consisting of the sequenced tumor exomes and whole genomes of 11,119 human tumors representing 41 tumor types. We developed a biologically aware, statistically principled computational model by combining observed biological phenomena such as nucleotide mutability and varying gene-specific mutation rates into coefficients that we incorporate into binomial statistics. From this, we systematically identify individual recurrent mutations and associate these with related temporal and transcriptional data to investigate lineage-specific variation in mutations, and identify novel hotspots with likely clinical implications.  Go to: Results Landscape of hotspots mutations in primary human cancer  We collected the mutational data from the sequenced exomes and genomes of 11,119 human tumors in 41 tumor types (Supplementary Table 1). These originate from diverse sources including large international consortia and various published studies (Methods). This cohort represents a broad range of primary human malignancies with three or more tumor types in each of nine major organ systems (Fig. 1a). The repository consists of 2,007,694 somatic substitutions in protein-coding regions with a median of 57 mutations (25 and 125 mutations; 25th and 75th percentile respectively) per tumor-normal pair with significant variability in mutation rates among and between tumors and types4,16. In total, 19,223 human genes harbor at least one somatic mutation in this dataset.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Mutational data and hotspot detection Here, we define a mutational hotspot as an amino acid position in a protein-coding gene that is mutated (by substitutions) more frequently than would be expected in the absence of selection (Methods). In this analysis, we focus exclusively on individual substitutions rather than other somatic abnormalities such as translocations, amplifications, deletions, or epigenetic modifications. To identify mutational hotspots, including low-incidence mutations, we developed a binomial statistical model that incorporates several aspects of underlying mutational processes including nucleotide context mutability, gene-specific mutation rates, and major expected patterns of hotspot mutation emergence (Supplementary Fig. 1a and 2, Supplementary Code; Methods). As considerable variability exists in the methods and standards for mutation calling used by individual studies and centers, we also developed several evidence-based criteria for eliminating probable false positive hotspots (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 1b). In total, we identified 470 statistically significant hotspots (q-value < 0.01) affecting 275 protein-coding genes (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Overall, more than half of all hotspots were determined to be novel (Fig. 1b, Table 1, Supplementary Table 2, and Methods) and 54.8% of all tumors assessed here possessed one or more hotspot mutations.  Table 1 Table 1 Select new hotspots in cancer genes Most affected genes possessed only a single hotspot (Supplementary Fig. 3a). A subset of genes, however, possessed many hotspots of varying frequency. In total, 49 genes possessed two or more hotspots (Fig. 1c), with many of these also arising in the greatest number of tumor types (Supplementary Fig. 3b). TP53 R248 was the most disseminated hotspot, observed in 25 tumor types. Among a subset of even well characterized oncogenes, a pattern of both known and novel hotspots emerge (Fig. 1d). Moreover, the number of observed mutant amino acids at a given hotspot generally increases with its mutational frequency across tumors types (Supplementary Fig. 3c), though 35% (n=164) of hotspots mutate to only a single variant amino acid. In most genes, hotspots bear only a fraction of the total mutational burden across the gene, whereas in a subset of cancer genes, the dominant mutational hotspot constitutes the vast majority of mutations independent of total mutational burden (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3d). Overall, we identified considerable variability in the patterns of mRNA expression of individual hotspots in even canonical oncogenes (Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating that levels of expression are often not correlated with the biologic significance of known activating mutations.  The patterns by which some hotspots emerge support new clinical paradigms for testing targeted agents. Some hotspots that dominate the mutational landscape in one or a few cancer types also arise as uncommon subsets of many others. For instance, IDH1 R132 is most common in low-grade gliomas, glioblastomas, acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), and cutaneous melanomas; but it is also present in 1 to 6 tumors in each of 11 additional cancer types. AKT1 E17K arises in greatest numbers in breast cancer, but also in 1 to 3 tumors of 10 additional cancer types. The distribution of CREBBP R1446 mutations is qualitatively different. They were originally identified in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemias17, but in this cohort of mostly primary disease, we find that they arise in only a small minority (1–3; 0.17–1.7%) of many (11) cancer types. Such patterns reaffirm the value of basket study designs that test mutant-specific inhibitors in early phase clinical trials, where enrollment is based on specific mutations in patients instead of tissue of origin.  A lineage map of all hotspots in genes with at least one common hotspot (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5) indicates most hotspots are defined more by the tissue types rather than the organ systems in which they arise. Of all hotspots, 81% arise in two or more tumor types, suggesting that many hotspot mutations may confer a growth advantage across diverse lineages. Indeed, of hotspots present in multiple tumor types, only 7.6% (n = 36) are confined to a single organ system (Table 2). Thus, hotspot mutations that arise in a single tumor type may reflect organ-specific growth advantages but they represent only a small minority of all hotspot mutations in cancer. Likewise, a subset of hotspots arises in a cell-type specific manner. Twenty-seven hotspots (5.7%) were more frequently mutated in tumors of a squamous cell lineage (Supplementary Fig. 6), the most significant of which were MAPK1 E322 and EP300 D1399 (q-value = 6×10−13 and 1×10−11 respectively, χ2) and may potentially confer a squamous cell-type specific growth advantage.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Lineage landscape of hotspot mutations Table 2 Table 2 Organ system-specific hotspots Overall, the presence, type, and frequency of hotspots by tumor type vary widely (Fig. 2b). In some tumor types, a large proportion of tumors possess one or more hotspot mutations including a significant fraction of tumors with a hotspot in a candidate oncogene (Fig. 2b, top). Conversely, other tumor types never or rarely possess a tumor defined by a hotspot identified here. Some of these differences are certainly attributable to the fact that hotspots are only one of many possible driver genomic aberrations, including specific gene fusions or focal amplifications and deletions. These other aberrations may define tumors of a given type, but they are not mutually exclusive with hotspots in many cancers. Other differences could not, alone, be explained by the overall mutational burden in these tumor types. For instance, uterine carcinosarcomas and prostate cancers have a similar mutation rate while there is 3-fold greater frequency of hotspot-bearing tumors among the former. Likewise, while papillary thyroid and high-grade pontine gliomas have mutations rates similar to nasopharyngeal tumors and neuroblastomas, the former far more commonly bear hotspot mutations (Fig. 2b).  Unconventional hotspots  In addition to missense mutations, we identified a variety of unconventional hotspot mutations with varied impact. Among these were 13 splice site hotspots. For each of these hotspots, an associated transcript abnormality was identified from RNA sequencing of affected tumors (exon skipping, intron retention, in-frame deletions; Supplementary Fig. 7a), including two previously characterized in-frame activating mutations (MET D1010_splice and PIK3R1 M582_splice, both exon 14 skipping events). We also identified 70 hotspots in 34 genes for which a nonsense mutation was among a diversity of changes at the affected residue, including 28 hotspots in which only a nonsense mutation was present (Supplementary Fig. 7b). While nonsense mutations scattered throughout a gene may reflect a pattern of loss-of-function consistent with tumor suppressor activity, a nonsense hotspot would appear to indicate the selection for the selective truncation of specific functional domains. Such events are consistent with the loss of some functions and the retention of others, as has been observed previously in genes such as PIK3R1, NOTCH1, and MET18,19. These hotspots aside, there was a depletion of nonsense mutations in hotspots in constitutively essential genes (p-value<10−16, those genes predicted or experimentally verified to be essential across all cell and tissue types and developmental states20). Otherwise, the specific impact of nonsense hotspots is generally unknown and belies the disseminated pattern of truncating mutations in likely or proven tumor suppressors (Supplementary Fig. 7c).  Lineage diversity and mutant allele-specificity  The majority of hotspot mutations arose in diverse tumor types and organ systems, yet widespread differences exist among individual residues and mutant amino acids in hotspots, genes, and tumor types (Fig. 3a). Examining the spectrum of KRAS mutations, which includes the most frequently mutated hotspot overall in our study (KRAS G12; n=736 mutant tumors, Fig. 1d and and2a),2a), clarified patterns only incidentally observed in the past. We found that gastric cancers were more similar to multiple myeloma in the preponderance of non-G12 mutations compared to endometrial, lung, colorectal, and pancreas tumors (p-value = 5.3×10−18, Supplementary Table 4). Only colorectal tumors had KRAS A146 mutations whereas pancreas tumors lacked G13 mutations (p-values = 4×10−7 and 2.8×10−15 respectively). Many of these lineage-specific patterns were present at finer resolution as well. Among KRAS G12 mutations, the abundance of G12C mutations are highest in lung adenocarcinomas (p-value = 4×10−42), an event that may be associated with prognostic differences compared with non-G12C KRAS mutations21–23. Such mutant amino acid specificity was also apparent in pancreas tumors, where KRAS G12R was more common than in any other tumor type (21% versus between 0 and 2.6%; χ2 p-value = 4.8×10−19). Gastric cancers, on the other hand, had the fewest G12V mutations among all KRAS G12-mutant tumor types, but the highest proportion of G12S (p-value = 0.007, Fig. 3b). There is a different balance among hotspots in the other Ras genes. While papillary thyroid cancers nearly exclusively possessed codon Q61 mutations in HRAS and NRAS (p-value = 4×10−7), there was a higher prevalence of G12 and 13 codon mutations in these genes in AMLs, colorectal, bladder, and head and neck cancers, which together share few mutational processes in common (p-value = 4×10−10, Fig. 3a).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Lineage diversity and mutant allele specificity Similar differences emerged in other driver cancer genes with multiple hotspots. V600E mutations describe nearly all BRAF hotspot mutations in melanoma, papillary thyroid, and colorectal carcinomas, whereas multiple myelomas are similar to lung adenocarcinoma in which non-V600E hotspots predominate (p-value = 1.9×-10−32). The balance between extracellular and kinase domain mutations in EGFR between brain tumors and lung adenocarcinoma (p-value = 3.3×10−12) respectively have been documented previously and affect their biological impact and the efficacy of genotype-directed therapy10. ERBB2 followed a similar pattern, where extracellular domain mutations typified by S310F are far more common than are kinase domain mutations in bladder cancers compared to breast cancers (p-value = 0.006, Fig. 3a). Another notable gene was PIK3CA. While bladder and cervical cancers are similar in their distribution of PIK3CA hotspot mutations, they vary significantly from breast cancers in the overall balance of helical to kinase domain mutations, possessing far fewer H1047R mutations among PIK3CA-mutated cases (p-value = 4.8×10−19). Endometrial and colorectal cancers also have a similar pattern of PIK3CA hotspots, but both have a higher prevalence of R88Q mutations than any other tumor type (p-value = 1.3×10−11, Fig. 3a). Such patterns extend beyond essential MAPK or PI3K signaling components, such as with SF3B1 K700 mutations that predominate in breast cancers and chronic lymphocytic leukemias whereas melanomas more frequently possess R625 mutations (p-value = 0.0001). Finally, mutant amino acid specificity was not limited to hotspots in Ras genes. The IDH1 R132H hotspot mutation predominated in multiple brain tumor types, but cysteine was the most common IDH1 R132 mutant amino acid in melanoma, which is unlikely to be exclusively related to UV light exposure, as this is also true in AMLs that lack a UV-driven etiology (p-value = 3.9×10−21). Together, these results indicate that substantial mutant amino acid specificity exists among hotspot mutations across highly diverse tumor lineages. Two related conclusions may be drawn from these data. First, different hotspots in the same gene may possess in many cases different function, much of which may be lineage-dependent, while not excluding the possibility that some may still arise as a function of differing underlying mutational mechanisms. Second, that perhaps different mutant amino acids within the same hotspot can be functionally different, support for which is growing8,11.  Timing of individual hotspots  We next sought to determine if hotspot mutations, many of which are likely driver mutations and in some cases may serve as the initiating lesion, typically arise earlier than do non-recurrent mutations in the same genes and are therefore more often clonal. Overall, mutations at hotspot residues more often resided in a greater fraction of tumor cells (see Methods) and were therefore earlier arising (presumptive clonal), than were non-hotspot mutations in the same genes (Fig. 3c). So, while prior work has shown that driver genes in lung adenocarcinomas were enriched for clonal mutations24, we found that this was true of hotspot mutations across a broad class of cancer genes and tumor types. However, there was considerable variability among hotspots. While colorectal and endometrial cancers have a similar pattern of PIK3CA hotspot mutations (Fig. 3a) and share hypermutated subtypes of tumors driven by MSI and POLE exonuclease domain mutations25,26, colorectal tumors were unique in the clonality of the E545 and H1047 mutations. The majority of PIK3CA E545 helical domain mutations in colorectal cancers were subclonal, whereas H1047 kinase domain mutations were clonal, a difference that was not apparent in endometrial tumors, in which both are early clonal mutations (Fig. 3d). This may be a function of the pattern of oncogenic co-mutation in these tumors as PIK3CA E545, but not H1047, mutations were significantly associated with KRAS mutations in these colorectal cancers (χ2 p-value = 0.0004) and in previous cohorts27. Overall, these differences in the molecular timing of specific hotspots augurs potentially important differences in their function in tumor initiation versus progression that requires further study.  Population-level hotspots in the long tail  Consistent with the so-called long tail of the frequency distribution of somatically mutated genes across cancer2, we found that 85% of all hotspots identified here were mutated in less than 5% of tumors of all cancer types in which they were found (Fig. 4a). Such findings have led to calls for sequencing up to many thousands of additional specimens from every tumor type28. However, many hotspots present at low frequency across cancers are not mutated commonly or significantly in even a single cancer type. Indeed, 23% of all hotspots identified here were present in only one or two samples in the tumor types in which it was observed. This included 19 hotspots arising in only one sample of each affected cancer type such as U2AF1 I24, MYC T58, the hyperactivating MTOR I250029, PIK3CB D1067, EP300 H1451, and ERBB3 M60. Therefore, many driver mutations (rather than genes) may never be found mutated at even the minimal frequencies (2–3%) proposed by previous studies as a goal in each cancer type. Conversely, population-level analysis, rather than by individual cancer type or organ system, allows identification of hotspots that arise as even private mutations in rare malignancies, for which additional broad-scale sequencing is most challenging. While rare, such recurrent alleles are evidence of selection and may be associated with specific phenotypes, such as exceptional responses30,31, de novo resistance to cancer therapy, or reveal specific facets of pathway biology. Consequently, we found that notable long-tail hotspots affect a broad spectrum of abnormal molecular function including macromolecular transport and transcriptional regulation (Table 1, Supplementary Note, and Supplementary Fig. 8), as well as essential components of key signaling pathways.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Candidate Ras-related small GTPase driver mutations in the long tail Long-tail hotspots in Ras superfamily members  Mutations in the Ras family of small GTPases occur widely in human cancers. As expected, these were among the most significant hotspots detected here (Supplementary Table 2), affecting 1,335 tumors (12% of all cases). Whereas G12, G13, and Q61 codon hotspots predominate in KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS, albeit at varying frequencies in different tumor types (Fig. 2a and and3a),3a), we also identified GQ60GK, K117, and A146 hotspots in KRAS. Both K117 and A146 are known activating hotspots in the long tail, but we also identified a previously occult GQ60GK dinucleotide substitution (q-value = 2.3×10−6) in 11 tumors. This dinucleotide substitution results in a Q61K mutation accompanied by a G60 synonymous mutation that are present in cis (in concomitant RNA sequencing, Supplementary Fig. 9). Although Q>K mutations at codon 61 can result from 3’G>T single-nucleotide mutations in KRAS, 100% of these tumors harbored the dinucleotide substitution, a rare spontaneous event in human genomes. Overall, the distribution of codon 61 mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS are very different, with Q>K mutations occurring significantly less frequently in KRAS (p-value=0.016; Fig. 4b). GA>TT mutations were the most common dinucleotide substitution producing GQ60GK (Fig. 4c) and converts the ACC codon at KRAS G60 to TCC, which is the sequence of the G60 codon in NRAS, in which Q61K mutations are far more common and arise nearly exclusively from single-nucleotide mutations. It remains to be determined whether KRAS GQ60GK is therefore driven by a pattern of codon usage at the −1 position. Notably, only one tumor had evidence of a non-KRAS GQ60GK mutation, an NRAS-mutant cutaneous melanoma (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 5).  We next explored whether KRAS GQ60GK may serve as a driver of Ras pathway activity as do conventional KRAS hotspots. GQ60GK is indeed present in diverse tumor types that all have well-established Ras-driven subsets (Supplementary Table 5). Reasoning that if GQ60GK were a passenger mutation in Ras-driven tumors, alternative MAPK activating mutations may be present in these tumors. Instead, we found that in every GQ60GK-mutant sample where another putative driver of MAPK signaling was present, that lesion was either 1) subclonal, defining a different clone than did GQ60GK; 2) low activity; or 3) a passenger mutation (Supplementary Table 5). Also, despite the frequency of GA>TT, there was no evidence that a common underlying mutational process or exogenous mutagen was the source of GQ60GK. There was no evidence of UV light exposure in the clinical histories or nucleotide contexts of most affected cases, only one of which was a cutaneous melanoma. Moreover, GQ60GK arose in both hypermutated (MSI-H colon lacking BRAF V600E) and non-hypermutated tumors. Finally, rare G60 missense mutations were evident in K- and HRAS in this dataset and in the literature (Supplementary Table 5)32. So, while we cannot exclude the possibility that the GQ60GK dinucleotide substitution is simply an alternative mechanism to achieve Q61K, the accompanying KRAS-specific G60 synonymous mutation may potentiate a different class of Q61-mutant tumors or cause signaling differences among Q61K-mutant tumors between K-N- or HRAS. Although further studies will need to explore the molecular properties of KRAS GQ60GK, this allele represents the most common dinucleotide substitution spanning two codons in human cancer and a mutation more common than other known hotspots in KRAS.  Novel long-tail hotspots were also identified in two other genes that encode members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. RAC1, in which we identified two hotspots, is a Rho subfamily member that plays a vital role in various cellular functions. RAC1 P29S is an oncogenic hotspot in melanomas12,33 that we also identified in head and neck and endometrial cancers (Fig. 4d). This mutation can confer resistance to RAF inhibitor treatment in vitro34, and may underlie early resistance in patients35. We also identified a novel RAC1 A159V hotspot present in 10 tumors (q-value = 2.27×10−6; Fig. 4d). Notably, RAC1 A159V is paralogous to KRAS A146, a known activating mutation36. Whereas activating KRAS A146T mutations arise predominantly in colorectal carcinomas (Supplementary Table 2), RAC1 A159V mutations are most common in head and neck cancers and were not present in any melanomas, despite the frequency of RAC1 P29S in this cancer type. Moreover, similar to P29S mutations, we observed RAC1 A159V mutations in tumors that are both Ras/Raf wildtype and mutant (Fig. 4e). To determine whether RAC1 A159V is an activating mutation, we assessed its effect in vitro. Active RAC1 is GTP-bound, interacting with PAK1 to activate downstream effectors. Therefore, to quantify RAC1 activation in vitro, we utilized a PAK1 pull-down assay. In HEK293T cells expressing RAC1 A159V, there was significant RAC1 activation to levels equal to or exceeding positive control RAC1 GTPγS cells and greater than even those levels induced by the known RAC1 P29S oncogenic mutation (Fig. 4f). Moreover, cells expressing RAC1 Q61R, a mutation we identified in a primary prostate cancer that is paralogous to KRAS Q61, also potently induced RAC1 activation (Fig. 4d,f).  RRAS2 is a Ras-related small GTPase37. RRAS2 is overexpressed or mutated in a small number of cancer cell lines of various origins38–40, and is oncogenic in vitro with transforming ability similar to established Ras oncoproteins41. However, it has not been documented as somatically mutated in human tumor specimens. Here, we identified a RRAS2 Q72 hotspot present in nine tumors (q-value = 8×10−15). Similar to RAC1 A159V, the RRAS2 Q72 hotspot is paralogous to KRAS Q61 (Fig. 4d). However, unlike RAC1, RRAS2 Q72 does not predominate in any individual tumor type. Also unlike RAC1, the RRAS2 Q72 mutation was present in Ras/Raf wildtype tumors among the affected types (Fig. 4e). This result suggests that RRAS2 activation may be an alternative avenue for tumors to acquire Ras-like activation as previous studies have shown that RRAS2 shares many Ras downstream signaling elements including phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)42,43, the Ral GDP dissociation pathway42, and Raf kinases44. Beyond these hotspots, several less common RAC1 and RRAS2 mutations affect paralogous residues of highly recurrent alleles in KRAS (Fig. 4d), some of which we validated were also activating in vitro (Fig. 4f), indicating that the landscape of potentially functional mutations in these genes extends beyond even these less common long-tail hotspots to private mutations as well.  Go to: Discussion Although we focus only on recurrent substitutions, we did find that while a subset of hotspots were prevalent in individual cancer types, most hotspots are present infrequently across many cancer types. This indicates that studies of any individual cancer type may have limited power to identify novel alleles. We have also begun to detail best practices for the use of diverse public cancer sequencing data in the translational setting. Our approach for hotspot detection incorporates features such as the variable background mutational burden of individual codons and genes, thereby avoiding passenger mutations whose recurrence is due only to their presence in highly mutable amino acids. While the identification of private driver mutations remains challenging, our approach did uncover low-incidence hotspots in highly mutated genes. Though less common, these hotspots are under selection and may confer important clinical phenotypes in cancer patients, such as exceptional responses to cancer therapy30,31.  New mutant alleles in established genes are likely to emerge faster than new cancer genes are identified, extending the long tail of the frequency distribution of somatic mutations. This is especially true as clinical sequencing focuses on profiling advanced and metastatic disease for clinical trial enrollment. Such pre-treated, late-stage cases have been historically under-represented among such population-scale resources, including the one studied here. Moreover, at present there are fewer actionable mutations in cancer than there are cancer genes. Yet the near-term clinical utility of expanding the former is far greater. Our results suggest this will require an understanding of the function of different hotspot mutants in the same gene by lineage, as their function and response to therapy may be mutant amino acid specific. While positive selective pressure may produce the same hotspot mutation, or different variant amino acid changes within the same hotspot residue, it does not imply that they will confer similar selective advantages across lineages. Underlying functional distinctions may explain the differences observed here in the emergence and frequencies of hotspots across lineages. While this remains speculative or unknown for most hotspots, early evidence suggest that this will be true for even some of the most important alleles in human cancer8,9,11. Understanding this landscape of distinct molecular function is the necessary translational prerequisite for effective clinical implementation. This focus on mutations rather than genes will spur studies of the biochemical, biological, signaling impact, and drug sensitivity of candidate individual alleles. Collectively, the complementary study of both significantly mutated individual alleles as well as genes will prove indispensable in enabling precision oncology through clinical decision support for patients sequenced at the point of care.  Go to: Methods Mutational dataset and pre-processing  Mutational data were obtained from three publically available sources: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA); 2) the data portal of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC); 3) various published studies in peer-reviewed journals in which mutational data was made available45,46. Mutation calling algorithms and mutation reporting practices varied from study to study in these curated data, so mutation data review and correction were undertaken where possible. Genomic coordinates of variants from alignments to human reference assembly NCBI36 (hg18) were converted to GRCh37 using LiftOver47 with an Ensembl chain file (see URLs). After standardization to GRCh37, the mutation calls were annotated to gene transcripts in Ensembl release 75 (Gencode release 19), and a single canonical effect per mutation was reported using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) version 7748 and vcf2maf version 1.5. All possible pairs of any two samples with at least 10 somatic mutations were interrogated for sample duplication. For any pair of tumors that shared greater than 80% mutational identity and identical or near-identical clinic-pathological characteristics (upon review of data from the source site/publication), a single tumor in the pair was chosen at random and removed from further analysis as a presumptive duplicate specimen. Furthermore, we excluded small insertions and deletions (indels), despite their presence as true oncogenic hotspots in some genes, due to their greater variability in call quality across datasets. In total, the final dataset included 1,348,424 missense; 524,827 synonymous; 100,866 nonsense; 30,346 splice-site; and 3231 mutations affecting translational start or stop codons. There are also 21,130 oligo-nucleotide variants the majority of which are di-nucleotide mutations along with 71 tri-nucleotide mutations and 13 substitutions of 4bp or longer. Individual mutations and hotspots of interest (detected as described below) were inspected in individual BAM files from tumor and matched normal specimens of DNA and available RNA sequencing data downloaded from CGHub. When available, expression analyses were based on level-3 RNASeqV2 RSEM normalized gene expression counts from RNA sequencing available via the TCGA Data Coordinating Center. These values were log-transformed and scaled across all samples within each cancer type to facilitate comparisons between cancer types.  Definition of a mutational hotspot  For the purposes of this analysis, we first define a driver cancer gene as one in which a molecular abnormality leads to a fitness advantage for the affected cancer cell. This is the broadest definition that encompasses both initiating lesions on which tumor growth depends as well as lesions arising later in tumor progression that perhaps confer a more modest fitness advantage. We then define a hotspot as an amino acid position in protein-coding gene mutated more frequently than would be expected in the absence of selection. Therefore, all of the following mutation types result in the same hotspot: 1) mutations in different nucleotide positions in the same codon of a gene, 2) different nucleotide substitutions at the same site in the same codon that result in different amino acid changes, and 3) mutations where the amino acid substitution is identical but the nucleotide change are different. At present, this analysis is limited to recurrent somatic substitutions, but can be expanded to other classes of somatic alterations such as small insertions and deletions, DNA copy number alterations, and structural rearrangements.  Determining significant mutational hotspots  To determine the statistical significance of individual mutational hotspots, we developed a truncated binomial probability model by incorporating not only underlying features of mutation rates in cancer but also anticipating the gene-specific pattern with which hotspots may arise in different classes of possible cancer genes. In its most general form, if X represents the count of mutations in n samples, the probability of observing k mutations is:  Pr(X=k)=(nk)pk(1−p)n−k (1) where p is the probability of a mutation in any sample. However, differences exist in the mutability of specific nucleotide contexts in cancer genomes. These vary as a function of the underlying mutational process, potential molecular abnormality in normal DNA maintenance pathways, and possible exposure to exogenous mutagens16. Moreover, individual genes have highly variably nucleotide composition and background mutation rates. To address these fundamental characteristics, we integrated a coefficient into a position-specific probability that incorporates both the mutability of the trinucleotide context in which the mutation arose and the trinucleotide composition of the affected gene. For each of the 32 possible trinucleotides, we estimate the mutability of a given trinucleotide t as:  mt=CtFt (2) where Ct is the number of mutations affecting the central position of trinucleotide t across all samples and Ft is the number of occurrences of the trinucleotide t in the coding genome. Too little data existed to compute tumor type- or underlying mutational process-specific mutability. Because a mutated codon in a given gene is comprised of mutations in any one of three trinucleotides that encode that codon, we estimate the mutability of a codon c in gene g as:  mc,g=∑t∈cmtnt,cnc (3) where nt,c is the number of mutations in the central position of trinucleotide t in codon c and nc is the number of mutations in codon c overall. We estimate the mutability of gene g as μg = Cg/(nLg), where Cg is the number of mutations affecting the gene across the n samples and Lg is the length of the gene in amino acids. We then estimated the expected mutability of a given gene g as:  mg=∑tNt,gmtLG (4) where Nt,g is the number of occurrences of trinucleotide t in gene g. The relative mutability of a codon within a gene is then rc,g = mc,g/mg. This leads to a binomial parameter for hotspot detection of:  pc,g=rc,gμg (5) We sought to avoid overestimating the background mutation rate for a gene with several hotspots. This would limit the detection of lower frequency hotspots (warmspots) due to the rate of recurrence of one or a few dominant hotspots in the same gene. We therefore developed a truncated form by removing positions in gene g bearing greater than or equal to the 99th percentile of all mutations in the gene. The new background rate is therefore μ′g, calculated as before where the prime signifies the mutation counts and lengths modified using the above threshold. Then p′c,g=rc,gμ′g. Finally, in rarely mutated genes where the probability p is exceedingly small (relative to the size of the cohort N and the length of the protein L), we limited the number of false positive hotspots by allowing p′c,g to get no smaller than the 20th percentile of all p′ dataset-wide. Therefore, the final binomial probability is:  p′′c,g=max{p′c,g20%ile of allp' (6) Accordingly, we calculate one-sided p-values for all unique amino acids in every annotated gene per the binomial form given in eq. (1) with probability from eq. (6) and test whether more mutations are observed than would be expected by chance given the pattern of all mutations in the gene; its composition and length; the pattern of its mutability; and the number and type of samples assessed.  Multiple hypothesis correction  To correct for multiple hypotheses, we employed a method for false discovery rate correction that assumes dependence among tests. This correction was performed on the gene level in the following manner. P-values were aggregated per gene on the basis of their codon position. For codons that were not mutated in a given gene and therefore not formally assessed, we padded this with a vector of p-values equal to 1 such that the final set of p-values equaled the amino acid length of the given gene. For all resulting p-values in each gene, they were corrected with the Benjamini and Yekutieli49 method (implemented in p.adjust in the stats package in R) and significant hotspots were those sites with q-values < 0.01.  Mutation call quality filtering  Considerable variability exists in the processing and generation of mutational data in individual cohorts by originating centers. To address this variability, we developed several weight-of-evidence based criteria for eliminating presumptive false positives and sequencing artifacts from individual mutation calls as well as from hotspots across the dataset (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Initially, to exclude likely germline variants misattributed as somatic mutations we exclude any mutation identified by both 1000genomes and the NHLBI or those identified only by 1000genomes in two or more samples. We then reasoned that hotspots arising in genes not expressed in a given tumor type are less likely to exert biological impact. We therefore removed from consideration hotspot mutations in genes whose expression was <0.1 transcripts per million (TPM) in 90% or more of the tumors of that type, or for tumors that lacked RNA sequencing data, if more than 95% of all tumors independent of organ of origin had expression of TPM < 0.1. After determining statistically significant hotspots (described above), hotspots were removed from consideration based on a decision tree model as follows. First, a presumptive true positive (pTPs) list of hotspots was predetermined as coding positions harboring substitutions in five or more tumor samples (from the August 2013 release of the cBioPortal45,46) in one of 341 key cancer-associated genes sequenced as part of routine CLIA-certified sequencing of matched tumor and normal specimens at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center50. Initially, for all samples in which a hotspot was observed and for which the fraction of tumor cells mutated could be calculated from corresponding variant allele frequency and DNA copy number data, we calculated the fraction of tumors in which that site was mutated subclonally (in fewer than 90% of tumor cells). If the fraction of samples in which the hotspot arose subclonally exceeded the maximum such value among pTPs, it was excluded. For remaining sites, we excluded potential hotspots that arose from mutation calling bias from a single source center. We identified cohorts in which subsets of samples were called by different centers and excluded hotspots in which greater than 85% of contributing mutation calls originated from a single mutation-calling center. Next, as local sequence complexity can affect alignment accuracy in various ways based on the read lengths and chemistry of source studies in our dataset, we sought to exclude hotspots on the basis of sequence context. We excluded hotspots where the minimum of Shannon entropy calculated from both 12bp or 24bp of flanking sequence on either the 5’ or 3’ side of the mutated site was less than the minimum such value among pTPs. We then excluded hotspots that were positioned at either the 5’ or 3’ end of a mono-, di-, or tri-nucleotide homopolymer runs of 10bp or longer. Remaining hotspots were then excluded if either the sum of their ranked weighted 100 and 24bp alignability (determined by CRG Alignability; UCSC Genome Browser) was less than the minimum value of pTPs or their weighted 24bp alignability was lower than the 12.5 percentile of all sites. We also excluded any hotspot that while passing these criteria affected a gene that was 1) already rich in presumptive false positives by these criteria [the number of retained hotspots was less than two times the count of hotspots in the gene excluded by one or more of these criteria] or 2) one of 20 well-characterized presumptive “red-herring” cancer genes due to high mutation rates that co-vary with underlying features independent of selection4. Finally, we manually inspected the sequencing data contributing to the mutation call for select hotspots in a sampling of affected tumor and matched normal samples. The significant hotspots (q-value < 0.01) that were excluded from consideration on the basis of this model are available in Supplementary Table 3.  Hotspot mutation data and literature review  In addition to the mutation call filtering described above, we independently validated the accuracy of a subset of mutation calls contributing to the novel hotspots discussed in the text. We downloaded BAM files of the aligned and unaligned sequencing reads corresponding to the tumor and matched normal exomes from each patient harboring one of the novel hotspots we discuss in detail in the manuscript (RAC1 A159; RRAS2 Q72; NUP93 E14 and Q15; MAX R60; and MAX H28) and reprocessed these from raw FASTQ to mutation calls with an independent sequence analysis pipeline30,31. We re-identified the hotspot mutation of interest in 34 of 35 affected specimens. Only a single sample failed to reproduce the published mutation (NUP93 E14 in a hepatocellular carcinoma), but NUP93 E14K remains statistically significant even after excluding the tumor in which the mutation was not called by the independent pipeline. To determine novel hotspots among the 470 identified here, we classified each mutation into one of three levels of evidence from an extensive literature review (Supplementary Table 2). Level-1 mutations are those not previously identified in human tumors or have been identified in an individual sample, but never described as a hotspot of recurrent mutation. This also includes mutations previously documented in the germline of patients, but never identified previously as recurrently somatically mutated. Level-2 hotspots are those mutations that have been reported previously in one tumor type that we also identified in the same, but also find mutated in one or more additional tumor types not previously described. Level-3 hotspots are those mutations that have been previously identified in one or more tumor types and have been assessed functionally in vitro or in vivo. Using this categorization, we identified 243, 46, and 181 levels-1, -2, and -3 mutations from the 470 hotspots described here. These were classified as being present or not in established candidate cancer genes (n=880, Fig. 1b) compiled from the Sanger Cancer Gene Census and four additional published sources1,4,5,50.  Cell type specificity analysis  We determined the enrichment of individual hotspots in different cell types (squamous versus non-squamous). For this analysis, squamous cell cancers included head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Hotspots mutated in at least one squamous tumor were examined and their statistical significance was assed with Fisher’s exact test assuming the null hypothesis that squamous and non-squamous tumor samples are equally likely to possess a given hotspot. Resulting p-values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing with Benjamini and Yekutieli49 method and squamous cell-type specific hotspots were those with q-values < 0.01.  Analysis of the fraction of cancer cells mutated  Level-3 segmentation of DNA copy number data was acquired when available without restriction for 15 cohorts (primarily TCGA). Utilizing this data, we estimated tumor purity using absCN-seq51, due to the ease of its automation. We calculated the fraction of tumor cells bearing each mutation (tumor/cancer cell fraction) in each tumor based on this purity estimate, local copy number, and mutant and reference allele sequencing coverage all as previously described52.  Functional validation  DNA coding sequences for wildtype RAC1 as well as RAC1P29S, RAC1Q61R, and RAC1A159V were generated via site-directed mutagenesis (Genewiz, NJ) to include an N-terminal 3xFLAG epitope tag and were subcloned into a pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Life Technologies, NY). The expression constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), and cells were harvested after 72 hours. GTP-bound Rac1 (active Rac1) was isolated via immunoprecipitation using recombinant p21-binding domain (PBD) of PAK1 (PAK1-PBD; Active Rac1 Detection Kit, Cat#8815, Cell Signaling, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Rac1 was detected using kit provided Rac1 primary antibody.  The splicing factor SF3B1 is the most commonly mutated gene in the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), particularly in patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS). We investigated the functional effects of SF3B1 disruption in myeloid cell lines: SF3B1 knockdown resulted in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and impaired erythroid differentiation and deregulation of many genes and pathways, including cell cycle regulation and RNA processing. MDS is a disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell and we thus studied the transcriptome of CD34+ cells from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations using RNA sequencing. Genes significantly differentially expressed at the transcript and/or exon level in SF3B1 mutant compared with wild-type cases include genes that are involved in MDS pathogenesis (ASXL1 and CBL), iron homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism (ALAS2, ABCB7 and SLC25A37) and RNA splicing/processing (PRPF8 and HNRNPD). Many genes regulated by a DNA damage-induced BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 protein complex showed differential expression/splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases. This is the first study to determine the target genes of SF3B1 mutation in MDS CD34+ cells. Our data indicate that SF3B1 has a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known RARS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link.  Go to: Introduction The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) malignancies characterized by blood cell dysplasia and peripheral blood cytopenia. Approximately 30–40% of MDS patients will develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML).1  The recent discovery of somatic splicesomal mutations in MDS has revealed a new leukemogenic pathway involving spliceosomal dysfunction.2, 3 Somatic mutations in the splicing factor genes SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2 and ZRSR2 are frequent in MDS patients.4 Importantly, these genes encode proteins that are all involved in 3′-splice site recognition during pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing. Splicing factor gene mutations occur in over 50% of MDS patients, are highly specific to this disorder, and occur in a mutually exclusive manner.5, 6, 7  SF3B1, encoding a core component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, involved in the recognition of the branchpoint sequence, is the most commonly mutated gene found in MDS (20–28% of all patients).2, 8, 9 We and others have shown that mutations of the splicing factor SF3B1 are found in a high percentage (>70%) of MDS patients whose disease is characterised by the presence of ring sideroblasts, including both refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS).2, 8 The close association between SF3B1 mutation and the presence of ring sideroblasts is consistent with a causal relationship and makes this the first gene to be strongly associated with a specific morphological feature of MDS. Ring sideroblasts are characterised by an excess accumulation of iron in the mitochondria of erythroblasts,10 and SF3B1 mutant RARS cases show altered iron distribution characterised by coarse iron deposits compared with wild-type RARS cases.11 SF3B1 mutations are generally more prevalent in low-risk MDS and have been shown to be independent predictors of favorable clinical outcome in MDS in most studies.8, 11 The clinical consequences of SF3B1 mutation in MDS are clear, but the functional consequences of these mutations in human cells remain poorly understood. Altered RNA splicing has been suggested as the mechanism underlying the observed phenotypic changes concomitant to splicing factor gene mutations, including SF3B1; 3, 12, 13 however, the target genes in the HSC of MDS cases with SF3B1 mutations are yet to be defined.  SF3B1 mutations in MDS are primarily heterozygous point mutations. The presence of hotspots and the absence of nonsense or frameshift mutations in SF3B1 in MDS patients suggest that SF3B1 mutations are likely to be gain/change-of-function (neomorphic) mutations. A heterozygous Sf3b1+/− knockout mouse model has been shown to develop ring sideroblasts, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of SF3B1 may lead to their formation.11 Recent similar studies have not made this observation, however.14, 15 Thus, it is yet to be determined whether SF3B1 mutations found in MDS are loss-of-function mutations or gain/change-of-function mutations. In this study, we thus evaluated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell growth, gene expression and splicing in a range of myeloid cell lines and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the CD34+ cells of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  Go to: Materials and methods Myeloid cell lines culture  K562, HEL, TF1 and SKM1 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. TF1 and SKM1 cultures were supplemented with 2 and 1 ng/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, respectively.  SF3B1 knockdown  Three non-overlapping small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting SF3B1 and two different scramble sequences with guanine–cytosine content similar to the siRNA sequences (Stealth Select RNAi, Invitrogen) were used to knock down SF3B1 in myeloid cell lines. For each transfection, 30 pmol of siRNA and 2 × 106 cells were electroporated in an Amaxa Nucleofector I, using the Amaxa cell optimization kit V (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Evaluation of green fluorescent protein-positive cells obtained using the pmaxGFP fluorescent expression plasmid confirmed >80% of successfully transfected cells after 24 h. Readout data are reported as mean±s.e.m. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.  Cell growth assay  Live and dead cells were assessed by trypan blue viability testing and counted using a hemocytometer.  Cell cycle analysis  Cells were fixed with ice cold methanol, incubated with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNaseA, as previously described.16 Data were acquired on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience; Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed using FLOWJO software 7.6.4 (FlowJo, Ashland, OR, USA).  Erythroid differentiation  To induce erythroid differentiation, K562, TF1 and HEL cells were cultured with hemin 50 μm for 72 h. Erythroid differentiation was studied by analyzing the expression level of γ-globin (HBG1) using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) as described previously.17 Expression of the erythroid markers CD36, CD71 and CD235a was evaluated by flow cytometry as described previously.16  Quantitative real-time PCR  Total RNA was reverse transcribed using Retroscript kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). The expression levels of SF3B1, ABCB7, FTMT, HBG1, KLF1 and B2M were determined using Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). B2M expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input complementary DNA (cDNA). Triplicate samples were run on a LightCycler 480 Real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK) and expression ratios were calculated using the ddCT method.18  Gene expression profiling  Total RNA (100 ng for each sample) was amplified and labeled with the 3′ IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips, as described previously.19, 20 CEL files were pre-processed using Robust Multi-chip Average and data analysis was performed using GeneSpring 7.3.1 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) 7.5 (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), as previously described.19 Analysis of gene set up- or downregulation was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis,21 as previously described (false discovery rate<0.1).2  Splicing analysis using human genome exon-junction microarray  Total RNA was DNAse treated (Invitrogen), purified (Agencourt RNA Clean XP) and amplified (100 ng) using Ambion WT Expression Kit (Affymetrix). The cDNA was subsequently fragmented and labeled using WT terminal labeling kit (Affymetrix). Samples were hybridized onto Affymetrix Human genome exon-junction arrays, which on average contain 119 unique probes per gene spanning every exon and known exon–exon junction. CEL files were analyzed using GenoSplice technology (www.genosplice.com).22, 23 Data were normalized using quantile normalization. Analysis at the exon level was performed taking into account only exon probes. Analysis at the splicing variant level was performed by taking into account exon–exon junction probes using the FAST DB splicing patterns annotation (release fastdb_2012_2). Unpaired Student's t-test was used to determine exon and splicing pattern variation between cells with SF3B1 knockdown and scramble controls. Genes were considered significantly deregulated when fold change was ⩾1.5 and P-value <0.05. Gene Ontology, KEGG and REACTOME analyses of differentially regulated genes were performed using DAVID.24  Splicing analysis using qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing  Splicing analysis of TP53 was performed using Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted individual bands from PCR-amplified cDNA. Primers and PCR conditions are listed in Supplementary Table S1.  Splicing analysis of cyclins CCNA2 and STK6 was performed using a qRT-PCR on cDNA, using primers specific for splice junctions corresponding to exon inclusion or skipping.25 Primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. TBP expression levels were used to normalize for differences in input cDNA.  RNA sequencing  Bone marrow samples were obtained from MDS patients and healthy controls and CD34+ cells isolated using MACS magnetic cell separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany), as described previously.19, 20 RNA extracted from bone marrow CD34+ cells obtained from 12 MDS patients and 5 healthy controls was used for deep RNA-Seq. Eight of the 12 MDS cases (four RARS and four RCMD-RS) had SF3B1 gene mutation, whereas four cases (all RCMD) had no known mutations in splicing factor genes (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 or ZRSR2) (Supplementary Table S3), as determined by targeted next-generation sequencing data from a previous study.7  Total RNA was DNase treated (Invitrogen), purified using XP beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and processed (100 ng) using NEBNext Ultra directional mRNA Library prep (NEB, Hitchin, UK) as per the manufacturer's protocol for Illumina with two alterations: custom indexes were designed in house and an additional purification step was performed using XP beads (Beckman Coulter) rather than size selection. Samples were run on HiSeq2000 Illumina sequencing machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome using TopHat,26 which can handle reads spanning exon–exon boundaries. Data analysis was performed using edgeR27 to evaluate the whole transcript expression (false discovery rate<0.05) and with DEXSeq28 to evaluate differential exon usage (false discovery rate<0.05). At the expression level, only genes with at least 10 reads in four or more samples were included in the analysis; at the exon level, exons with fewer than 10 reads were excluded. Gender was included as an additional factor in the DEXSeq model testing for differential exon usage. Selected differentially expressed exons were validated using qRT-PCR (Supplemetary Figure S1, Supplementary Information). Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) v2.3 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) was used for visualization of the sequence reads. Pathway analysis was performed using IPA and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, as described above. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE63569.  Go to: Results SF3B1 knockdown inhibits cell growth, induces cell cycle arrest and impairs erythroid differentiation  SF3B1 was knocked down using siRNA technology in four myeloid cell lines (TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1) that we found to be wild type for SF3B1 (Supplementary Information), resulting in a significant decrease in expression ranging between 50 and 60% (Figure 1a).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting SF3B1 was compared with the corresponding cell line transfected with the scramble control. (a) SF3B1 mRNA expression measured 3 days after knockdown. (b ... Cell growth was inhibited in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown in comparison with the scramble control (Figure 1b). Cell cycle arrest in different phases was detected in different myeloid cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1c). K562 cells showed a significant G2M cell cycle arrest with a concomitant reduction in the percentage of cells in the G1 and S phase. TF1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase. HEL cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase and a significant increase in the sub-G1 cell population, indicating increased apoptosis. Similarly, SKM1 cells showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in S and G2M phase with a concomitant increase in the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 and G1 phase, indicating cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and an increase in apoptosis (Figure 1c).  Three cell lines (TF1, K562 and HEL) with SF3B1 knockdown were cultured with hemin to induce erythroid differentiation. We assessed the expression of the erythroid differentiation markers HBG1 and KLF1 using qRT-PCR. A significant reduction in the expression of HBG1 and KLF1 was observed in TF1 and K562 cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown (Figure 1d). In addition, we observed a reduction in the percentage of CD36+CD71+ and CD71+CD235a+ erythroid populations (significant for the CD36+CD71+ population) in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown compared with the scramble control (Figure 1e), suggesting that normal SF3B1 function is required for erythroid differentiation.17  RARS is characterized by FTMT accumulation and low expression levels of the iron transporter ABCB7.17, 29 We have previously shown that SF3B1 knockdown leads to decreased ABCB7 expression and increased FTMT expression in K562 cells.17 In this study, we have extended these observations to the other three myeloid cell lines investigated (Figure 2a). In addition, restoration of SF3B1 expression to normal levels after 10 days of culture was followed by restoration of ABCB7 expression levels to normal (Supplementary Figure S2).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Effects of SF3B1 knockdown on gene expression and splicing. (a) ABCB7 and FTMT expression levels in TF1, K562, HEL and SKM1 cells with SF3B1 knockdown, as measured by qRT-PCR 48 h post transfection. Each cell line transfected with siRNA targeting ... Taken together, these data show that SF3B1 knockdown results in inhibition of cell growth, induction of cell cycle arrest and impairment of erythroid differentiation in myeloid cell lines.  SF3B1 knockdown alters gene expression  To evaluate the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on global gene expression, gene expression profiling was performed in the four myeloid cell lines. For each cell line, we compared the expression profiles of cells treated with two different siRNAs targeting SF3B1 with those of cells treated with a scramble control, 48 h post transfection.  We identified many genes that were up- or downregulated by >2-fold in each cell line treated with SF3B1 siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B). Four genes were upregulated (TFDP1, LOC100505759, MKRN1 and WRNIP1) and five genes were downregulated (ZC3H7A, CREBZF, SGK494, WSB1 and two probesets for SF3B1) in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  Pathway analysis was performed on the up- and downregulated genes in each cell line with SF3B1 knockdown using IPA. Significant deregulation of pathways related to cell cycle regulation was observed in all cell lines and of mTOR signaling and AMPK signaling pathways in three cell lines (Table 1). We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to identify pathways and processes showing coordinated up- or downregulation. Upregulated gene sets include p53 signaling in K562 and SKM1 cells, and several gene sets associated with regulation of transcription, spliceosome and splicing in K562 cells (Supplementary Table S4). Downregulated gene sets associated with the mitochondrial function were found in K562 and TF1 cells, and with cell cycle regulation in SKM1 and HEL cells (Supplementary Table S4). These data show that SF3B1 knockdown in the cell lines studied results in deregulation of many genes and pathways including cell cycle and RNA processing.  Table 1 Table 1 List of significant deregulated pathways in cell lines obtained using IPA SF3B1 knockdown impact on splicing  The genome-wide effects of SF3B1 knockdown on splicing were investigated in two myeloid cell lines (K562 and TF1) using human genome exon-junction arrays. The splicing profile of cells with SF3B1 knockdown (using two different siRNA per cell line) was compared with that of cells transfected with the scramble control.  We observed 2027 differentially expressed exons from 1419 genes, and 507 significant differentially regulated splicing variants (including exon skipping, intron retention and alternative splice sites) of 384 genes in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of CDC7 and SRSF11 in the data from both the cell lines, and of TP53 in TF1 cells. We found a significant overrepresentation of 3′ acceptor splice sites affected by alternative splicing events compared with 5′ donor splice sites (5:1 ratio, P=0.0027, χ2 test with Yates' correction), consistent with the known role of SF3B1 in the recognition of 3′ splice sites. Gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/), and many themes showed significant enrichment of genes affected at the level of exon usage and splice variants (Table 2). Cell cycle and RNA degradation were found to be consistently deregulated at both levels (Table 2). We investigated TP53 differential exon usage by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of gel-extracted bands. We observed exon skipping that was present in the SF3B1 knockdown cells only (Figure 2b).  Table 2 Table 2 Pathway analysis using human genome exon-junction array data at two different levels: differential exon usage and different splicing variant We also investigated whether two cell cycle genes (CCNA2 and STK6) previously shown to be aberrantly spliced in HeLa cells with SF3B1 knockdown,25 were also aberrantly spliced in K562 cells with SF3B1 knockdown in our study. Consistent with the finding in HeLa cells, we observed aberrant splicing of these genes using a qRT-PCR strategy as described previously (Figure 2c and d).25  RNA-Seq in HSPC from MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations  To gain insight into the spectrum of genes that are deregulated or aberrantly spliced in association with SF3B1 mutation in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) of MDS patients, we used deep RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow CD34+ cells from eight MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation (SF3B1 mutants), four MDS patients with no known splicing mutation (wild type) and five healthy controls (control) (Supplementary Table S3). Using IGV, we evaluated the expression of the SF3B1 alleles in SF3B1 mutant cases and observed a range of 45–52% of mutant allele frequency, indicating that both wild-type and mutant alleles were equally expressed (Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Figure S4).  We used edgeR to perform differential gene expression analysis of SF3B1 mutants versus wild type and control. At the whole transcript level, we observed a total of 526 genes (253 upregulated and 273 downregulated) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutants in comparison with wild type (Supplementary Table S5). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutants with control, we found 1823 significantly differentially expressed genes (646 upregulated and 1177 downregulated) (Supplementary Table S6). Genes linked to the pathogenesis of RARS and RCMD-RS, such as ALAS2 and ABCB7, were deregulated (ALAS2 upregulated and ABCB7 downregulated) in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. We also observed upregulation of the mitochondrial genes SLC25A37 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and GLRX5 in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control.  We performed an analysis using 121 genes either known to be expressed in erythroid cells30 or described as erythroid transcription factors in the literature. We found 42 differentially expressed genes (37 upregulated and 5 downregulated) when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control. These included heme biosynthetic enzymes (for example, ALAS2, ALAD, FECH and UROD), globin genes (for example, HBQ1, HBA2, HBB and HBA1) and transcription factors (for example, GATA1, GATA2 and KLF1). In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we found a total of 32 differentially expressed genes (31 upregulated and 1 downregulated) of which 28 were overlapping with the differentially expressed genes found when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control.  We then performed pathway analysis on the significantly differentially expressed genes using IPA. Many pathways, including heme biosynthesis, mitotic roles of polo-like kinase and TNFR2 signaling, were significantly deregulated in the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type (Table 3). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with control, significantly deregulated pathways included apoptosis signaling, p53 signaling, cell cycle regulation and heme degradation (Supplementary Table S7). We next performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysisand many gene sets showing significant enrichment were identified in SF3B1 mutant versus wild type and control. Upregulated gene sets included several that were related to mitochondrial function, cell cycle checkpoints and mRNA splicing. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with control cases, downregulated gene sets included several that were related to cell differentiation and apoptosis (Supplementary Table S8). Many of these deregulated pathways and gene sets are relevant to the known pathophysiology of MDS and in particular of RARS and RCMD-RS.  Table 3 Table 3 Pathway analysis (IPA) of the significant differentially expressed genes between SF3B1 mutant and wild type obtained using edgeR DEXSeq was used to perform differential exon usage analysis of the RNAseq data to evaluate aberrantly spliced genes. At the exon level, we observed a total of 3506 exons (corresponding to 1924 genes) significantly differentially expressed in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (Table 4, Figure 3, Supplementary Table S9). Differential exon usage was observed in at least one exon of genes known to be involved in MDS pathophysiology (TP53 and EZH1), erythroid genes (ALAD, UROD and EPB42) and genes associated with cell cycle (AURKB and CRNDE) and RNA processing (RBM5, RBM25, PRPF40A and HNRNPD). When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type cases, we found 3097 significantly differentially expressed exons (corresponding to 2022 genes) (Table 5, Figure 4, Supplementary Table S10). We found differential exon usage in at least one exon of genes involved in MDS pathophysiology (CBL, ASXL1 and DNMT3A), mitochondrial function (ALAS2, NDUFAF6), erythroid differentiation (NFE2L2, PPOX and HMBS) and mRNA processing (HNRNPD, U2AF2 and PRPF8). Interestingly, UQCC1, a gene involved in mitochondrial biogenesis31 and showing abnormal splicing in SF3B1 mutant cases in uveal melanoma,32 showed differential exon usage and upregulation in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with wild type and control in our study.

Table 4 Table 4 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and control, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq Table 5 Table 5 Top ranking genes showing differential exon usage between SF3B1 mutant and wild type, obtained from RNA sequencing data analysis using DEXSeq To identify pathways affected by differential exon usage, we performed pathway analysis on the genes showing significantly differentially expressed exons using IPA. In the comparison of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, we observed many pathways to be affected, including cell cycle, heme biosynthesis, DNA damage response, mitochondrial and haematopoietic progenitor cells pathway (Supplementary Table S11 and S12). Using DAVID functional annotation tool, we observed significant enrichment of biological themes including alternative splicing, RNA binding, mitochondrion, spliceosome and cell cycle.  Recently, a role for SF3B1 in the maintenance of genomic stability has also been reported where it functions in a DNA damage-induced mRNA splicing complex with BRCA1 and BCLAF1.33 Given that deregulation of the DNA damage response pathway was highlighted by the IPA pathway analysis, we performed an analysis using genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex. Several genes regulated by this complex showed differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (including NUMA1, RB1, CHUK and ABL1) and compared with wild type (NUMA1, PIAS1, SMAD4, BIRC2 and PTK2) (Supplementary Table S13). The overrepresentation of genes regulated by the BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex was significant in SF3B1 mutant compared with control (P<0.001) and compared with wild type (P=0.0498, hypergeometric test). We also found many genes to be affected at the transcript level, including BIRC3, BCL2A1, GYPB, HBB and HBBP1 when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control (Supplementary Table S13).  Go to: Discussion The identification of frequent somatic mutations of SF3B1 in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts suggests a direct correlation between the presence of mutations and this particular phenotype.2, 11, 13 However, the mechanism by which SF3B1 mutation leads to MDS with ring sideroblasts remains to be elucidated.  To illuminate the role of SF3B1 mutation in MDS pathophysiology, we have determined the effects of SF3B1 disruption on cell growth and gene expression in human hematological cells. First, we investigated the effects of SF3B1 knockdown on cell function and gene expression in myeloid cell lines. Second, we used RNA-Seq to study the global gene expression changes and splicing abnormalities associated with the presence of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients.  We have shown that SF3B1 knockdown in four myeloid cell lines resulted in inhibition of cell growth and disruption of the cell cycle. It has recently been reported that Sf3b1+/− mice showed reduced numbers of HSC and compromised reconstitution capacity in lethally irradiated mice.14, 15 Thus, reduced expression of SF3B1 appears to result in impaired cell growth in hematopoietic cells. Similar observations have been made following reduced expression of other splicing factor genes, including U2AF1.3, 4, 34  We used two different microarray platforms to identify genes deregulated at the transcriptional and exon level by SF3B1 knockdown in myeloid cell lines. Gene expression profiling identified many deregulated genes, with four genes consistently upregulated, including TFDP1, and five genes downregulated, including CREBZF, in all four cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown, several of which have a role in the control of cell growth. TFDP1 is involved in the control of transcriptional activity of G1/S cell cycle checkpoint genes,35 and CREBZF is a potent suppressor of cell growth, the effects of which are mediated through the tumor suppressor p53.36 Next, we employed exon-junction arrays to study the transcriptome in K562 and TF1 cells. We identified many differentially expressed exons and differentially regulated splicing variants in cells with SF3B1 knockdown. For example, we observed differential exon usage of the CDC7 and SRSF11 genes, involved in cell cycle regulation and splicing, respectively, and of the TP53 gene. Several pathways including cell cycle, RNA processing, mitochondrion and apoptosis/p53 pathway were consistently deregulated in the cell lines with SF3B1 knockdown.  In summary, our data on myeloid cell lines suggest that the phenotype observed in cells with SF3B1 knockdown is mediated by aberrant splicing and expression of target genes involved in key biological processes.  RNA-Seq is the method of choice for a comprehensive analysis of global gene expression and splicing. In all relevant studies published to date, RNA-Seq has been performed on unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells from a small number of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations (n⩽3 per study), revealing interesting data.11, 37, 38 MDS arise in the HSC, and it is thus of critical importance that the effects of SF3B1 mutation on the transcriptome are studied in the cell of origin. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq on purified bone marrow CD34+ cells from 12 MDS patients, eight with ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutation and four without mutation in other splicing factor genes, and from five healthy controls.  We identified many significantly differentially expressed genes at the transcript level and the exon level when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. CD34+ cells from RCMD-RS and RARS patients display a particular expression profile of mitochondria-related genes;17, 20 we observed upregulation of ALAS2 (heme biosynthesis enzyme) and downregulation of ABCB7 (involved in the transport of iron from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm) in SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control, in agreement with our previous reports.17, 20 SLC25A37, encoding a mitochondrial iron importer, and GLRX5, encoding another mitochondrial protein, were both significantly upregulated in CD34+ cells of SF3B1 mutants compared with wild type and control. A recent study showed SLC25A37 mRNA upregulation in SF3B1 mutant bone marrow mononuclear cells of three MDS patients with RARS/-T.38 Evidence is thus mounting to suggest that upregulation of the iron importer SLC25A37 and downregulation of iron exporter ABCB7 may be linked to the increased mitochondrial iron accumulation observed in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts.39 Deregulation of these genes could also be consistent with an impaired ability of mitochondrial pathways to use iron that may result in an attempt to increase iron availability.  Importantly, we observed many genes associated with porphyrin and heme biosynthesis showing differential exon usage in SF3B1 mutant cases, indicating altered splicing. These include ALAD and UROD when comparing SF3B1 mutant with control and ALAS2 and PPOX when comparing with wild type. We suggest that the aberrant expression and exon usage of mitochondrial and heme-related genes in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation has a role in ring sideroblast formation and abnormal iron homeostasis observed in this patient group. Intriguingly, the most common congenital sideroblastic anemia (X-linked sideroblastic anemia) results from an ALAS2 mutation.40  The relative expression levels of the transcription factors GATA1 and GATA2 differed from normal in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation. The dynamic and strictly regulated change of expression from GATA2 to GATA1 during erythropoiesis has a crucial role,41 and any alteration of this pattern may be predicted to lead to aberrant erythropoiesis. We suggest that the aberrant expression and splicing of erythroid-related genes observed in the CD34+ cells of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation may have a role in the ineffective erythropoiesis found in these patients.  In a previous study, RNA-Seq was used to compare the transcriptome of bone marrow mononuclear cells of two MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation to that of one healthy control.11 One hundred and thirty genes showed significant differential expression, 28 of which overlap with the genes differentially expressed between SF3B1 mutant and control in our study of CD34+ cells. These genes include MAP3K8 and CLEC5A, which have been previously shown to be downregulated in MDS.19, 42 Furthermore, 350 genes showed differential exon usage, and 52 of these were in common with the genes showing differential exon usage in our study of CD34+ cells. The overlapping genes include EZH1, ASXL1, CBL1 and SMAD4.  The mutant forms of ASXL1, CBL and TP53 are known to have an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of MDS, and intriguingly all these genes were found to be alternatively spliced in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations.  A recent study identified a DNA damage-induced BRCA1 protein complex containing BCLAF1 and SF3B1 (BRCA1–BCLAF1–SF3B1 complex).33 In response to DNA damage, the complex regulates pre-mRNA splicing of genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair and hence affects their transcription and pre-mRNA maturation.33 Importantly, we found many of the genes regulated by this complex to be differentially expressed and to show differential exon usage in our study. Genes showing differential transcript level changes included BIRC3 and BCL2A1, whereas NUMA1 showed differential exon usage when comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control. When comparing SF3B1 mutant with wild type, we also found differential exon usage of the PIAS1 gene, a DNA damage response regulator.43, 44 It has been demonstrated that abrogation of members of this complex including BRCA1 and BCLAF1 results in genomic instability,33 a common feature of malignant cells. In MDS patients with mutant SF3B1, the function of this complex may be impaired, with possible downstream effects on the efficiency of DNA damage repair.  Many genes involved in RNA splicing and processing were found to show differential transcript levels, as well as differential exon usage in our study, including HNRNPD, U2AF2, PRPF8 and RBM25. A recent study showed RNA processing genes to be misspliced in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of MDS/AML patients with U2AF1 mutation.45 Intriguingly, there is limited overlap between the genes misspliced as a result of U2AF1 mutation and the RNA processing/splicing genes deregulated/aberrantly spliced in our SF3B1 mutant cases in both comparisons of SF3B1 mutant with wild type and control, suggesting that this process may be affected by different splicing mutations even if their target genes are distinct.  A recent study showed that defects in the splicing factor gene PRPF8 result in missplicing in myeloid malignancies and are associated with the presence of ring sideroblasts in advanced MDS and AML.46 Interestingly, we observed differential exon usage of PRPF8 in SF3B1 mutant cases compared with control in our study, indicating a link between SF3B1 and PRPF8 and the ring sideroblast phenotype. Our finding of differential exon usage of multiple RNA processing/splicing genes in the HSPC of cases with SF3B1 mutation points towards an exacerbation of aberrant splicing, with a wider number of downstream target genes affected. Emerging evidence from our study on SF3B1 and the study on U2AF145 thus supports the hypothesis that in MDS patients harboring splicing factor mutations, there is widespread disruption of the splicing machinery as a consequence of downstream effects of the mutant protein. Loss-of-function mutations in zebrafish Prpf8 have been shown to result in missplicing of TP53.47 We found TP53 to be aberrantly spliced in MDS patients with SF3B1 mutation compared with wild type and control.  Splicing factor mutations, including SF3B1, are considered to be founder mutations and must confer a selective growth advantage to the HSC, but how this occurs remains a mystery. We have identified differential splicing in several genes known to have a role in MDS pathogenesis, including TP53 and ASXL1, as well as genes involved in DNA damage repair, in the HSPC of MDS patients harboring SF3B1 mutations. We suggest that the aberrant splicing of such genes may confer oncogenic properties that help drive the malignant process. In this study, we have determined the target genes of SF3B1 mutations in the HSPC of MDS patients with ring sideroblasts, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying this phenotype.  
220||Antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)—cetuximab and panitumumab—are widely used to treat colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, patients eventually develop resistance to these agents. We describe an acquired EGFR ectodomain mutation (S492R) that prevents cetuximab binding and confers resistance to cetuximab. Cells with this mutation, however, retain binding to and are growth inhibited by panitumumab. Two of ten subjects studied here with disease progression after cetuximab treatment acquired this mutation. A subject with cetuximab resistance harboring the S492R mutation responded to treatment with panitumumab.  Subject terms: Cancer therapeutic resistance Colorectal cancer Tumour biomarkers At a glance Figures First | 1-2 of 2 | Last View all figures left Cetuximab-resistant cells are sensitive to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib and the monoclonal antibody to EGFR panitumumab. Figure 1 Cetuximab-resistant cells harbor a missense mutation (S492R) within the extracellular domain of EGFR. Figure 2 right Main Main• Change history• References• Acknowledgments• Author information• Supplementary information The development of antibodies to EGFR—cetuximab and panitumumab—was a milestone in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treatment. Both of the EGFR antibodies prolong survival in subjects with mCRC and are a standard component of therapy in these individuals. KRAS mutation status predicts an individual's innate resistance to these antibodies, and, because of this, individuals with KRAS-mutant mCRC are excluded from treatment with these antibodies. However, subjects with mCRC who respond to antibodies to EGFR ultimately acquire resistance to these agents1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. To identify the mechanisms of acquired cetuximab resistance, we established cetuximab-resistant cells from the highly sensitive human mCRC cell line DiFi (which is wild-type for KRAS, BRAF and PI3K and has an amplification of EGFR) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Methods). We continuously treated these cells with cetuximab. Five months after beginning treatment, we isolated DiFi-derived cetuximab-resistant clones (DCR) (DCR 7, DCR 9 and DCR 10) (Fig. 1a), which were morphologycally similar to their parental cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). Treatment with cetuximab did not affect the proliferation, apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 2) or EGFR signaling to extracellular-related kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (AKT) (Fig. 1b) in the DCR clones.  Figure 1: Cetuximab-resistant cells are sensitive to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib and the monoclonal antibody to EGFR panitumumab.

Full size image (75 KB) Figures index Next A phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array did not reveal any additional activated RTKs in the DCR clones relative to their parental cells (Supplementary Fig. 3); in addition, we did not detect mutations in KRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA or loss of PTEN expression in the DCR clones (data not shown). Notably, parental DiFi cells and DCR clones were equally sensitive to the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Fig. 1c,d), suggesting that the DCR clones remained dependent on EGFR for their growth and survival. Viability and EGFR signaling in the DCR clones were effectively decreased by treatment with the antibody panitumumab (Fig. 1e,f and Supplementary Fig. 4).  Because treatment with panitumumab blocked EGFR activation by EGF in both cetuximab-sensitive (parental) and cetuximab-resistant (DCR) cells and treatment with cetuximab had this effect only in the parental but not in the DCR cells, we hypothesized that a change in the EGFR cetuximab-binding epitope might have occurred in the DCR clones (Fig. 1g). DNA sequencing of the EGFR coding region (NM_005228.1) revealed a Cright arrowA substitution at nucleotide 1,476 in all three DCR clones that was not present in the parental DiFi cells (Fig. 2a). The parental and DCR cells also harbored previously described single-nucleotide polymorphisms (the EGFR mutations C474T and C2709T) and EGFR gene amplification, confirming that the DCR cells had not arisen from a contaminating subpopulation. C1476A causes a substitution of serine to arginine at amino acid 492, which is within the EGFR ectodomain, and a bulky side chain at this position could interfere with cetuximab binding (Fig. 2b).

NIH 3T3 cells infected with an empty vector (pBABE_EMPTY) were used as control. NIH 3T3 cells were used as negative control (CONTROL). Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting, which revealed similar expression of EGFR in WT EGFR and S492R EGFR mutant cells.

Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies to the indicated proteins.

Full size image (71 KB) Previous Figures index We then expressed wild-type and S492R mutant EGFR in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts lacking endogenous EGFR (Fig. 2c). Both cetuximab and panitumumab inhibited wild-type EGFR activation, whereas in cells carrying the S492R mutation, only panitumumab blocked the activation of EGFR (Fig. 2d). Flow cytometry showed that cetuximab and panitumumab efficiently bound cells expressing wild-type EGFR, but that only panitumumab bound the S942R mutant cells (Fig. 2e). In vitro biochemical binding studies confirmed that the S492R mutant is selectively defective in binding cetuximab but not panitumumab (Fig. 2f).  We did not detect the S492R mutation in 156 tumors analyzed from chemotherapy-naive and targeted-agent–naive subjects with mCRC. We also examined pre- and post-therapy specimens from ten individuals with mCRC who experienced disease progression after a prior response to cetuximab with chemotherapy (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). This study was approved by the local Ethics Board (Clinical Research Ethical Committee of the Parc de Salut Mar, CEIC-IMAS2009/3515/). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. All pre-treatment biopsies were wild type for EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA, except for the biopsy from subject 9, whose tumor harbored a V600E mutation in BRAF. Notably, among the biopsies taken after treatment with cetuximab (post-cetuximab biopsies), we detected the S492R mutation in two subjects (subjects 3 and 9). Whereas subject 9 harbored the same nucleotide change that we saw in the DCRs, the mutation in subject 3 involved a different nucleotide substitution that affected the same codon, an Aright arrowC change at nucleotide 1,474, which also yielded the S492R substitution (Supplementary Fig. 5). We detected the S492R mutation in subject 9 by deep sequencing at a frequency of 3%, as well as by quantitative RT-PCR. Deep sequencing of the DNA sample from subject 3 revealed that the mutation was present at a frequency of 25%. Deep sequencing of normal cells from subjects 3 (saliva) and 9 (colon) revealed only the wild-type sequence, suggesting that the S492R mutation was somatic. Deep sequencing of pre-treatment tumor specimens from both subjects confirmed that the mutation was not detectably present before treatment (data not shown). Both subjects harboring the S492R mutation had EGFR gene amplification (in both their pre- and post-cetuximab specimens) (Supplementary Fig. 6). The post-cetuximab specimen from subject 3 did not harbor known KRAS, BRAF or PIK3CA mutations. The post-cetuximab tumor sample from subject 9 harbored the V600E BRAF mutation, which was also detected in the pre-cetuximab specimen from the same subject.  Subject 9 was exitus at the time of the identification of the S492R mutation in his specimen. In subject 3, detection of the acquired EGFR S492R mutation led us to offer him panitumumab according to the approved monotherapy schedule (6 mg per kg of body weight every 2 weeks). After 2 months of treatment, a computed tomographic scan showed a more than 50% reduction in the volume in all liver lesions (Fig. 2g) in this subject, with a marked decline in the carcinoembryonic antigen blood tumor marker, thereby reinforcing the preclinical data. At month 5 of treatment with panitumumab, subject 3 showed disease progression.  Here we have identified a clinically relevant point mutation within the EGFR extracellular domain that arises during cetuximab therapy and confers resistance to this agent. A missense mutation of the target of a therapeutic antibody has not been previously reported as cause of resistance to that antibody. Notably, the S492R EGFR mutant cell retains the capacity to bind panitumumab. Cetuximab is a chimeric mouse-human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), whereas panitumumab is a fully human IgG2. Clinically, this difference translates into distinct toxicity profiles for each antibody, although both antibodies show similar clinical activity1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and medical oncologists generally consider these two agents to be equivalent therapies. However, the present study reveals an opposite preclinical and clinical response to the two antibodies in the presence of the acquired S492R EGFR mutation. This mutation may provide a molecular explanation for the clinical benefit of panitumumab in a subset of subjects with mCRC who do not respond to treatment with cetuximab7, and these findings have substantial immediate clinical implications for persons with mCRC. The specificity of the S492R mutation is expected to facilitate reliable testing to guide the clinical use of panitumumab after cetuximab failure and justifies prospective independent validation of the S492R EGFR mutation. It will also be of interest to determine whether this mutation contributes to the acquisition of cetuximab resistance in other tumor types. 
306||The DNA entry and exit points on the nucleosome core regulate the initial invasion of the nucleosome by factors requiring access to the underlying DNA. Here we describe in vivo consequences of eliminating a single protein–DNA interaction at this position through mutagenesis of histone H3 Lys 42 to alanine. This substitution has a dramatic effect on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome in both the transcriptional output and landscape of mRNA species produced. We attribute this in part to decreased histone H3 occupancy at transcriptionally active loci, leading to enhanced elongation. Additionally we show that this lysine is methylated in vivo, and genetic studies of methyl-lysine mimics suggest that this modification may be crucial in attenuating gene expression. Interestingly, this site of methylation is unique to Ascomycota, suggesting a recent evolutionary innovation that highlights the evolvability of post-translational modifications of chromatin.  Keywords: evolution, histone methylation, transcription elongation, transcriptional output, yeast Nucleosomes, the octameric histone protein complex wrapped by 147 base pairs (bp) of DNA, are core components of chromatin in eukaryotes. At a molecular level, the nucleosome crystal structure shows that there are 14 DNA–histone interactions within the core particle, positioned at each minor groove (Luger et al. 1997). Twelve of these interactions are mediated by histone fold motifs of all four histone proteins, and the remaining two involve residues in the histone H3 αN helix at the DNA entry and exit points. Although the majority of these interactions are mediated by nonspecific electrostatics between the DNA and protein backbones, important positively charged histone side chains have also been shown to play a role (Luger and Richmond 1998). Recently, it has been shown in vitro that not all histone–DNA interactions within the nucleosome are of equal strength. Using an optical trapping method, Hall et al. (2009) mapped the strongest interactions to three precise locations on the nucleosome core, including the dyad axis, and ±40 bp on either side of this.  The different classes of intranucleosomal interactions illustrate how the cell can tune the stability of the nucleosome by reinforcing or destabilizing these interactions, thus controlling the timing and extent of accessibility of the underlying DNA. Various proteins and complexes are recruited to chromatin to alter nucleosome stability either temporally or spatially throughout the genome, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, histone variant proteins, and enzymes that chemically modify histone amino acid side chains. (for review, see Hartzog er al. 2002; Li et al. 2007; Clapier and Cairns 2009). The question then arises as to which structurally important interactions defining nucleosome stability at a molecular level are targeted by these processes.  First, it is known that modification of histone residues is quite complex. Modification of residues lying both at the N termini of histone proteins and within the globular core perturbs the formation of higher-order chromatin structure by influencing electrostatic interactions, and through interactions with specific information “readers” (Watanabe et al. 2010). Second, it has been suggested that the residues at the dyad axis are targeted by chromatin remodeling enzymes, because introducing histone mutations in this region (so-called “SIN alleles”) facilitated transcription of genes that typically require chromatin remodeling in the absence of the ATP-dependent factors (Kruger et al. 1995; Recht and Osley 1999) and lead to nucleosome instability in vitro (Kurumizaka and Wolffe 1997). Furthermore, residues at/close to the dyad axis in the nucleosome do not tolerate mutagenesis well, as these positions are overrepresented in collections of lethal histone mutations (Dai et al. 2008; Nakanishi et al. 2008). Third, it has been shown that certain mutations in histone H3 resulted in the formation of spurious transcription from intragenic locations (Cheung et al. 2008), suggesting that the role of the wild-type residue may be to prevent nucleosome destabilization at the 3′ end of ORFs. These residues are located close to the dyad axis as well as at the base of the histone H3 αN helix.  In this study, we sought to understand the contribution of the DNA entry and exit points to nucleosome function in vivo and ascertain whether it plays a dynamic role in controlling the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA. In the crystal structure, the DNA at this region is organized exclusively by the histone H3 αN helix, and a single residue, Lys 42, within this helix interacts directly with DNA by inserting its side chain between the two DNA gyres. In spite of the fact that it has been shown that this interaction is comparatively weak within the nucleosome (Hall et al. 2009), we know from in vitro studies that mutating this residue makes purified nucleosomes inherently more mobile (Somers and Owen-Hughes 2009). We studied the H3-K42A mutation, and, although not a lethal substitution in vivo, yeast cells harboring this histone mutant as the sole source of histone H3 grow slowly and display a variety of phenotypes. The most striking observation is vastly increased transcriptional output of H3-K42A-expressing cells. Surprisingly, this residue is a substrate for methylation, and our data support a role for this modification in transcriptional repression. We therefore identified a critical interaction within the nucleosome that is targeted to fine-tune gene expression, and we propose that K42, and possibly its modification, serves as a structural “gatekeeper” of transcription. Remarkably, K42 is a “young” lysine evolutionarily; in most other eukaryotes, this residue is an arginine, suggesting recent evolution of its thus-far unidentified methylation machinery.  Go to: Results Histone H3-K42A mutants are pleiotropic in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Histone H3-K42 is a crucial residue that mediates the sole DNA contact of the nucleosome at the DNA entry and exit positions. (Fig. 1A). In the crystal structure (White et al. 2001), the K42 side chain is positioned in the solvent-exposed space between the two DNA helices. Its ɛ amino group points away from the nucleosome core and forms two hydrogen bonds with the phosphodiester backbone (Fig. 1B). To assess the contribution of these interactions to nucleosome function, we mutated this lysine residue to alanine, eliminating hydrogen bond potential (Fig. 1C), and performed phenotypic analyses.  Figure 1. Figure 1. Histone H3-K42A is a pleiotropic mutation, which disrupts a structurally important nucleosome surface. (A) The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae nucleosome highlighting histone H3 Lys 42 (orange) positioned at the DNA entry and exit points. The figure ... H3-K42A cells grow almost twice as slowly as wild-type yeast (data not shown). We scored the viability of this mutant under different conditions and found it was sensitive to (1) the DNA-damaging agents hydroxyurea (HU) and methyl-methanesulfonate; (2) benomyl, the microtubule-destabilizing drug; (3) 6-azauracil (6AU), a drug that interferes with transcription; and (4) temperatures >39°C (Fig. 1D). It did not display growth defects in the presence of camptothecin, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, or cold temperatures (data not shown). The pleiotropic behavior of H3-K42A indicates that this residue either is directly critical for numerous cellular processes, or its affect on nucleosome structure indirectly influences multiple pathways, possibly by influencing target gene expression. To test this, we analyzed the transcript profile of cells harboring H3-K42A. Strikingly, in these cells, we found that the expression of ∼42% of genes was altered in comparison with wild-type cells, with the majority of these (90%) up-regulated (Fig. 1E). The average fold increase for affected genes was two; the expression of a subset of loci was altered up to 12-fold above wild-type levels. No specific gene classes (based on Gene Ontology [GO] terms) were preferentially perturbed by histone H3-K42A (Supplemental Fig. S1). Additionally, no correlation was observed between chromosome location and transcriptional response to the H3-K42A substitution (data not shown).  We next examined whether these effects were specific to K42A or whether mutating other residues close to this nucleosome location exhibited similar phenotypes. We know that this region is important for faithful mitotic chromosome segregation, serving as a docking site for the recruitment of Sgo1p to pericentromeric regions during mitosis (Luo et al. 2010). This explains why mutations in this region, including K42A, are benomyl-sensitive, which is suppressed by overexpressing SGO1 (data not shown). We found that, although the H3-K42 region mutants do not confer 6AU sensitivity, we did observe increased expression of certain genes in these strains (Supplemental Fig. S2). However, the extent of this effect is nonuniform, and K42A exhibits the most severe transcriptional phenotype. Taken together, these observations highlight the structural importance and functionality of this nucleosome location and suggest that H3-K42 is a key residue within this region in transcriptional regulation.  Histone H3-K42A profoundly alters the S. cerevisiae transcriptome  To probe mechanisms underlying the potential role of this nucleosome surface during transcription, we sought to understand the hypertranscription phenotype of H3-K42A. The microarray analysis indicated that H3-K42A does not lead to erroneous derepression of transcription genome-wide, as the majority of genes typically repressed under the conditions tested were unaffected by H3-K42A. Therefore, we hypothesized that H3-K42A influences an active transcription cycle, and thus analyzed the dynamic expression of a single inducible locus: MET16. Our results indicate that the initial appearance of MET16 mRNA under inducing conditions was unaltered in H3-K42A cells, suggesting that regulation of the first round of transcription initiation is unaffected. However, MET16 transcript overaccumulates with time in the mutant cells (Fig. 2A), consistent with a defect in establishing a proper set point for transcription rate or inefficient transcription termination (Fig. 2A). MET16 expression level is not affected under repressive conditions, supporting the hypothesis that the effect of K42A depends on transcriptional activation (Fig. 2A).  Figure 2. Figure 2. Histone H3-K42A alters the S. cerevisiae transcriptome. (A) Kinetics of appearance of MET16 mRNA in cells expressing wild-type (WT) or K42A histone H3, as described in the Materials and Methods. Error bars represent the standard deviation between two ... To gain a higher resolution of the hypertranscription phenotype, we examined the length of RNA species produced in K42A cells transcriptome-wide. We hybridized total RNA extracted from mutant cells to the Affymetrix genomic tiling array, which interrogates the yeast genome at 5-bp resolution. A methodology was employed that identifies stretches of RNA that extend beyond the length of wild-type transcripts as well as differential RNA lengths within an ORF (Poorey et al. 2010). Strikingly, we found that ∼30% of all transcripts analyzed deviated from their expected length in H3-K42A cells (Supplemental Table S1). The majority (61%) of these transcripts also displayed increased abundance in the K42A microarray data set. The distribution of actual base pair length change was broad, ranging from 101 bp to 19,196 bp (median = 902 bp). Altered-length transcripts are categorized relative to the ORF of the affected locus as 5′ extensions, 5′ truncations, 3′ truncations, and 3′ extensions. Figure 2B shows that the K42A data set was significantly enriched for both 5′ and 3′ extensions, although truncation events were also detected. Significant overlap was seen between the 5′ and 3′ extension events, indicating that both events occur at the same locus with high frequency in K42A cells (Fig. 2C). A representative example of a transcript length change is shown in Figure 2D for YBR040W, a gene up-regulated 12-fold by H3-K42A. At this single locus, the transcript in K42A cells displayed both 5′ and 3′ extensions. This analysis indicates that H3-K42A drastically alters not only the amplitude, but also the “quality” of the yeast transcriptome.  Hypertranscription phenotype depends on elongation factors  Chromatin negatively impacts many aspects of transcription, and a wide variety of complex mechanisms exist to overcome this obstacle. Based on our analysis of MET16 expression, we hypothesized that histone H3-K42A influences the function of one or more such protein(s) in an event downstream from transcription initiation. We studied transcription component knockouts to probe how K42A elicits its transcriptional effects. We chose 20 nonessential gene mutants known to play roles in the initiation and elongation phases and initially scored their ability to influence K42A 6AU sensitivity. Our results indicate that the K42A 6AU phenotype was specifically suppressed by the deletion of the elongation factors SET2, ELC1, or RCO1 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, we found no genetic interactions between K42A and a series of genes involved primarily in transcription initiation, such as SET1, GCN5, GAL11, and BRE1 (data not shown). Table 1 lists all of the genes tested in this analysis.  Table 1. Table 1. Suppression analysis of histone H3-K42A through perturbations of transcription-related complexes Figure 3. Figure 3. Histone H3-K42 is an important residue during transcription elongation. (A) Strains with the indicated genotypes were plated as described in the Materials and Methods to detect transcriptional elongation defects. (B) Quantitative RT–PCR analysis ... As certain elongation factor deletions are themselves sensitive to 6AU—such as dst1Δ and paf1Δ, for example—we sought additional evidence for the ability of elongation factors to suppress K42A-mediated hypertranscription. We employed quantitative RT–PCR to monitor the expression of three specific loci up-regulated by H3-K42A: YBR040W, YNR062C, and YKL221W. We found that deletions of SET2, DST1, RCO1, or PAF1 completely reversed the ability of H3-K42A to increase transcription of these genes (Fig. 3B). These interactions are consistent with the idea that K42A hypertranscription reflects hyperelongation. If we explain the 6AU sensitivity of K42A as the inability of these cells to generate essential transcripts when nucleotide pools are decreased, perhaps a direct consequence of the extent of genome-wide hypertranscription, then mutations that decrease elongation rates will allow those nucleotides to be used more effectively and restore growth in the presence of 6AU. In contrast, although elc1Δ suppressed the 6AU phenotype of K42A, this strain did not alter the expression pattern of the three test genes. It was also noted that ubp8Δ, a gene involved in the transition between transcription initiation and elongation, had a slight but reproducible suppressive effect in both assays tested (Fig. 3B; data not shown).  Since SET2 is the histone methyltransferase for H3-K36, a residue in close proximity to H3-K42, we tested whether substitutions at H3-K36 would also suppress K42A and found that H3-K36A suppressed K42A slow growth and hypertranscription phenotypes as well as its 6AU sensitivity both in cis and in trans (Fig. 3A; data not shown).  These genetic data show a striking pattern: The H3-K42A phenotypes are specifically suppressed by a subset of elongation factor mutants, suggesting that the mode of action of this allele may be to induce hyperelongation or uncontrolled elongation. The altered elongation rate might in turn explain the altered 3′ end formation observed in >1000 different genes. To test this hypothesis, we determined the levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) actively involved in elongation as opposed to initiation by analyzing the phosphorylation status of its C-terminal domain (CTD). Ser 2 phosphorylation of the CTD is a hallmark of the elongating RNAPII; immunoblot analysis indicated that the levels of this modification were increased in K42A-expressing cells compared with the wild type. In contrast, CTD phosphorylation at Ser 5 is important during transcription initiation; K42A did not affect this modification significantly (Fig. 3C).  Histone H3-K42A alters chromatin structure at actively transcribed genes  Data presented thus far suggest a potential role for H3-K42 in negatively regulating transcription elongation and support the removal of this inhibitory effect by the K42A substitution. Given that nucleosomes harboring a mutation at this site display increased mobility in vitro, we hypothesized that the K42A phenotype may be due to a direct effect on chromatin structure. Figure 2A shows that H3-K42A increases the levels of MET16 expression under inducing conditions specifically, indicating that activated transcription is necessary to reveal the K42A phenotype. Therefore, we hypothesized that K42A-containing nucleosomes give rise to an altered chromatin template that is more permissive to transcription once initiated. We determined the occupancy of histone H3 at genes up-regulated by the H3-K42A mutation by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), as a decrease in nucleosome density across a gene would promote transcription. Additionally, the generation of 5′ truncated transcripts, as seen in K42A cells, has been accounted for previously by the lack of restoration of a repressive chromatin state in the wake of RNAPII elongation (Carrozza et al. 2005; Joshi and Struhl 2005; Keogh et al. 2005). Figure 3D indicates that there is a significant loss of histone H3 at these loci in K42A cells. Interestingly, in two out of the three genes tested, this difference was evident only at the 3′ end of the ORF. There was no detectable difference in H3 occupancy at genes that are unresponsive to K42A; namely, ACT1, inactivated MET16, and an intergenic noncoding locus in K42A cells (data not shown).  During transcription, nucleosomes are continuously disassembled and reassembled by histone chaperones to facilitate the passage of RNAPII along a gene while maintaining a closed state to prevent aberrant initiation (Schwabish and Struhl 2004; Kulaeva et al. 2007). Spt6p is an essential histone chaperone that binds histone H3 and is important for replacing histone H3/H4 tetramers behind RNAPII. Cells expressing a temperature-sensitive (ts) allele of SPT6, spt6-1004, display phenotypes very similar to that of H3-K42A at semipermissive conditions with respect to transcription up-regulation, decreased nucleosome density in gene coding regions, intragenic transcription, and temperature sensitivity (Kaplan et al. 2003; Cheung et al. 2008). Based on these similarities, we hypothesized that the phenotypes associated with K42A result from defects in the SPT6 pathway, and, accordingly, we expected no exacerbation of the common phenotypes when both alleles are combined. We integrated the spt6-1004 allele into our histone knockout strain background and observed no enhancement of spt6-1004 temperature sensitivity by H3-K42A. Furthermore, mRNA length changes in spt6-1004 cells were not altered in the presence of K42A and at either permissive or semipermissive temperatures (Supplemental Fig. S4).  Histone H3-K42 is dimethylated in S. cerevisiae.  During the course of this work, our ongoing proteomic effort to identify novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the globular core of nucleosomes revealed, to our surprise, that histone H3-K42 can be methylated in yeast. We detected both monomethyl and dimethyl forms of K42 using electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in three independent samples (Fig. 4A).  Figure 4. Figure 4. Histone H3-K42 is dimethylated in S. cerevisiae. (A) Electrospray tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS) of the doubly charged dimethylated peptide: YK(dimet.)PGTVALR, m/z 516.869, recorded using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer in an LC-MS/MS experiment ... Residue 42 is an arginine in all other eukaryotes except Ascomycota (Supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that, if this lysine is indeed modified, the methylation machinery must be newly evolved. With considerable skepticism, we raised an antibody against a K42 dimethyl-containing peptide. With such an antiserum in hand, experiments to probe for this modification in S. cerevisiae by an independent method became possible. The dot blot in Figure 4B indicates the specificity of this antibody in recognizing the dimethyl-modified histone peptide over the unmodified using competition assays with specific and control unmodified peptides. Immunoblot analyses (Fig. 4C) supported the specificity of the antibody and the existence in vivo of dimethylation of H3-K42 (H3-K42me2). These data illustrate that the serum detects its antigen in both purified histones and whole-cell protein extracts from yeast expressing wild-type histone H3, but fails to detect histone H3 from strains harboring mutations at residue 42 or unmodified bacterially expressed yeast histone H3. Additionally, the modified band in the immunoblot could be competed away by addition of either a monomethyl or dimethylated histone peptide, but not trimethyl or unmodified control peptides.  Histone H3-K42 methylation is enriched at the 5′ end of genes  In our efforts to characterize histone H3-K42me2, we undertook ChIP-on-chip analysis using the methyl-specific antibody to probe for the localization of this modification across the yeast genome. Histone H3-K42 dimethylation was significantly enriched at 491 genome locations distributed seemingly randomly across all 16 S. cerevisiae chromosomes (at a false discovery rate [FDR] threshold of <0.1). The modification was enriched in intragenic regions (65%); however, a substantial proportion was also located in intergenic regions (35%). Figure 4D shows the distribution of H3-K42me2 averaged genome-wide across all genes, indicating enrichment in the 5′ half of genes.  Establishing a genetic system to probe the possible function of histone H3-K42me2  We next sought in vivo evidence for the functionality of this modification in yeast. The H3-K42A mutation eliminates this modification in cells, and therefore the phenotypes associated with this substitution give us some insight into the effects of losing H3-K42me2. However, alanine is not a conservative substitution and, as stated previously, in addition to preventing K42 methylation, it also eliminates potential K42 hydrogen bonding with DNA. We therefore mutated K42 to arginine to mimic a constitutively nonmethylated form of K42 while maintaining hydrogen-bonding potential. Unfortunately, this allele displayed no detectable phenotypes in any assay tested (Fig. 5A; data not shown). We rationalized that perhaps arginine can act a substrate for methylation at this site, supported by the presence of arginine at this position in all other eukaryotes. However, we were unsuccessful in detecting methylation at this site in cells by mass spectrometry. Therefore, we chose to use K42Q as a surrogate for a demethylated version of K42, as it cannot be methylated but is predicted to retain the H bond to DNA (Supplemental Fig. S6).  Figure 5. Figure 5. Histone H3-K42me2 may play a role in transcription. (A) Strains expressing the indicated histone H3 allele were assayed for their sensitivity to 6AU to detect transcription elongation defects. ppr1Δ acts as a positive control for comparison. ( ... A complementary approach that is widely used to determine the contribution of a PTM in vivo is to generate a mutation at the site that mimics a constitutively modified state. The closest natural mimics to a methylated lysine are leucine and methionine, which represent monomethyl and dimethyl side chains, respectively. Structures of nucleosomes predicted by energy minimization (Guex and Peitsch 1997) harboring these substitutions are illustrated in Supplemental Figure S6. Although the length of the side chains of the substituted amino acids do not extend as far as lysine, their solvent exposure seems unaltered, and it could be argued that the recognition of their functional groups is similar to that of the modified and unmodified native residues. In particular, the solvent-exposed side chain terminal dimethyl of leucine has a contour strikingly similar to that of dimethyl lysine.  Histone H3-K42me2 may regulate transcription  We generated strains that expressed either H3-K42Q, H3-K42L, or H3-K42M as their sole source of histone H3 and monitored their phenotypes. Initially we determined each strains' sensitivity to 6AU, and Figure 5A shows that our data are consistent with the modification status dictating the sensitivity to this drug. Cells expressing the unmodified mimic K42Q behaved like K42A and were sensitive to the drug, whereas cells expressing the modified mimics K42L and K42M were unaffected by 6AU.  To ask whether the effect of K42A on transcription might be related to H3-K42 modification state, we analyzed K42Q and K42L transcript profiles. Histone H3-K42Q altered expression of ∼25% of the genome and, as in K42A-expressing cells, the majority (∼77%) of these genes were up-regulated. K42L, however, had a more modest phenotype, resulting in dysregulation of only 7% of the genome. Strikingly, however, the major effect of K42L was to down-regulate gene expression (Table 2). We next determined the number and identity of target genes common to the three profiling experiments (Fig. 5B). There was high concordance between genes affected by both K42A and K42Q and the direction of change in expression of these genes. One-hundred-thirty-five genes were affected by all three alleles: K42A, K42Q, and K42L. Whereas the direction of change in these genes was concordant in K42A and K42Q, ∼40% of the genes were oppositely regulated by K42L. Additionally, almost all genes common to the K42A and K42L data sets were differentially regulated by each mutation. Collectively, these data support a model in which K42 methylation is a repressive mark for transcription.  Table 2. Table 2. Summary of microarray analysis of the indicated histone H3-K42 mutants A more direct test of this model is to compare the loci that are enriched by K42 methylation, as determined by our ChIP-on-chip experiment, and those genes whose expression was dysregulated by K42 alleles. Consistent with K42 methylation acting to inhibit transcription, we found significant overlap between genomic regions containing this modification and the loci up-regulated by both K42A (P-value = 1.6 × 10−4) and K42Q (P-value = 3.1 × 10−6) substitutions, both of which mimic a lack of K42me2. Consistently, the relatively few genes that showed decreased expression in the presence of K42A or K42Q did not show significant enrichment of H3-K42me2, consistent with these representing secondary effects. Furthermore, we found that loci down-regulated by the constitutively methylated mimic K42L were significantly enriched for nucleosomes containing H3-K42me2 (P-value = 1.3 × 10−4).  Given our knowledge that H3-K42A causes mRNA length changes, we asked whether other K42 alleles displayed a similar effect. Specifically, we determined the ability of K42 mutations to initiate transcription at a site downstream from the natural start site. We used a reporter in which the HIS3 ORF was driven by the intragenic cryptic promoter in the FLO8 gene (Fig. 5C; Cheung et al. 2008) and assayed the ability of K42 mutants to grow in the absence of histidine. Our results indicate that, similar to K42A, the demethylated H3-K42 mimic K42Q was capable of inducing cryptic promoter–HIS3 expression, whereas K42L, the constitutively methylated mimic, was not—consistent with a potential role for H3-K42me2 in preventing erroneous transcription (Fig. 5C).  Components of the PAF1 complex influence histone H3-K42 dimethylation  The transcript-profiling studies of the different K42 alleles suggested that methylation of this site may be important in the regulation of transcription, and our genetic investigations into the K42A allele implied a role for the modification during transcription elongation. To directly test this hypothesis, we determined whether strains with defects in transcription elongation might signal through H3-K42me2 and perturb the abundance of this modification. We quantified the levels of H3-K42me2 in 87 deletion strains that either lacked a known nonessential transcription elongation factor or were known to be sensitive to 6AU (Supplemental Table S2). Strikingly, the only strains that showed any effect on the levels of H3-K42me2 were those lacking a component of the PAF1 elongation complex. ctr9Δ and hpr1Δ showed statistically significant decreases in H3-K42me2 and rtf1Δ displayed a modest defect in this modification. ccr4Δ, paf1Δ, and spt13Δ displayed elevated levels (up to threefold that of wild type) of this methyl mark (Fig. 5D).  Go to: Discussion Comprehensive histone mutagenesis in yeast has shown that the DNA entry/exit point of the nucleosome does not tolerate substitutions. We identified a group of histone H3 residues in this location that influence transcription, the most critical among them being Lys 42. We showed that the integrity of K42 is essential to maintain the correct transcriptional output in a yeast cell, potentially explaining why certain mutations at this site are pleiotropic. This is a novel site of methylation in yeast: We used a K42-methyl-specific antibody in conjunction with a genetic approach to probe the function and biological significance of this modification. Given its nucleosomal location and the results of our studies, we believe that K42, and possibly its methylation, acts as a transcriptional “gatekeeper” by limiting access to nucleosomal DNA during transcriptional elongation.  The histone H3-K42A substitution results in the abundance of many transcripts, as well as substantial effects on the lengths of many mRNAs. Considering how the elongating RNAPII is influenced by many negative factors, not least the chromatin template, and that it is not uncommon for this massive complex to halt, stall, or become completely arrested (for review, see Shilatifard 2004), we believe that chromatin containing K42A is intrinsically less restrictive to the elongating RNAPII protein complex because the “gate is constitutively open,” promoting more efficient elongation. The two most prominent changes in mRNA length that we detected in K42A cells are those that generate 5′ and 3′ extensions, indicating that the effect of K42A-containing nucleosomes extends beyond canonical transcriptional units. The inability of transcription to be terminated may reflect the permissiveness of K42A chromatin to elongating RNAPII. We hypothesize that, once RNAPII is engaged in transcription, the chromatin landscape in K42A cells is sufficient to promote elongation through normal stop signals even in the presence of transcription-terminating factors. In support of this, our data show that, in K42A cells, we detected an increase in elongation-competent RNAPII, as monitored by increased Ser 2 phosphorylation of the CTD. Furthermore, we found that, by deleting positive elongation factors, the hypertranscription phenotype of K42A was suppressed. For example, DST1 is required to re-engage stalled RNAPII (Christie et al. 1994; Kulish, Struhl 2001); by eliminating DST1, we decreased the number of RNAPII complexes that complete transcripts, thereby masking K42A phenotypes. Similar results were seen for mutants of PAF1, an RNAPII-associated protein required to recruit proelongation factors to actively transcribed genes, including Rad6p (Wood et al. 2003), Dot1p (Krogan et al. 2003), and the FACT complex (for review, see Jaehning 2010). Since our tiling array analysis does not assign strand specificity, ambiguity exists when transcripts span multiple loci and, consequently, ∼30% of 5′ extensions could be classified as 3′ extensions of an upstream locus resulting from hyperelongation (Supplemental Fig. S7). Additionally, our data indicate that K42A cells do not induce expression of repressed genes, illustrating that K42A chromatin does not generically promote ectopic recruitment of initiation complexes genome-wide. These data, taken together with the fact that deleting nonessential initiation factors did not alter K42A phenotypes, suggest that aberrant transcription elongation efficiency specifically underlies K42A-mediated transcriptional phenotypes.  What are the mechanisms behind the “open gate” state of nucleosomes in K42A cells? Our ChIP analyses reveal that there is a loss of histone H3 in K42A cells at certain actively transcribed genes, which is more apparent at the 3′ end of the ORF. We also provided genetic evidence suggesting that both K42A and spt6-1004, a Ts− mutation in the histone chaperone Spt6p, feed into the same pathway and are mechanistically similar. This raises the hypothesis that the histone H3-containing K42A mutation may not be redeposited efficiently in the wake of RNAPII elongation. However, this explanation alone is insufficient to account for the greater number of transcripts affected by K42A cells than in spt6-1004. We speculate that the permissiveness of elongation in K42A cells may arise from inefficient redeposition of histone H3 in conjunction with increased mobility of K42A nucleosomes, as evidenced in vitro.  Our discovery that H3-K42 is methylated in yeast corroborates the importance of this nucleosome residue, providing us with a mechanism by which a cell regulates this transcriptional gatekeeper. The contrasting transcript profiles of methyl (K42L) and nonmethyl (K42Q) mimics of K42 provide indirect evidence to support such a mechanism. Furthermore, we saw a direct effect on methylation levels in mutants with a defective Paf1 complex. This suggests that perturbations to elongation, specifically through the Paf1 complex pathway, influence K42me2 abundance, placing this modification in the Paf1 pathway. The exact mechanism underlying the pattern of H3-K42me2 variations in the individual Paf1 complex subunit deletions is likely to be complex, although it is attractive to speculate that the Paf1 complex is necessary for the recruitment of the elusive K42-specific methyltransferase. In support of this notion, deletion of PAF1 leads to both initiation of transcription at intragenic cryptic promoters (Chu et al. 2007) and 3′ extensions of certain mRNAs (Penheiter et al. 2005; Sheldon et al. 2005), similar to H3-K42A.  Residue 42 in histone H3 is arginine in most other braches of eukaryotes, including Basidiomycetes (Supplemental Fig. S6), indicating that the lysine substitution appeared within the last 400 million years, after Ascomycota and Basidiomycota diverged. Therefore, H3-K42me2 is not a conserved modification, and, strikingly, the ability to methylate this residue is a very recent innovation in evolution, possibly through neo- or subfunctionalization of a conserved enzyme. To explore what protein might have evolved such a function, we searched for a K42-specific methyltransferase in yeast. Unfortunately, to date, our efforts have proved futile, as individual deletion of all 62 known annotated methyltransferases in yeast, including all SET domain proteins and Dot1p, failed to abolish H3-K42me2, as detected by immunoblotting (data not shown). From this analysis, we assume that Ascomycetes have co-opted a noncanonical methyltransferase to methylate H3-K42, or, alternatively, redundant enzymes may modify K42.  Although the prevalence of K42me2 histones throughout the genome is limited, as illustrated by our ChIP-on-chip data, this might indicate that there was a selective advantage to yeast in acquiring this novel modification at those particular sites. It is attractive to interpret the K42A and K42Q mutant data as reflecting the loss of H3-K42me2, and that the ability of the cell to regulate the transcriptional output may be the selective pressure driving the evolution of the modification. In support of this idea, there is a correlation between genes affected by nonmethyl mimics K42A and K42Q and those enriched with the modification. Additionally, these alleles permit the production of intragenic transcripts, whereas the methyl-mimic K42L suppresses it. Although it has been shown that additional nucleosome core mutations promote intragenic transcription, our study illustrates how this phenomenon may be regulated within the cell by PTM. One tempting model might be that H3-K43me2 regulates the interaction between Spt6p and histone H3.  To uncover alternative sources of selective pressure promoting histone H3-K42me2 evolution, we took a bioinformatic approach and looked for differences in specific chromatin-related proteins between the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, the latter lacking H3-K42. One potentially relevant candidate is the linker histone, H1, which binds DNA at the nucleosome entry and exit points (Thoma et al. 1979), stabilizing the nucleosome and restricting transcription in most eukaryotes. However, S. cerevisiae and other Ascomycetes species lack a canonical H1 protein. Given that histone H3-K42 is positioned in the same nucleosomal region, and our data suggest a role for H3-K42me in transcriptional inhibition, it is plausible that Ascomycota have evolved this modification to serve the function of canonical histone H1. In support of this, our sequence analysis showed that histone H1 divergence largely conforms to phylogeny; H1 sequences from different Basidiomycetes species are more similar than those from Ascomycetes. Similarly, we found that the fungal distribution of a second protein, HP-1, and, presumably, the histone H3-K9 methylation system that generates the repressive chromatin mark that it recognizes follow a similar pattern. Interestingly, in this example, Ascomycetes species lack any detectable homolog of HP-1. These preliminary findings suggest that the lack of canonical histone H1 and/or H3-K9 methylation in Ascomycota could have driven the evolution of a novel repressive chromatin mark, H3-K42me2. Future experiments will be required to directly test this hypothesis.  If we assume that the lack of conservation of this site among higher eukaryotes implies that K42 methylation is a recent acquisition of Ascomycota, we conclude that its function in attenuating transcriptional output provides an evolutionary advantage to these species. We know that, under certain growth conditions, wild-type yeast actively produce cryptic transcripts that play physiological roles (Ono et al. 2005; Bickel and Morris 2006), and that certain intragenic transcripts can be translated into functional proteins, increasing the complexity of the yeast proteome, perhaps providing the cell with additional capabilities and functions. Given that up to 17% of genes within the yeast genome contain intragenic cryptic initiation sites, regulatory mechanisms must be in place to modulate the extent of this form of pervasive transcription, perhaps limiting it temporally or under certain conditions. Methylation of the gate to the globular core of the nucleosome at histone H3-K42 is one such mechanism.  Go to: Materials and methods Strains and media  Standard laboratory techniques for budding yeast manipulations were used. The previously described yeast strain JPY12 (Park et al. 2002) was the parental strain employed for all genetic manipulations unless otherwise noted. A uracil auxotrophy derivative of JPY12, EMHY510, was generated. EMHY510 used in 6AU growth assay was transformed with the URA3 CEN plasmid pRS316. Deletion strains of JPY12 were made using a PCR product amplified from the appropriate BY4742 strain of the KanMX deletion collection. Colony PCR was used to verify the correct integration of the knockout cassette in JPY12. Supplemental Table S3 contains a complete list of strains generated. The Ts− allele of SPT6, spt6-1004, was integrated in EMHY510 by transformation with the SphI-linearized form of the integrating plasmid pCK125 and selecting on synthetic complete (SC)–Ura. Ura+ transformants were streaked to YPD, replica-plated to 5FOA, and subsequently screened for a Ts− phenotype at 39°C. Colony PCR was used to verify the correct targeting of the Ts− alleles.  All media were supplemented with 0.64 mM adenine. SC medium contained 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB, Difco), 2% (w/v) glucose, and 2% (w/v) bacto-agar, supplemented with 2% (w/v) “Hopkins mix” amino acids. HU medium was prepared by supplementing SC with 200 mM HU. Benomyl was added to YPD-rich medium at a concentration of 30 μg/mL. 6AU-containing medium was SC–Ura containing 200 μg/mL 6AU.  Plasmids  Plasmids pDM18 (Park et al. 2002) and pEMH7 (Hyland et al. 2005) carrying HHT2 and HHF2 and pJP11 encoding HHT1 and HHF1 were used in this study. pEMH17 was generated whereby the NaeI/SacI fragment from pEMH7 was excised and subcloned into pRS315. Histone H3 mutants were engineered into pEMH7, as described previously (Hyland et al. 2005). Plasmids were sequenced with oligonucleotides JB6505 and JB6504. Plasmid pBS4 harboring histone H3-K36A mutation was obtained from B. Strahl. The integrating plasmid pCK125 harboring spt6-1004 was provided by F. Winston.  Growth assays  Yeast strains used in growth assays were grown overnight in either YPD or selective medium where appropriate. The next day, cultures were diluted to an OD A600 of 0.5, and fivefold serial dilutions were plated on both growth control plates and experimental plates. Plates were photographed after 2 d of incubation at 30°C.  Intragenic transcript detection  The FLO8 intragenic reporter was generated by V. Cheng and F. Winston. The reporter construct (4.5 kb) was amplified from strain VC-377-1B using primers JB11738 and JB11739, and was used to transform EMHY510 harboring pBS4 (H3-K36A). Transformants were selected on YPD + G418 and were screened by colony PCR for the correct integration, generating strain EMHY578. This strain was transformed with pEMH17 harboring histone alleles, and pBS4 was shuffled. Transformants were patched onto YPD + G418, incubated for 2 d at 30°C, replica-plated to SC–His, and further incubated for 2 d at 30°C. A His+ phenotype in this assay reports inappropriate intragenic transcription initiation.  Transcriptional profiling; data acquisition and normalization  RNA was extracted from log phase cultures of JPY12 strains expressing histone H3-K42 mutations using the acid phenol method. Ten micrograms of total RNA of two replicate samples was used to create labeled cRNA cocktails, as outlined in the Affymetrix protocol. Fifteen micrograms each of labeled cRNA was hybridized on the Affymetrix GeneChip Yeast 2.0 arrays. Data analysis was conducted on the chips' CEL file probe signal values at the Affymetrix probe pair level using the statistical technique Robust Multiarray Analysis (Irizarry et al. 2003) with the bioconductor package Affy. Contrast normalization was carried out as described in Bolstad et al. (2003) using the following control probes: “Bacillus subtilis,” “Bacteriophage,” “Escherichia coli,” “synthetic insert,” and other non-S. cerevisiae “control” probes, excluding all Schizosaccharomyces pombe and S. cerevisiae “control” probes on the microarray. Between-condition and between-replicate variations were examined with pairwise MvA plots, where the base 2 log ratios (M) between two samples are plotted against their averaged base 2 log signals (A). An empirical Bayes method with lognormal–normal modeling, as implemented in the bioconductor package EBarrays, was used to estimate the posterior probabilities of the differential expression of genes between the sample conditions (Kendziorski et al. 2003; Newton et al. 2001). The criterion of a posterior probability >0.5 was used to produce the differentially expressed gene list. Bioconductor packages are found at http://www.bioconductor.org, and all computations were performed under the R environment (http://www.r-project.org). The raw data were deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession number GSE13889.  Real-time quantitative PCR  Strains were grown in rich medium supplemented with 0.64 mM adenine and were harvested at log phase. RNA was prepared from these cells and treated with DNase, and 500 ng of this RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Following RNase H digestion, cDNA equivalent to 25 ng of input RNA was added to a real-time PCR reaction using the Applied Biosystems SYBR Green RT–PCR system. Reactions were run in a 96-well plate using the Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT fast real-time PCR system. The CT values for expression of gene of interest were compared with that of an internal ACT1 control. The primers used for ACT1 amplification were JB9639 and JB9640 for YBR040W; JB10085 and JB10086 for YNR062C; JB10091 and JB10092 for YKL221W; JB10112 and JB10113 for MCD1; and JB12292 and JB12293.  Analysis of dynamic MET16 transcription  Overnight cultures of the indicated strains were diluted 1:20 in rich medium and grown to log phase. Cells were pelleted at room temperature, washed once in water, and added to either SC–Met or SC prewarmed medium, a procedure that took up to 4 min. Aliquots of cells were taken at regular intervals, added to equal volume of ice-cold 100% ethanol, and centrifuged immediately at 4°C. Cell pellets were frozen on dry ice. RNA was extracted from cells and the MET16 transcript was analyzed by quantitative RT–PCR as above using primers JB12026 and JB12027. ACT1 served as the internal control.  Immunoblotting  Whole-cell lysates were prepared from 2.5 A600 units of cells for SDS-PAGE using the alkaline lysis method as described previously (Kushnirov 2000). For histone analyses, lysates were resolved on 4%–20% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies against the C terminus of histone H3 (1:1000 dilution) (Abcam, ab1971), and histone H3-K42me-specific (1:500 dilution) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies against rabbit IgGs (Amersham Pharmacia) and chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). Polyclonal anti-H3-K42me antibodies, generated by Upstate Biotechnologies, were raised in rabbits upon exposure to the H3 peptide PPEMH2, 39-HRYKme2PGTVAL-48. Antibodies were affinity-purified from the rabbit serum using PPEMH2 and eluted at pH 1.7. Peptide competition of Western blots was undertaken by incubating the H3-K42me2-specific antibody with 0.5 μg/mL appropriate peptide (PPEMH1, 39-HRYKPGTVAL-48; PPEMH2, 39-HRYKme2PGTVAL-48; PPEMH3, 39-HRYKmePGTVAL-48; and PPEMH4, 39-HRYKme3PGTVAL-48 ) for 1 h at room temperature prior to probing the blot. Analysis of the phosphorylation state of the C terminus of RNAPII was undertaken as described previously (Patturajan et al. 1998).  Histone H3 ChIP  The protocol employed was described previously (Dedon et al. 1991) using the histone H3 C-terminal antibody (Abcam, ab1971). Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantitated using quantitative RT–PCR as outlined in the preceding section. The following primer pairs were used: JB10085 and JB10086 for 3′ YBR040W, JB12360 and JB12361 for 5′ YBR040W, JB12450 and JB12451 for 5′ YBR284, JB10114 and JB10115 for 3′ YBR284, JB12452 and JB12453 for 5′ YNR062C, and JB12454 and JB12455 for 3′ YNR062C.  mRNA length change detection  RNA was extracted from log phase cultures of JPY12 strains expressing histone H3-K42 mutations using the acid phenol method. The analysis of genomic tiling array data was carried out by methods described in Poorey et al. (2010). TAS (Tiling Analysis software version 1.1) was used to analyze the raw array data to generate graph files containing log2 (fold change) or differential signals. Differential signals were calculated using the Hodges-Leman estimator, which is associated with the Wicoxon rank-sum test, over a sliding window of 500 bp for treatment versus control. We applied a 0.3 cutoff to the absolute value of log2 (fold change)—i.e., the differential signal data—to identify differentially expressed segments. By comparing these segments to annotated 5′ and 3′ ends, we identified RNA length changes in mutants relative to control. These changes were categorized as 5′ extensions, 5′ truncations, 3′ truncations, or 5′ extensions. Putative length changes that did not satisfy certain criteria—including minimum overlap with the annotations, minimum length change, and minimum signal difference—were filtered out (Poorey et al. 2010).  GBM is the most common and also the most devastating brain tumor, with a 5-year survival rate below 10%. We present strong evidence that GBM can be subclassified into multiple groups, indistinguishable by histological appearance, but correlating with molecular-genetic factors as well as key clinical variables such as patient age and tumor location. We identified six epigenetic GBM subgroups displaying characteristic global DNA methylation patterns, harboring distinct hotspot mutations, DNA copy-number alterations, and transcriptomic patterns. These findings may guide the identification of innovative subgroup-specific treatments, e.g., targeted epigenetic therapies for H3.3-mutated variants, and improve the design of future clinical trials. Our study enables classification of GBM across the entire age continuum into biologically meaningful subgroups carrying clinical implications.  Introduction Glioblastoma (GBM; World Health Organization [WHO] grade IV), the most common primary brain tumor, carries a universally dismal prognosis in children and adults (Louis et al., 2007). With evidence emerging recently of age-specific molecular and genetic differences, it is now becoming apparent that pediatric GBM is largely biologically distinct from adult GBM. Based on similarities in recurrent genomic aberrations (Bax et al., 2010; McLendon et al., 2008; Paugh et al., 2010; Qu et al., 2010; Schiffman et al., 2010; Zarghooni et al., 2010), it was long thought that pediatric GBMs more closely resembled adult “secondary” GBM, which arise from a preceding lower-grade lesion. However, stepwise transformation from less-malignant gliomas into GBM rarely occurs in children (Broniscer et al., 2007). Furthermore, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, which are found in up to 98% of adult secondary GBM, are very rare in childhood GBM (<10%) ( Antonelli et al., 2010; Balss et al., 2008; De Carli et al., 2009; Paugh et al., 2010; Pollack et al., 2011; Schiffman et al., 2010; Setty et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2009).  We recently identified two recurrent somatic mutations in the H3F3A gene, affecting highly conserved residues of its encoded protein, the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, in one-third of pediatric GBMs ( Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). Mutations in a protein complex comprised of H3.3 and ATRX/DAXX were detected in 45% of cases, and were shown to be associated with TP53 mutations and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). The H3.3 mutations result in amino acid substitutions at K27 or G34—at or near residues targeted by key post-translational modifications that regulate H3.3’s activity in governing gene expression ( Hyland et al., 2011)—and were shown to be linked to distinct transcriptional profiles (Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). Methylation of K27 and K36 is also disrupted by elevated levels of the onco-metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) resulting from gain-of-function mutations in IDH1 ( Chowdhury et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011), which was previously shown to be associated with a distinct Glioma-CpG-Island Methylator Phenotype (G-CIMP) (Noushmehr et al., 2010).  In the present study, we further investigate the heterogeneity of glioblastoma across the entire age spectrum, and elucidate the impact of H3F3A mutations on the GBM epigenome.  Results Integrated Molecular Classification of Glioblastoma  We used an integrative approach based on epigenetic, copy-number, expression, and genetic analyses to investigate the heterogeneity of glioblastoma across all age groups. An overview of all GBM samples subjected to various analyses is given in Figure S1A available online.  We investigated a cohort of GBMs from children (n = 59) and adult patients (n = 77) for genome-wide DNA methylation patterns using the Illumina 450k methylation array, and complemented our data with unpublished profiles of 74 adult GBM samples generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Consortium (McLendon et al., 2008) (Table S1). Consensus clustering using the 8,000 most variant probes across the data set robustly identified six distinct DNA methylation clusters (Figures 1 and S1B). Based on correlations with mutational status, DNA copy-number aberrations, and gene expression signatures, as outlined below, we have labeled these subgroups “IDH,” “K27,” “G34,” “RTK I (PDGFRA),” “Mesenchymal,” and “RTK II (Classic).”  Methylation Profiling Reveals the Existence of Six Epigenetic GBM ... Figure 1.

Each row represents a probe; each column represents a sample. The level of DNA methylation (beta-value) is represented with a color scale as depicted. For each sample (n = 210), patient age, subgroup association, mutational status, and cytogenetic aberrations are indicated. See also Figure S1 and Tables S1 and S2. Figure options A striking finding of this integrated analysis is that H3F3A K27 and G34 mutations were exclusively distributed to the K27 (18/18) and G34 (18/18) clusters, respectively (p < 0.001; Fisher’s exact test) ( Figure 1). The IDH group contained 88% of IDH1-mutated tumors (23/26) (p < 0.001) and displayed concerted, global hypermethylation ( Figures 1, 2A, and 2B), thereby expanding the previously described link between IDH1 mutation and G-CIMP+ tumors to a pediatric setting (Noushmehr et al., 2010). In contrast, tumors in the G34 cluster specifically showed widespread hypomethylation across the whole genome, and especially in nonpromoter regions, when compared with all other subgroups (Figures 2A and 2B). This suggests the existence of a more global version of a CpG hypomethylator phenotype (CHOP), as proposed for a small number of genes in gastric cancer (Kaneda et al., 2002). More detailed mapping of differentially methylated regions revealed that the hypomethylation observed in H3F3A G34-mutated tumors was particularly prominent at chromosome ends ( Figures 2C and 2D), potentially linking subtelomeric demethylation to alternative lengthening of telomeres, which is most frequently observed in this subgroup (Schwartzentruber et al., 2012).

Figure options Of note, all mutations in H3F3A and IDH1 were mutually exclusive (p < 0.001) ( Figure 1). To further test this observation, we extended the targeted sequencing analysis of H3F3A and IDH1 to include 460 GBM samples from patients covering a broad age range ( Figure S1C; Table S2). Even in this expanded series, no co-occurring mutations in H3F3A and IDH1 were detected (p < 0.001), and the age distribution confirmed reported associations of certain mutations with GBM in children (H3F3A K27), adolescent patients (H3F3A G34), and young adult patients (IDH1) ( Khuong-Quang et al., 2012; Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2009) (Figure S1C; Table S2). As we have shown, TP53 mutations largely overlap with H3F3A mutations in pediatric GBM ( Schwartzentruber et al., 2012), similar to the association of TP53 and IDH1 mutations in adults ( Yan et al., 2009). This observation also holds true in our larger cohort, with a high enrichment of TP53 mutations in the G34 (18/18), IDH (22/24), and K27 (13/18) clusters (p < 0.001) ( Figure 1).  Since pediatric GBMs have been shown to display a distinct spectrum of focal copy-number aberrations (CNAs) compared with their adult counterparts (Bax et al., 2010; Paugh et al., 2010; Qu et al., 2010), we integrated DNA methylation clusters with copy-number data derived from the methylation arrays (Figures 1 and S1D). Interestingly, PDGFRA amplification was significantly more common in the RTK I “PDGFRA” cluster than any other subgroup (11/33; p < 0.001), hence our proposed name for this group. The RTK II “Classic” cluster demonstrated a very high frequency of whole chromosome 7 gain (50/56; p < 0.001) and whole chromosome 10 loss (56/56; p < 0.001), as well as frequent homozygous deletion of CDKN2A (35/56; p < 0.001) and amplification of EGFR (39/56; p < 0.001) ( Figures 1 and S1D)—all hallmark CNAs of adult GBM (Louis et al., 2007), as reflected by the complete absence of pediatric patients in this cluster. Overall, tumors from the IDH, K27, and G34 clusters were mostly devoid of the detected CNAs associated with the other GBM subgroups (amplifications of PDGFRA and EGFR, deletion of CDKN2A, chromosome 7 gain, and chromosome 10 loss) ( Figure 1; Table S1), in keeping with a previously reported finding in G-CIMP+ tumors (Noushmehr et al., 2010).  To additionally place the methylation subgroups proposed here into the context of previous GBM classification systems, we used the gene expression signature described by the TCGA to classify 122 of the above tumors with available transcriptome data into one of four gene expression subtypes: Proneural, Neural, Mesenchymal, and Classical (Verhaak et al., 2010) (Figure 1; Table S1). This further confirmed the prototypic nature of tumors in the RTK II “Classic” cluster, which was clearly enriched for “Classical” expression profiles (p < 0.001). The RTK I “PDGFRA” cluster was highly enriched for “Proneural” expression (p = 0.01), further substantiating the previously reported association of PDGFRA amplification with this expression subtype ( Verhaak et al., 2010). As expected, all tumors in the IDH cluster displayed “Proneural” expression patterns. Interestingly, the K27 cluster also showed a clear enrichment of tumors with a “Proneural” signature (p < 0.01), indicating that this expression subtype can be divided into subgroups harboring distinct genomic aberrations based on methylation profiling and targeted gene sequencing. “Mesenchymal” gene expression was mostly restricted to one methylation subgroup (p < 0.001), that showed a much lower incidence of typical GBM-related CNAs, generally fewer copy-number changes, and no characteristic point mutations. We therefore termed this methylation cluster, which displayed the largest similarity with normal brain methylation patterns, “Mesenchymal.” Copy-number aberrations in these samples were, however, observed at a similar amplitude as in other cases, indicating an absence of excess stromal contamination.  Our finding of six GBM methylation clusters is different from a TCGA study using Illumina 27k arrays, which identified three methylation clusters in an adult GBM cohort (Noushmehr et al., 2010). Applying their signature to our data set, however, showed that two clusters (G-CIMP+ and Cluster #3) mapped almost exactly to two of our subgroups (IDH and RTK II “Classic,”, respectively, p < 0.001) (Figure 1). By adding pediatric cases to the study cohort, we demonstrate that TCGA methylation Cluster #2 can be further divided into four biologically distinct subgroups, defined by a clear enrichment for mutations (K27, G34), CNAs (PDGFRA), and/or gene expression signatures (Mesenchymal). The same DNA methylation clusters were apparent when restricting our analyses to the pediatric population, with the exception of the RTK II “Classic” cluster, which is not represented in the pediatric population (Figure S1E). Notably, by analyzing tumors from patients spanning a broad age spectrum, we further observed a clear age-dependent increase in overall DNA methylation levels (Figure S2A), even after adjusting our analysis to exclude tumors with age-related mutations in IDH1 or H3F3A ( Figure S2B).  GBM Subgroups Show Correlations with Clinicopathological Variables  The DNA methylation clusters described here were closely associated with specific age groups, pointing toward the biological diversity of epigenetic GBM subgroups (Figure 1). While the K27 cluster predominantly consisted of childhood patients (median age 10.5 years, range 5–23 years), patients in the G34 cluster were found mostly around the threshold between the adolescent and adult populations (median age 18 years, range 9–42 years), as previously suggested (Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). The RTK I “PDGFRA” cluster also harbored a proportion of pediatric patients (median age 36 years, range 8–74 years), in line with reports of PDGFRA CNAs being more prevalent in childhood high-grade gliomas ( Bax et al., 2010; Paugh et al., 2010; Qu et al., 2010). The Mesenchymal cluster displayed a widespread age distribution (median age 47, range 2–85 years). The IDH and RTK II “Classic” clusters were mostly comprised of younger adult (median age 40 years, range 13–71 years) and older adult (median age 58, range 36–81 years) patients, respectively, reflecting the established differences in patient age between IDH1-mutated/G-CIMP+ and IDH1 WT adult GBM ( Noushmehr et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2009).  The epigenetic GBM subgroups identified here also showed mutation-specific patterns of tumor location in the central nervous system (Figure 3A). While K27-mutated tumors were predominantly seen in midline locations, e.g., thalamus, pons, and the spinal cord (21/25 cases with available data), tumors from all other subgroups almost exclusively arose in the cerebral hemispheres (86/92, p < 0.001). To further investigate this association of mutation type and location, we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of H3F3A-mutated samples (n = 13). Gene signatures characteristic for K27 and G34 mutant GBMs were applied to a published series of 1,340 transcriptomic profiles representing multiple regions of the developing and adult human brain ( Kang et al., 2011; Figure S3). The G34 mutant signature appeared to be most strongly expressed in early embryonic regions and early- to mid-fetal stages of neocortex and striatum development. In contrast, the K27 signature most closely matched with mid- to late-fetal stages of striatum and thalamus development. Thus, G34 and K27 mutant GBMs seem to show expression patterns of early developmental stages correlating with their subsequent tumor location, possibly indicating different cellular origins and/or time of tumor initiation for these two subgroups.  Epigenetic Subgroups of GBM Correlate with Distinct Clinical Characteristics(A) ... Figure 3.

(B and C) Kaplan-Meier survival curves for GBM subgroups defined by methylation profiling (B), and mutation analysis (C). The p values were computed by log rank tests between subgroups. See also Figure S3. Figure options Correlating our proposed methylation clusters with patient survival indicated differences between mutation-defined subgroups, but this was somewhat restricted by the low number of patients with available survival data in each subgroup (Figure 3B). We therefore enlarged our survival analysis to include all tumors with known H3F3A and IDH1 mutation status ( Figure 3C). As expected, patients with IDH1 mutant tumors had a significantly longer overall survival (OS) than patients with H3F3A and IDH1 WT tumors (p < 0.001) ( Noushmehr et al., 2010; Parsons et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2009). Notably, G34 mutant GBM patients also showed a trend toward a better OS than WT tumor patients, with marginal statistical significance (p = 0.05). In contrast, patients with K27 mutations tended toward an even shorter OS than patients with WT tumors, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.12). Comparing the two H3F3A mutations, patients harboring G34-mutated tumors clearly had a longer OS than patients with tumors carrying the K27 mutation (p < 0.01). While this association may be partly linked to G34-mutated tumors being more accessible to surgery than the midline K27-mutated tumors, the better prognosis of G34 versus K27 was independent of location for those cases where both mutation type and tumor site information were available (p = 0.02; HR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.05–0.77; Cox proportional hazards model).  Integrating Methylome and Transcriptome Data Identifies Marker Genes of GBM Subgroups  A combined analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression data was used to identify subgroup-specific differentially regulated genes (Figures 4A–4C and S4A–4C; Table S3). This analysis revealed Oligodendrocyte Lineage Genes 1 and 2 (OLIG1 and OLIG2) and the neural development gene FOXG1 as top candidates for further analysis in H3F3A-mutated GBMs ( Figure 4A–4C). DNA hypermethylation across the OLIG1 and OLIG2 loci occurred exclusively in G34-mutated tumors, which concurrently displayed significantly lower OLIG1 and OLIG2 gene expression ( Figure 4D–4F). Interestingly, this pattern closely mimics that of embryonic stem cells, where epigenetic inactivation of OLIG1 and OLIG2 has been proposed as a mechanism to prevent neural lineage commitment (Meissner et al., 2008). Expression of FOXG1 was significantly lower in K27-mutated tumors than in all other subgroups, accompanied by higher levels of promoter methylation ( Figures S4A, S4D, and S4E). This comparative analysis also further supported our suggestion of a CHOP-like phenotype in G34 tumors, as most of the differentially methylated genes were found to be hypomethylated (1653/1946, 85%, Figure S4B) in this subgroup, in contrast to the hypermethylator G-CIMP pattern observed in the IDH subgroup (Figure S4C). Hypermethylation and concurrent downregulation of TP73 antisense RNA 1 (TP73-AS1) was identified as a unique characteristic of this IDH/G-CIMP+ cluster (Figures S4D and S4F). Interestingly, inactivation of this gene by promoter methylation has been reported as a common mechanism in a high proportion of oligodendrogliomas, 80% of which are also known to harbor IDH1 mutations ( Pang et al., 2010).

See also Figure S4 and Table S3. Figure options Immunohistochemical Analysis Correctly Subclassifies Mutation-Defined GBM Subgroups  In an attempt to subgroup GBM samples based on differential protein expression—a method which is likely to be more suitable for possible clinical application—we used commercially available antibodies against OLIG2, FOXG1, and mutated IDH1 (R132H) to stain a tissue-microarray (TMA) with cores from 143 pediatric GBMs, and classified tumors according to their protein expression patterns (Figures 5A and 5B; Table S4). The resulting fractions of tumors with predicted mutations in IDH1 (IDH1R132H, n = 6) and H3F3A (OLIG2+/FOXG1− for K27, n = 37, and OLIG2−/FOXG1+ for G34, n = 21) were consistent with the frequency of each mutation in the pediatric population as detected by targeted gene sequencing (Figure S1C). Our approach correctly classified GBMs with known H3F3A and IDH1 mutation status, and revealed a frequent association between OLIG2−/FOXG1+ tumors (assumed to be G34-mutated), loss of ATRX protein expression, and an ALT phenotype (Figures 5B–D), as previously reported for H3F3A G34-mutated tumors ( Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). The putative H3F3A mutant groups also did not overlap with tumors harboring IDH1 (R132H) mutations, and only one case with EGFR amplification and homozygous CDKN2A deletion was detected therein ( Figure S5A). The correlation with clinicopathological variables, such as tumor location and patient survival, also reflected our findings from the array-based analysis (Figures S5B and S5C). Of note, rare tumors represented on the TMA occurring in the basal ganglia and the spinal cord were almost always found in the OLIG2+/FOXG1− subgroup (and therefore predicted to harbor the H3F3A K27 mutation), further strengthening our hypothesis of the H3F3A K27 mutation as a unifying characteristic of midline GBM.  Identification of H3F3A-Mutated GBMs by Differential Protein Expression ... Figure 5.

Figure options Discussion We have identified six biological subgroups of GBM based on global DNA methylation patterns, which correlate with specific molecular-genetic alterations and key clinical parameters. Our findings suggest that at least 30%–40% of pediatric/young adult GBMs are likely characterized by disrupted epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, associated with recurrent and mutually exclusive mutations in either H3F3A or IDH1, and aberrant DNA methylation patterns. Placing these subgroups into the context of previous molecular GBM classification schemes described by the TCGA ( Noushmehr et al., 2010; Verhaak et al., 2010) revealed a clear correlation with DNA methylation clusters and a corresponding enrichment for previously established expression signatures in different epigenetic subgroups. We have also demonstrated that our proposed classification can refine that described by the TCGA for adult GBM, to give a stratification system that is applicable across all ages, and defines additional biologically meaningful subgroups. A simplified graphical summary of the key molecular and biological characteristics of the GBM subgroups as identified by our integrated classification strategy is given in Figure 6.  Graphical Summary of Key Molecular and Biological Characteristics of GBM ... Figure 6.  Graphical Summary of Key Molecular and Biological Characteristics of GBM Subgroups Simplified schematic representation of key genetic and epigenetic findings in six GBM subgroups as identified by methylation profiling and correlations with clinical patient data. Figure options We and others have recently described a high frequency of H3F3A K27 mutations in thalamic GBMs and in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), suggesting that the latter likely represent an anatomically-defined subset of K27 mutant GBM ( Khuong-Quang et al., 2012; Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012). We now extend this observation to a larger subgroup of GBM, characterized by the K27M mutation, which almost exclusively occurs in midline locations, including rare tumors in the basal ganglia and the spinal cord. This is in line with a recent study by Puget et al. (2012) in which gene expression patterns of brainstem gliomas were found to resemble midline/thalamic tumors, indicating a closely related origin. The K27 subgroup also displays markedly lower expression of the ventral telencephalic marker FOXG1 than other subgroups. Conversely, non-K27 tumors were restricted to hemispheric locations, further underlining the biological divergence of epigenetic GBM subgroups. While recurrent focal amplification of PDGFRA has been suggested as a key oncogenic event in pediatric DIPGs in some studies ( Paugh et al., 2011; Puget et al., 2012; Zarghooni et al., 2010), midline-associated tumors in the K27 or OLIG2+/FOXG1− subgroups (including ten brainstem gliomas with known PDGFRA copy-number status) lacked this common feature in our series. PDGFRA amplification was, however, enriched in a subgroup of supratentorial hemispheric GBMs. In part, this discrepancy may be explained by the use of autopsy (and therefore post radio/chemotherapy) material in previous study cohorts of DIPGs, which might have been confounded by the higher incidence of PDGFRA amplifications observed in radiation-induced gliomas ( Paugh et al., 2010). Nevertheless, amplifications of PDGFRA have also been detected in small numbers of pretreatment samples ( Paugh et al., 2011; Puget et al., 2012; Zarghooni et al., 2010), and post-treatment samples were not found to show increased widespread genomic instability (Paugh et al., 2011). This particularly clinically challenging subset of tumors clearly warrants further investigation, underlining the importance of routine stereotactic biopsy of DIPGs at the time of primary diagnosis.  OLIG2 has previously been reported as a universal marker for diffuse gliomas (Ligon et al., 2004), and OLIG2-positive progenitor-like cells of the subventricular zone have been suggested as potential glioma-initiating cells (Wang et al., 2009). There is also evidence that OLIG2-mediated modification of p53 function is required for complete inactivation of the latter in malignant gliomas, which typically show indirect loss of p53 activity through MDM2 amplification or p14ARF deletion (Mehta et al., 2011). Here, we describe a distinct subgroup of GBM, harboring the H3F3A G34 mutation, in which OLIG1 and OLIG2 protein expression is absent. Given the ∼100% mutation frequency of TP53 in this subgroup, this may indicate a different pathogenesis of G34-mutated GBM, in which direct inactivation of p53 is required rather than via an OLIG2-dependent mechanism.  The previously reported association of H3F3A mutations, particular the G34 mutation, with loss of ATRX and ALT ( Schwartzentruber et al., 2012) is further expanded upon here. Interestingly, the global CHOP that we observed in G34 mutants was particularly pronounced in subtelomeric regions, suggesting a possible mechanistic link with ALT in these tumors (Gonzalo et al., 2006). Whether this is a more general phenotype that can be observed in clinically and etiologically distinct subgroups of other human cancers, remains to be investigated.  The close link between H3F3A mutation type, tumor location, and differential expression of key neuronal lineage markers leads us to speculate that there may be differences in the cell of origin and/or the time of tumor development between these GBM subgroups. Although supported by the differential expression of mutant-specific gene signatures at different stages of human brain development, this remains to be formally shown. Also requiring further validation in larger, prospective cohorts is the association of the G34 mutation with better overall survival compared with H3F3A and IDH1 WT tumors, and that of K27 mutation with potentially poorer prognosis, as observed in our series and a recent cohort of pediatric DIPGs ( Khuong-Quang et al., 2012).  Given the location of the H3F3A mutations at or near critical regulatory histone residues, and their distinct methylation profiles, we consider it likely that the H3.3 mutations are directly involved in producing widespread aberrant DNA methylation and deregulation of gene expression. This has recently been shown for IDH1 mutations, which alone are sufficient to induce the global epigenetic reprogramming of the G-CIMP phenotype in normal astrocytes ( Turcan et al., 2012). Overproduction of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate in IDH1-mutated cells inhibits the TET family of 5-methlycytosine hydroxylases and H3K27-specific demethylases. This is thought to lead to decreased 5-hydroxylmethycytosine and increased H3K27 methylation ( Xu et al., 2011), resulting in aberrant DNA and histone methylation, and a block to differentiation (Christensen et al., 2011; Dang et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2012).  Seminal studies have shown that DNA methylation patterns are tightly linked to histone 3 lysine K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) patterns (Brinkman et al., 2012; Statham et al., 2012), and in high-CpG-density promoters, loss of H3K4me3 and retention of H3K4me2 or H3K27me3 is correlated with an increase in DNA methylation (Meissner et al., 2008). Therefore, mutations affecting H3K27 methylation are likely to affect DNA methylation. In addition, mutations in ATRX have been shown to give rise to changes in the patterns of DNA methylation of several highly repeated sequences, which further supports the link between chromatin remodeling machinery and DNA methylation (Gibbons et al., 2000). Based on our current knowledge, the incorporation of H3.3 variants into the genome, and the subsequent effects on gene regulation, involve the H3.3 chaperone complex (including ATRX and DAXX) in a replication independent manner (Drané et al., 2010; Goldberg et al., 2010) but other factors also likely play a role. The exact mechanism by which the H3F3A mutations might be inducing epigenetic reprogramming requires further elucidation.  In conclusion, this study describes a number of findings that enhance our understanding of the heterogeneity of GBM, as well as shedding light on potential cellular origins and oncogenic pathways leading to gliomagenesis. We have identified potential prognostic biomarkers, which may be further exploited for molecular diagnostic purposes, and also provided a focus for future work at a basic and translational/targeted therapeutic level, particularly in a pediatric and young adult setting.  Experimental Procedures Patients and Tumor Samples  Primary tumor samples for methylation (n = 136; Table S1), mutation (n = 460; Table S2), and gene expression (n = 69) analysis and all clinical data were collected at the DKFZ (Heidelberg, Germany) and at McGill University (Montreal, Canada). Paraffin-embedded samples (n = 143; Table S4) for TMA analysis were collected from the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute (Moscow, Russia) and from the Department of Neuropathology, University of Würzburg (Germany). Patient clinical details can be found in Table S1 for the methylation analysis data set and in Table S4 for the TMA cohort. All of the tumors were banked at the time of primary diagnosis between 1994 and 2011 in accordance with research ethics board approval from the respective institutes. Informed consent was obtained from all patients included in this study. An overview of all samples included in different data collections is given in Figure S1A. All of the samples were independently reviewed by senior pediatric neuropathologists (S.A. and A.K.) according to the WHO guidelines. Detailed information about samples provided by TCGA can be found elsewhere (http://cancergenome.nih.gov).  DNA Methylation Profiling  For genome-wide assessment of DNA methylation GBM samples (n = 136) and controls (n = 10; four fetal and two adult samples of non-neoplastic cerebellum; two samples of Whole-Genome Amplified DNA (unmethylated control; two samples of M.SssI-treated DNA [100% methylated control]) were arrayed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip according to the manufacturer’s instructions at the DKFZ. Methylation data of additional adult glioblastoma samples (n = 74) were obtained from the TCGA website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov; available data from TCGA batches 79 and 111).  The following filtering criteria were applied: Removal of probes targeting the X and Y chromosomes (n = 11,551), removal of probes containing a single-nucleotide polymorphism (dbSNP132 Common) within five base pairs of and including the targeted CpG-site (n = 24,536), and probes not mapping uniquely to the human reference genome (hg19) allowing for one mismatch (n = 9,993). In total, 438,370 probes were kept for analysis.  For a subset of differentially methylated genes from the 450k array, MassARRAY technology (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to validate our results, allowing us to compare DNA methylation levels at 29 individual CpG-sites investigated by both techniques. DNA methylation measurements of those 29 CpG dinucleotides were highly correlated (median Pearson’s correlation: r = 0.96; range: 0.71–1.00).  Gene Expression Profiling  Glioblastoma samples for which RNA of sufficient quantity and quality was available (n = 69) were analyzed on the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array at the Microarray Department of the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Sample library preparation, hybridization, and quality control were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Expression data were normalized using the MAS5.0 algorithm of the GCOS program (Affymetrix Inc). Gene expression data of additional adult glioblastoma samples (n = 74) were obtained from the TCGA website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov; available data from TCGA batches 79 and 111). Predictive analysis of microarrays was used to assign TCGA methylation and gene expression subgroups to each of the samples in the present study.  Detection of CNAs  Copy-number aberrations were detected from the 450k Infinium methylation array in a custom approach using the sum of both methylated and unmethylated signals (Figure S1D). For the detection of EGFR and PDGFRA high-level amplifications, homozygous CDKN2A deletions, and CNAs affecting chromosomes 7 and 10 (as depicted in Figure 1), automatic scoring was verified by manual curation of the respective loci for each individual profile, and compared with results obtained from SNP profiling and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis where available. The three methodologies showed very high concordance.  Statistical Analysis and Measurement of Differential DNA Methylation and Gene Expression  For unsupervised consensus clustering we used the 8,000 most variable methylated probes (by standard deviation) across the data set (R package: clusterCons) (Monti et al., 2003; Wilkerson and Hayes, 2010). The consensus matrix was calculated using the k-means algorithm (10 random starting sets, maximum of 1,000 iterations) on a fraction of probes (0.8) in 1,000 iterations. The significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method was used to identify genes that are differentially methylated or differentially expressed between subgroups. Correction for multiple testing was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Genes were considered significantly differentially methylated/expressed between two subgroups when displaying an adjusted p value < 0.01 and a methylation difference of 0.2 or a 2-fold change in expression.  Statistical Analysis of Clinical and Molecular Data  Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate the survival time of different GBM subgroups and a log rank test was used to test for differences of more than one survival curve. Comparisons of binary and categorical patient characteristics between subgroups were performed by the use of a two-sided Fisher’s exact test. An unpaired t test was used to test for differences between the mean values for continuous variables in GBM subgroups.  Immunohistochemistry and FISH  Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections from all 143 paraffin blocks were prepared to define representative tumor regions for inclusion in the TMA. Antibodies against the following antigens were applied: OLIG2 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; AB9610; dilution 1:250), FOXG1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab18259; dilution 1:50), ATRX (Sigma, HPA001906; dilution 1:750), and mutated IDH1 (R132H; (Capper et al., 2010; dianova, DIA H09). Multicolor interphase FISH analysis for PDGFRA, EGFR, and CDKN2A was performed as described ( Pfister et al., 2009). Telomere-specific FISH was done using a standard formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FISH protocol (Heaphy et al., 2011) using a FITC peptide nucleic acid telomere probe from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark).  Genomic Sequencing  Targeted sequencing of H3F3A (first coding exon), IDH1 (exon 4), and TP53 (all exons) was performed by QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany) in both forward and reverse directions using purified PCR products. PCR procedures were as previously described ( Pfaff et al., 2010). Primer sequences are available upon request. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children. However, DNA copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases1, 2, 3, 4. To explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric GBM samples. Somatic mutations in the H3.3-ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). Recurrent mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. Mutations in ATRX (α-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked)5 and DAXX (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for H3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres6, 7, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation. Somatic TP53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with H3F3A and/or ATRX mutations. Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to GBM and highly prevalent in children and young adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. This is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult GBM pathogenesis.

Figure 3 right Main Main• Methods• References• Acknowledgements• Author information• Supplementary information Brain tumours are currently the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity in children. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumour and the first cancer to be comprehensively profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium. Whereas GBM is less common in the paediatric setting than in adults, affected children show dismal outcomes similar to adult patients, and the vast majority will die within a few years of diagnosis despite aggressive therapeutic approaches. Tumours arise de novo (primary GBM) and are morphologically indistinguishable from their adult counterparts. A number of comprehensive studies have identified transcriptome-based subgroups and indicator mutations in adult GBM, and have thus enabled its molecular sub-classification8, 9, 10, 11. In contrast, although we and others have demonstrated the presence of distinct molecular subsets of childhood GBM and described different genetic alterations compared to adult cases, the paediatric disease remains understudied1, 2, 3, 4, 12. There is currently insufficient information to improve disease management, and because conventional treatments universally fail, there is a crucial need to identify relevant targets for the design of new therapeutic agents.  To decipher the molecular pathogenesis of paediatric GBM, we undertook a comprehensive mutation analysis in protein-coding genes by performing whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 48 well-characterized paediatric GBMs, including 6 patients for whom we had matched non-tumour (germline) DNA. Samples from the tumour core containing more than 90% neoplastic tissue were collected from patients aged between 3 and 20 years (Supplementary Table 1). Coding regions of the genome were enriched by capture with the Illumina TruSeq kit and sequenced with 100-base-pairs paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Supplementary Methods). The median coverage of each base in the targeted regions was 61-fold, and 91% of the bases were represented by at least 10 reads (Supplementary Table 2). We identified 87 somatic mutations in 80 genes among the 6 tumours for which we had matched constitutive DNA. The mutation count per tumour ranged from 3 to 31, with a mean of 15 (Supplementary Table 3). This is much lower than the rate observed using Sanger sequencing in other solid tumours including adult GBM11, but somewhat higher than in another paediatric brain tumour, medulloblastoma13 (Supplementary Table 4). Relevant mutations (as defined below) were validated by Sanger sequencing.  Initially, we focused on the distribution of somatic, non-silent protein-coding mutations in the six tumours with matched germline DNA. Four samples had recurrent heterozygous mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone variant H3.3. Both mutations were single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), in two samples changing lysine 27 to methionine (K27M), and in two samples changing glycine 34 to arginine (G34R) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 3). These mutations are particularly interesting because histone genes are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes (Fig. 1b), and to our knowledge no human disorders have specifically been associated with mutations in histones, including H3.3. Both mutations are at or very near positions in the amino-terminal tail of the protein that undergo important post-translational modifications associated with either transcriptional repression (K27) or activation (K36) (Fig. 1b). All four samples additionally harboured mutations in ATRX, which encodes a member of a transcription/chromatin remodelling complex required for the incorporation of H3.3 at pericentric heterochromatin and at telomeres, as well as at several transcription factor binding sites7, 14, 15, 16, 17. We extended our WES analysis to 42 additional tumour samples and focused on ATRX and H3F3A, as well as DAXX (because the gene product heterodimerizes with ATRX and participates in H3.3 recruitment to DNA6, 7). A total of 15 samples had heterozygous H3.3 mutations (9 K27M, 5 G34R, 1 G34V) and 14 samples had a mutation in ATRX, including frameshift insertions/deletions (6 samples), gains of a stop codon (4 samples), and missense SNVs (4 samples). Nearly all of the ATRX mutations occurred either within the carboxy-terminal helicase domain or led to truncation of the protein upstream of this domain (Fig. 1c). Mutations were accompanied by an absence of detectable ATRX protein by immunohistochemistry in samples for which paraffin material was available (Supplementary Fig. 1). Two samples had heterozygous DAXX mutations, simultaneously with an ATRX mutation in one sample (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 3). Overall, 21 of 48 samples (44%) had a mutation in at least one of these three genes. Notably, we also identified TP53 mutations in 26 samples (25 somatic, 1 germline in PGBM26), which overlapped significantly with samples that had ATRX, DAXX and/or H3F3A mutations (18/21 cases, 86%, Fig. 1d; P = 1.1 × 10−4, permutation test). A list of all mutations discovered by WES in selected genes associated with GBM is given in Supplementary Table 5.  Figure 1: Most frequent mutations in paediatric GBM. Most frequent mutations in paediatric GBM. a, Most frequent somatic mutations in 48 paediatric glioblastoma tumours. Mutations identified in genes listed in this table were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and were not present in dbSNP nor in the 1000 Genomes data set (October 2011), except for the TP53 SNP at R273, which is associated with cancer. Detailed description of the mutations in affected samples is provided in Supplementary Table 5. b, Three recurrent non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were observed in H3F3A. The K27M, G34R and G34V mutations are shown in the context of the common post-translational modifications of the H3.3 N-terminal tail, which regulates the histone code. H3.3 has 136 amino acids, and is highly conserved across species from mammals to plants, including the residues subject to mutation in paediatric GBM (see multiple alignment of amino acids 11 to 60). c, Schematic of the mutations observed in ATRX in the 48 WES samples. d, Schematic of the overlap between mutations affecting ATRX-DAXX, H3F3A and TP53.

To investigate whether H3F3A mutations are specific to GBM and/or paediatric disease, we sequenced this gene in 784 glioma samples from all grades and histological diagnoses across the entire age range (Fig. 2a). H3.3 mutations were highly specific to GBM and were much more prevalent in the paediatric setting (32/90, 36%), although they also occurred rarely in young adults with GBM (11/318, 3%) (Fig. 2b). K27M-H3.3 mutations occurred mainly in younger patients (median age 11 years, range 5–29) and thalamic GBM (Supplementary Table 1), whereas G34R- or G34V-H3.3 mutations occurred in older patients (median age 20 years, range 9–42) and in tumours of the cerebral hemispheres (Fig. 2b). Further comparison of our data set with adult GBM databases8, 10, 11, 18, 19 indicated limited overlap in frequently mutated genes between paediatric GBM and any of the four previously described adult GBM subtypes18 (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 6).

K27M-H3.3 mutations occur mainly in younger patients (median age 11 years) and G34R/V-H3.3 mutations occur in older children and young adults (median age 20 years). No H3.3 mutations were identified in older patients with GBM. c, Comparison of the most frequently mutated genes in paediatric and adult GBM shows that H3F3A, ATRX and DAXX mutations are largely specific to paediatric disease. Except for similarities in the mutation rate for TP53 and PDGFRA with the previously identified proneural adult GBM subgroup, the rate and type of genes mutated were distinct between paediatric and adult GBM whatever the molecular subgroup27 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Data for adult GBM regarding other genes included in the table was compiled from refs 11 and 18. d, ATRX and DAXX immunohistochemical staining of a paediatric GBM tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 124 samples. View of the TMA slide and an example of a negative and of a positive core at high magnification to show specific nuclear staining (or lack thereof) for DAXX and ATRX. No gender bias for ATRX loss was observed.

A follow-up study found ATRX mutations in a series of cancers, including GBM, where ATRX (but not DAXX) mutations were identified in 3/21 paediatric GBMs (14%) and 8/122 adult GBMs (7%)20. To evaluate further the prevalence of ATRX and DAXX mutations in paediatric GBM, we performed immunostaining for these proteins on a well-characterized tissue microarray (TMA) with samples from 124 paediatric GBM patients. Lack of immunopositivity for ATRX was seen in 35% of cases (40/113 scored, 22 females and 18 males) and for DAXX in 6% (7/124 scored) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall, 37% of samples had lost nuclear expression of either factor, corroborating our WES findings. Strikingly, ATRX-DAXX mutations (as assessed by direct sequencing or loss of protein expression) were found in 100% of G34-H3.3 mutant cases in the larger cohort of GBMs (13/13) where sufficient material was available (P = 1.4 × 10−8, permutation test). The overlap of ATRX mutations with K27M-H3.3-mutated samples was not significant in either the exome data set (3/9 samples, P = 0.58) or the full set of GBM screened (5/13, P = 0.40) (Fig. 2e).  The histone code—post-translational modifications of specific histone residues—regulates virtually all processes that act on or depend on DNA, including replication and repair, regulation of gene expression, and maintenance of centromeres and telomeres21. Accordingly, although recurrent histone mutations have not previously been reported in cancer, mutations in genes affecting histone post-translational modifications are increasingly described22. H3.3 is a universal, replication-independent histone predominantly incorporated into transcription sites and telomeric regions, and associated with active and open chromatin (reviewed in ref. 23). This role is conserved in the single histone H3 present in yeast, indicating its importance throughout evolution. It functions as a neutral replacement histone, but also participates in the epigenetic transmission of active chromatin states and is associated with chromatin assembly factors in large-scale replication-independent chromatin remodelling events23.  The non-random recurrence of the exact same mutation in different tumours, and the absence of truncating mutations, indicate that H3F3A mutations are most probably gain-of-function events. Lysine 27 is a critical residue of histone 3 and its variants, and methylation at this position (H3K27me), which may be mimicked by the terminal CH3 of methionine substituted at this residue, is commonly associated with transcriptional repression24. In contrast, H3K36 methylation or acetylation typically promotes gene transcription25, 26. Thus, although their morphological phenotype is very similar (K27M and G34R/V mutant tumours are histologically indistinguishable), the two H3.3 variants are expected to act through a different set of genes. This indeed seems to be the case when looking at expression profiles of GBMs harbouring these two mutations. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression from 27 of the WES cohort samples for which sufficient RNA was available revealed a clear separation in the expression of K27M versus G34R/V mutant samples (Supplementary Fig. 3). Further analysis of just those samples harbouring an H3F3A mutation additionally showed a clear distinction in the expression pattern of these two variants (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 7). Among these differentially expressed genes were several linked to brain development that showed a clear mutation-specific expression pattern when comparing both between K27 and G34 mutants and with H3.3 wild-type GBMs, including DLX2, SFRP2, FZD7 and MYT1 (Fig. 3b). We also identified increased levels of H3K36 trimethylation in cells carrying the G34V-H3.3 mutation in one sample for which we had available material (PGBM14) compared to other cells, potentially supporting this hypothesis (Supplementary Fig. 5).  Figure 3: H3F3A mutation variants show distinct expression profiles and are associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres. H3F3A mutation variants show distinct expression profiles and are associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres. a, Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes in 27 of the 48 GBM samples analysed by whole-exome sequencing shows that samples with K27M and G34R/V H3.3 have specific gene expression profiles. Clustering was based on the top 100 genes by standard deviation from autosomal genes detected as present in >10% of samples (see also Supplementary Fig. 3). b, Genes involved in development and differentiation show H3.3 mutation-specific expression patterns. Expression levels of developmental-related genes including DLX2, SFRP2, FZD7 and MYT1 are distinct among H3.3-K27 mutant and H3.3-G34 mutants following gene expression profiling (see also Supplementary Table 7). c, Alternate lengthening of telomere (ALT) is associated with the presence of mutant H3F3A/ATRX in a tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 124 paediatric GBM samples. We assessed ALT using telomere-specific FISH (shown here and in Supplementary Fig. 4) on the paediatric TMA we investigated for ATRX expression (Fig. 2d) and using telomere-specific Southern blotting of high molecular weight genomic DNA (data not shown). Fisher’s exact test was used to identify any association relationship. Representative images of ALT-positive and -negative staining of a paediatric GBM tissue microarray and a control brain are provided.  Full size image (120 KB) Download PowerPoint slide (243K) Previous Figures index ATRX loss, frequently observed in this study, has recently been shown to be associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) in PanNETs and GBMs20. We performed telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on the samples with K27M or G34R/V mutations identified by WES for which we had slides available (Supplementary Fig. 4) and on the paediatric GBM TMA (Fig. 3c). These experiments showed that ALT is strongly correlated with ATRX loss (37/47 samples with ALT showed ATRX loss, P < 0.001). However, some samples with nuclear ATRX staining still showed ALT, indicating that additional defects may also account for elongated telomeres in GBM. The presence of ALT was best explained by the simultaneous presence of ATRX/H3F3A/TP53 mutations (P = 0.0002, Fisher’s exact test). Tumours without ATRX/H3F3A/TP53 mutations almost invariably showed shorter telomeres than are observed with ALT, as seen in telomerase-positive gliomas27.  Genetic stability was also assessed through evaluating DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 31 of the 48 tumours using Illumina SNP arrays containing ~2.5 million oligonucleotides (Supplementary Tables 1, 8, 9). Loss of heterozygosity (whole chromosome changes, broad and focal heterozygous deletions, Supplementary Table 9) was common in paediatric GBM samples, as we have previously reported4, and the focal gains and losses we identified in our study showed a high degree of overlap with other published paediatric data sets3, 21. The number of CNAs per tumour was higher in samples with H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 6).  Recurrent point mutations in IDH1 (mainly R132H) are gain of function mutations commonly identified in secondary GBM and the lower-grade tumours from which they develop (86–98% of these astrocytomas), and typically occur in younger adults11, 28. Strikingly, IDH1 and H3F3A mutations were mutually exclusive in our sequencing cohort (P = 1.6 × 10−4). Neomorphic enzyme activity resulting from IDH1 mutation leads to the production of high quantities of the onco-metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG)29. Increased 2-HG inhibits histone demethylases, specifically inducing increased methylation of both H3K27 and H3K3629, 30, the two residues affected directly (K27) or indirectly (K36) by the mutations in H3F3A uncovered in this study. Furthermore, overlap of H3F3A and TP53 mutations in children with GBM (all of the G34R/V and 82% of K27M mutants also harbour TP53 mutations) mirrors the large overlap of IDH1 mutations with TP53 mutations in the proneural adult GBM sub-group18. Thus, mutations which directly (H3F3A), or indirectly (IDH1) affect the methylation of H3.3 K27 or H3.3 K36, in combination with TP53 mutations, characterize the pathogenesis of paediatric and young adult GBM.  Our data indicate a central role of H3.3/ATRX-DAXX perturbation in paediatric GBM. Mutant H3.3 recruitment would occur across the genome and induce abnormal patterns of chromatin remodelling to yield distinct gene expression profiles for the K27 and G34 mutations. Additional loss of ATRX may act to reduce H3.3 incorporation at a subset of genes important in oncogenesis, preventing mutant H3.3 from altering their transcription. ATRX loss will also impair H3.3 loading at telomeres and disrupt their heterochromatic state, facilitating alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Our findings provide an intriguing example of the interplay of genetic and epigenetic events in driving cancer, indicate a new mechanism through which these epigenetic alterations are brought about (mutation of key residues in a regulatory histone), and provide a rationale for targeting the chromatin remodelling machinery in this deadly paediatric cancer.  Methods Main• Methods• References• Acknowledgements• Author information• Supplementary information Sample characteristics and pathological review All samples were obtained with informed consent after approval of the Institutional Review Board of the respective hospitals they were treated in and were independently reviewed by senior paediatric neuropathologists (S.A., A.K.) according to the WHO guidelines. Forty-eight paediatric grade IV astrocytomas (glioblastoma GBM) patients between the age of 3 and 20 years were included in the study. Clinical characteristics of patients are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Samples were taken at the time of the first surgery, before further treatment as needed. Tissues were obtained from the London/Ontario Tumour Bank of the Pediatric Cooperative Health Tissue Network, the Montreal Children’s Hospital and from collaborators in Hungary and Germany. Seven hundred and eighty-four glioma samples from all grades and histological diagnoses across the entire age range in this study were obtained from collaborators across Europe and North America.  Alignment and variant calling for whole-exome sequencing We followed standard manufacturer protocols to perform target capture with the Illumina TruSeq exome enrichment kit and sequencing of 100 bp paired end reads on Illumina HiSeq. We generated approximately 10 Gb of sequence for each subject such that >90% of the coding bases of the exome defined by the consensus coding sequence (CCDS) project were covered by at least 10 reads. We removed adaptor sequences and quality trimmed reads using the Fastx toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) and then used a custom script to ensure that only read pairs with both mates present were subsequently used. Reads were aligned to hg19 with BWA31, and duplicate reads were marked using Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) and excluded from downstream analyses. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions and deletions (indels) were called using samtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) pileup and varFilter32 with the base alignment quality (BAQ) adjustment disabled, and were then quality filtered to require at least 20% of reads supporting the variant call. Variants were annotated using both ANNOVAR33 and custom scripts to identify whether they affected protein coding sequence, and whether they had previously been seen in dbSNP131, the 1000 Genomes data set (October 2011), or in approximately 160 exomes previously sequenced at our centre.  Somatic mutation identification for whole-exome sequencing A variant called in a tumour was considered to be a candidate somatic mutation if the matched normal sample had at least 10 reads covering this position and had zero variant reads, and the variant was not reported in dbSNP131 or the 1000 Genomes data set (October 2011). For the resulting 117 candidate somatic mutations, we manually examined the alignment of each to check for sequencing artefacts and alignment errors. Fifteen variants were easily identified as sequence-specific error artefacts commonly seen shortly downstream of GGC sequences on Illumina sequencers34. Once genes of interest were identified (H3F3A, ATRX, DAXX, TP53, NF1), we examined positions in these genes in the 34 tumour samples where less than 20% of the reads supported the variant. This identified only two additional variants, both in sample PGBM19 where there were low read counts for frameshift insertions in both ATRX (6/32 reads) and DAXX (8/47 reads).  Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of paediatric GBM and TMA (4 µm) were immunohistochemically stained for ATRX and DAXX proteins. Unstained sections were subjected to antigen retrieval in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min at sub-boiling temperatures. Individual slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-ATRX (1:750 dilution, Sigma, catalogue no. HPA001906) or rabbit anti-DAXX (1:100 dilution, Sigma, catalogue no. HPA008736) antibodies. After incubation with the primary antibody, secondary biotin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson) were applied for 30 min. After washing with PBS, slides were developed with diaminobenzidine (Dako) as the chromogen. All slides were counterstained using Harris haematoxylin. The criterion for positive staining was described previously20. Immunohistochemistry staining on TMA was scored by three individuals independently, including a pathologist. To test the level of mono-, di- and trimethylated H3 at position K36, cell lysates from tumour cells were analysed by western blot. Antibodies against H3K36me3 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab9050), H3K36me2 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab9049), H3K36me1 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab9048) and H3.3 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab97968) were used, with conditions suggested by the manufacturer.  Gene expression profiling Total RNA from frozen samples was hybridized to Affymetrix-HG-U133 plus 2.0 gene chips (Affymetrix). Array quality assurance was determined using β-actin and GAPDH 3′/5′ ratio, as recommended by the manufacturer.  Genome-wide SNP array DNA from 31 of the 48 paediatric GBM tumours analysed by whole-exome sequencing was hybridized to Illumina Human Omni 2.5M Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) arrays, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Copy number alterations were analysed using Illumina GenomeStudio Data Analysis Software (Illumina) as previously described35. Statistical analysis of Fisher’s exact test was performed using GraphPad Prism software.  Telomere specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Telomere-specific FISH was done using a standard formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FISH protocol (as described in ref. 20), using a FITC peptide nucleic acid telomere probe from Dako.  
307||The DNA entry and exit points on the nucleosome core regulate the initial invasion of the nucleosome by factors requiring access to the underlying DNA. Here we describe in vivo consequences of eliminating a single protein–DNA interaction at this position through mutagenesis of histone H3 Lys 42 to alanine. This substitution has a dramatic effect on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome in both the transcriptional output and landscape of mRNA species produced. We attribute this in part to decreased histone H3 occupancy at transcriptionally active loci, leading to enhanced elongation. Additionally we show that this lysine is methylated in vivo, and genetic studies of methyl-lysine mimics suggest that this modification may be crucial in attenuating gene expression. Interestingly, this site of methylation is unique to Ascomycota, suggesting a recent evolutionary innovation that highlights the evolvability of post-translational modifications of chromatin.  Keywords: evolution, histone methylation, transcription elongation, transcriptional output, yeast Nucleosomes, the octameric histone protein complex wrapped by 147 base pairs (bp) of DNA, are core components of chromatin in eukaryotes. At a molecular level, the nucleosome crystal structure shows that there are 14 DNA–histone interactions within the core particle, positioned at each minor groove (Luger et al. 1997). Twelve of these interactions are mediated by histone fold motifs of all four histone proteins, and the remaining two involve residues in the histone H3 αN helix at the DNA entry and exit points. Although the majority of these interactions are mediated by nonspecific electrostatics between the DNA and protein backbones, important positively charged histone side chains have also been shown to play a role (Luger and Richmond 1998). Recently, it has been shown in vitro that not all histone–DNA interactions within the nucleosome are of equal strength. Using an optical trapping method, Hall et al. (2009) mapped the strongest interactions to three precise locations on the nucleosome core, including the dyad axis, and ±40 bp on either side of this.  The different classes of intranucleosomal interactions illustrate how the cell can tune the stability of the nucleosome by reinforcing or destabilizing these interactions, thus controlling the timing and extent of accessibility of the underlying DNA. Various proteins and complexes are recruited to chromatin to alter nucleosome stability either temporally or spatially throughout the genome, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, histone variant proteins, and enzymes that chemically modify histone amino acid side chains. (for review, see Hartzog er al. 2002; Li et al. 2007; Clapier and Cairns 2009). The question then arises as to which structurally important interactions defining nucleosome stability at a molecular level are targeted by these processes.  First, it is known that modification of histone residues is quite complex. Modification of residues lying both at the N termini of histone proteins and within the globular core perturbs the formation of higher-order chromatin structure by influencing electrostatic interactions, and through interactions with specific information “readers” (Watanabe et al. 2010). Second, it has been suggested that the residues at the dyad axis are targeted by chromatin remodeling enzymes, because introducing histone mutations in this region (so-called “SIN alleles”) facilitated transcription of genes that typically require chromatin remodeling in the absence of the ATP-dependent factors (Kruger et al. 1995; Recht and Osley 1999) and lead to nucleosome instability in vitro (Kurumizaka and Wolffe 1997). Furthermore, residues at/close to the dyad axis in the nucleosome do not tolerate mutagenesis well, as these positions are overrepresented in collections of lethal histone mutations (Dai et al. 2008; Nakanishi et al. 2008). Third, it has been shown that certain mutations in histone H3 resulted in the formation of spurious transcription from intragenic locations (Cheung et al. 2008), suggesting that the role of the wild-type residue may be to prevent nucleosome destabilization at the 3′ end of ORFs. These residues are located close to the dyad axis as well as at the base of the histone H3 αN helix.  In this study, we sought to understand the contribution of the DNA entry and exit points to nucleosome function in vivo and ascertain whether it plays a dynamic role in controlling the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA. In the crystal structure, the DNA at this region is organized exclusively by the histone H3 αN helix, and a single residue, Lys 42, within this helix interacts directly with DNA by inserting its side chain between the two DNA gyres. In spite of the fact that it has been shown that this interaction is comparatively weak within the nucleosome (Hall et al. 2009), we know from in vitro studies that mutating this residue makes purified nucleosomes inherently more mobile (Somers and Owen-Hughes 2009). We studied the H3-K42A mutation, and, although not a lethal substitution in vivo, yeast cells harboring this histone mutant as the sole source of histone H3 grow slowly and display a variety of phenotypes. The most striking observation is vastly increased transcriptional output of H3-K42A-expressing cells. Surprisingly, this residue is a substrate for methylation, and our data support a role for this modification in transcriptional repression. We therefore identified a critical interaction within the nucleosome that is targeted to fine-tune gene expression, and we propose that K42, and possibly its modification, serves as a structural “gatekeeper” of transcription. Remarkably, K42 is a “young” lysine evolutionarily; in most other eukaryotes, this residue is an arginine, suggesting recent evolution of its thus-far unidentified methylation machinery.  Go to: Results Histone H3-K42A mutants are pleiotropic in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Histone H3-K42 is a crucial residue that mediates the sole DNA contact of the nucleosome at the DNA entry and exit positions. (Fig. 1A). In the crystal structure (White et al. 2001), the K42 side chain is positioned in the solvent-exposed space between the two DNA helices. Its ɛ amino group points away from the nucleosome core and forms two hydrogen bonds with the phosphodiester backbone (Fig. 1B). To assess the contribution of these interactions to nucleosome function, we mutated this lysine residue to alanine, eliminating hydrogen bond potential (Fig. 1C), and performed phenotypic analyses.  Figure 1. Figure 1. Histone H3-K42A is a pleiotropic mutation, which disrupts a structurally important nucleosome surface. (A) The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae nucleosome highlighting histone H3 Lys 42 (orange) positioned at the DNA entry and exit points. The figure ... H3-K42A cells grow almost twice as slowly as wild-type yeast (data not shown). We scored the viability of this mutant under different conditions and found it was sensitive to (1) the DNA-damaging agents hydroxyurea (HU) and methyl-methanesulfonate; (2) benomyl, the microtubule-destabilizing drug; (3) 6-azauracil (6AU), a drug that interferes with transcription; and (4) temperatures >39°C (Fig. 1D). It did not display growth defects in the presence of camptothecin, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, or cold temperatures (data not shown). The pleiotropic behavior of H3-K42A indicates that this residue either is directly critical for numerous cellular processes, or its affect on nucleosome structure indirectly influences multiple pathways, possibly by influencing target gene expression. To test this, we analyzed the transcript profile of cells harboring H3-K42A. Strikingly, in these cells, we found that the expression of ∼42% of genes was altered in comparison with wild-type cells, with the majority of these (90%) up-regulated (Fig. 1E). The average fold increase for affected genes was two; the expression of a subset of loci was altered up to 12-fold above wild-type levels. No specific gene classes (based on Gene Ontology [GO] terms) were preferentially perturbed by histone H3-K42A (Supplemental Fig. S1). Additionally, no correlation was observed between chromosome location and transcriptional response to the H3-K42A substitution (data not shown).  We next examined whether these effects were specific to K42A or whether mutating other residues close to this nucleosome location exhibited similar phenotypes. We know that this region is important for faithful mitotic chromosome segregation, serving as a docking site for the recruitment of Sgo1p to pericentromeric regions during mitosis (Luo et al. 2010). This explains why mutations in this region, including K42A, are benomyl-sensitive, which is suppressed by overexpressing SGO1 (data not shown). We found that, although the H3-K42 region mutants do not confer 6AU sensitivity, we did observe increased expression of certain genes in these strains (Supplemental Fig. S2). However, the extent of this effect is nonuniform, and K42A exhibits the most severe transcriptional phenotype. Taken together, these observations highlight the structural importance and functionality of this nucleosome location and suggest that H3-K42 is a key residue within this region in transcriptional regulation.  Histone H3-K42A profoundly alters the S. cerevisiae transcriptome  To probe mechanisms underlying the potential role of this nucleosome surface during transcription, we sought to understand the hypertranscription phenotype of H3-K42A. The microarray analysis indicated that H3-K42A does not lead to erroneous derepression of transcription genome-wide, as the majority of genes typically repressed under the conditions tested were unaffected by H3-K42A. Therefore, we hypothesized that H3-K42A influences an active transcription cycle, and thus analyzed the dynamic expression of a single inducible locus: MET16. Our results indicate that the initial appearance of MET16 mRNA under inducing conditions was unaltered in H3-K42A cells, suggesting that regulation of the first round of transcription initiation is unaffected. However, MET16 transcript overaccumulates with time in the mutant cells (Fig. 2A), consistent with a defect in establishing a proper set point for transcription rate or inefficient transcription termination (Fig. 2A). MET16 expression level is not affected under repressive conditions, supporting the hypothesis that the effect of K42A depends on transcriptional activation (Fig. 2A).  Figure 2. Figure 2. Histone H3-K42A alters the S. cerevisiae transcriptome. (A) Kinetics of appearance of MET16 mRNA in cells expressing wild-type (WT) or K42A histone H3, as described in the Materials and Methods. Error bars represent the standard deviation between two ... To gain a higher resolution of the hypertranscription phenotype, we examined the length of RNA species produced in K42A cells transcriptome-wide. We hybridized total RNA extracted from mutant cells to the Affymetrix genomic tiling array, which interrogates the yeast genome at 5-bp resolution. A methodology was employed that identifies stretches of RNA that extend beyond the length of wild-type transcripts as well as differential RNA lengths within an ORF (Poorey et al. 2010). Strikingly, we found that ∼30% of all transcripts analyzed deviated from their expected length in H3-K42A cells (Supplemental Table S1). The majority (61%) of these transcripts also displayed increased abundance in the K42A microarray data set. The distribution of actual base pair length change was broad, ranging from 101 bp to 19,196 bp (median = 902 bp). Altered-length transcripts are categorized relative to the ORF of the affected locus as 5′ extensions, 5′ truncations, 3′ truncations, and 3′ extensions. Figure 2B shows that the K42A data set was significantly enriched for both 5′ and 3′ extensions, although truncation events were also detected. Significant overlap was seen between the 5′ and 3′ extension events, indicating that both events occur at the same locus with high frequency in K42A cells (Fig. 2C). A representative example of a transcript length change is shown in Figure 2D for YBR040W, a gene up-regulated 12-fold by H3-K42A. At this single locus, the transcript in K42A cells displayed both 5′ and 3′ extensions. This analysis indicates that H3-K42A drastically alters not only the amplitude, but also the “quality” of the yeast transcriptome.  Hypertranscription phenotype depends on elongation factors  Chromatin negatively impacts many aspects of transcription, and a wide variety of complex mechanisms exist to overcome this obstacle. Based on our analysis of MET16 expression, we hypothesized that histone H3-K42A influences the function of one or more such protein(s) in an event downstream from transcription initiation. We studied transcription component knockouts to probe how K42A elicits its transcriptional effects. We chose 20 nonessential gene mutants known to play roles in the initiation and elongation phases and initially scored their ability to influence K42A 6AU sensitivity. Our results indicate that the K42A 6AU phenotype was specifically suppressed by the deletion of the elongation factors SET2, ELC1, or RCO1 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, we found no genetic interactions between K42A and a series of genes involved primarily in transcription initiation, such as SET1, GCN5, GAL11, and BRE1 (data not shown). Table 1 lists all of the genes tested in this analysis.  Table 1. Table 1. Suppression analysis of histone H3-K42A through perturbations of transcription-related complexes Figure 3. Figure 3. Histone H3-K42 is an important residue during transcription elongation. (A) Strains with the indicated genotypes were plated as described in the Materials and Methods to detect transcriptional elongation defects. (B) Quantitative RT–PCR analysis ... As certain elongation factor deletions are themselves sensitive to 6AU—such as dst1Δ and paf1Δ, for example—we sought additional evidence for the ability of elongation factors to suppress K42A-mediated hypertranscription. We employed quantitative RT–PCR to monitor the expression of three specific loci up-regulated by H3-K42A: YBR040W, YNR062C, and YKL221W. We found that deletions of SET2, DST1, RCO1, or PAF1 completely reversed the ability of H3-K42A to increase transcription of these genes (Fig. 3B). These interactions are consistent with the idea that K42A hypertranscription reflects hyperelongation. If we explain the 6AU sensitivity of K42A as the inability of these cells to generate essential transcripts when nucleotide pools are decreased, perhaps a direct consequence of the extent of genome-wide hypertranscription, then mutations that decrease elongation rates will allow those nucleotides to be used more effectively and restore growth in the presence of 6AU. In contrast, although elc1Δ suppressed the 6AU phenotype of K42A, this strain did not alter the expression pattern of the three test genes. It was also noted that ubp8Δ, a gene involved in the transition between transcription initiation and elongation, had a slight but reproducible suppressive effect in both assays tested (Fig. 3B; data not shown).  Since SET2 is the histone methyltransferase for H3-K36, a residue in close proximity to H3-K42, we tested whether substitutions at H3-K36 would also suppress K42A and found that H3-K36A suppressed K42A slow growth and hypertranscription phenotypes as well as its 6AU sensitivity both in cis and in trans (Fig. 3A; data not shown).  These genetic data show a striking pattern: The H3-K42A phenotypes are specifically suppressed by a subset of elongation factor mutants, suggesting that the mode of action of this allele may be to induce hyperelongation or uncontrolled elongation. The altered elongation rate might in turn explain the altered 3′ end formation observed in >1000 different genes. To test this hypothesis, we determined the levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) actively involved in elongation as opposed to initiation by analyzing the phosphorylation status of its C-terminal domain (CTD). Ser 2 phosphorylation of the CTD is a hallmark of the elongating RNAPII; immunoblot analysis indicated that the levels of this modification were increased in K42A-expressing cells compared with the wild type. In contrast, CTD phosphorylation at Ser 5 is important during transcription initiation; K42A did not affect this modification significantly (Fig. 3C).  Histone H3-K42A alters chromatin structure at actively transcribed genes  Data presented thus far suggest a potential role for H3-K42 in negatively regulating transcription elongation and support the removal of this inhibitory effect by the K42A substitution. Given that nucleosomes harboring a mutation at this site display increased mobility in vitro, we hypothesized that the K42A phenotype may be due to a direct effect on chromatin structure. Figure 2A shows that H3-K42A increases the levels of MET16 expression under inducing conditions specifically, indicating that activated transcription is necessary to reveal the K42A phenotype. Therefore, we hypothesized that K42A-containing nucleosomes give rise to an altered chromatin template that is more permissive to transcription once initiated. We determined the occupancy of histone H3 at genes up-regulated by the H3-K42A mutation by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), as a decrease in nucleosome density across a gene would promote transcription. Additionally, the generation of 5′ truncated transcripts, as seen in K42A cells, has been accounted for previously by the lack of restoration of a repressive chromatin state in the wake of RNAPII elongation (Carrozza et al. 2005; Joshi and Struhl 2005; Keogh et al. 2005). Figure 3D indicates that there is a significant loss of histone H3 at these loci in K42A cells. Interestingly, in two out of the three genes tested, this difference was evident only at the 3′ end of the ORF. There was no detectable difference in H3 occupancy at genes that are unresponsive to K42A; namely, ACT1, inactivated MET16, and an intergenic noncoding locus in K42A cells (data not shown).  During transcription, nucleosomes are continuously disassembled and reassembled by histone chaperones to facilitate the passage of RNAPII along a gene while maintaining a closed state to prevent aberrant initiation (Schwabish and Struhl 2004; Kulaeva et al. 2007). Spt6p is an essential histone chaperone that binds histone H3 and is important for replacing histone H3/H4 tetramers behind RNAPII. Cells expressing a temperature-sensitive (ts) allele of SPT6, spt6-1004, display phenotypes very similar to that of H3-K42A at semipermissive conditions with respect to transcription up-regulation, decreased nucleosome density in gene coding regions, intragenic transcription, and temperature sensitivity (Kaplan et al. 2003; Cheung et al. 2008). Based on these similarities, we hypothesized that the phenotypes associated with K42A result from defects in the SPT6 pathway, and, accordingly, we expected no exacerbation of the common phenotypes when both alleles are combined. We integrated the spt6-1004 allele into our histone knockout strain background and observed no enhancement of spt6-1004 temperature sensitivity by H3-K42A. Furthermore, mRNA length changes in spt6-1004 cells were not altered in the presence of K42A and at either permissive or semipermissive temperatures (Supplemental Fig. S4).  Histone H3-K42 is dimethylated in S. cerevisiae.  During the course of this work, our ongoing proteomic effort to identify novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the globular core of nucleosomes revealed, to our surprise, that histone H3-K42 can be methylated in yeast. We detected both monomethyl and dimethyl forms of K42 using electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in three independent samples (Fig. 4A).  Figure 4. Figure 4. Histone H3-K42 is dimethylated in S. cerevisiae. (A) Electrospray tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS) of the doubly charged dimethylated peptide: YK(dimet.)PGTVALR, m/z 516.869, recorded using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer in an LC-MS/MS experiment ... Residue 42 is an arginine in all other eukaryotes except Ascomycota (Supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that, if this lysine is indeed modified, the methylation machinery must be newly evolved. With considerable skepticism, we raised an antibody against a K42 dimethyl-containing peptide. With such an antiserum in hand, experiments to probe for this modification in S. cerevisiae by an independent method became possible. The dot blot in Figure 4B indicates the specificity of this antibody in recognizing the dimethyl-modified histone peptide over the unmodified using competition assays with specific and control unmodified peptides. Immunoblot analyses (Fig. 4C) supported the specificity of the antibody and the existence in vivo of dimethylation of H3-K42 (H3-K42me2). These data illustrate that the serum detects its antigen in both purified histones and whole-cell protein extracts from yeast expressing wild-type histone H3, but fails to detect histone H3 from strains harboring mutations at residue 42 or unmodified bacterially expressed yeast histone H3. Additionally, the modified band in the immunoblot could be competed away by addition of either a monomethyl or dimethylated histone peptide, but not trimethyl or unmodified control peptides.  Histone H3-K42 methylation is enriched at the 5′ end of genes  In our efforts to characterize histone H3-K42me2, we undertook ChIP-on-chip analysis using the methyl-specific antibody to probe for the localization of this modification across the yeast genome. Histone H3-K42 dimethylation was significantly enriched at 491 genome locations distributed seemingly randomly across all 16 S. cerevisiae chromosomes (at a false discovery rate [FDR] threshold of <0.1). The modification was enriched in intragenic regions (65%); however, a substantial proportion was also located in intergenic regions (35%). Figure 4D shows the distribution of H3-K42me2 averaged genome-wide across all genes, indicating enrichment in the 5′ half of genes.  Establishing a genetic system to probe the possible function of histone H3-K42me2  We next sought in vivo evidence for the functionality of this modification in yeast. The H3-K42A mutation eliminates this modification in cells, and therefore the phenotypes associated with this substitution give us some insight into the effects of losing H3-K42me2. However, alanine is not a conservative substitution and, as stated previously, in addition to preventing K42 methylation, it also eliminates potential K42 hydrogen bonding with DNA. We therefore mutated K42 to arginine to mimic a constitutively nonmethylated form of K42 while maintaining hydrogen-bonding potential. Unfortunately, this allele displayed no detectable phenotypes in any assay tested (Fig. 5A; data not shown). We rationalized that perhaps arginine can act a substrate for methylation at this site, supported by the presence of arginine at this position in all other eukaryotes. However, we were unsuccessful in detecting methylation at this site in cells by mass spectrometry. Therefore, we chose to use K42Q as a surrogate for a demethylated version of K42, as it cannot be methylated but is predicted to retain the H bond to DNA (Supplemental Fig. S6).  Figure 5. Figure 5. Histone H3-K42me2 may play a role in transcription. (A) Strains expressing the indicated histone H3 allele were assayed for their sensitivity to 6AU to detect transcription elongation defects. ppr1Δ acts as a positive control for comparison. ( ... A complementary approach that is widely used to determine the contribution of a PTM in vivo is to generate a mutation at the site that mimics a constitutively modified state. The closest natural mimics to a methylated lysine are leucine and methionine, which represent monomethyl and dimethyl side chains, respectively. Structures of nucleosomes predicted by energy minimization (Guex and Peitsch 1997) harboring these substitutions are illustrated in Supplemental Figure S6. Although the length of the side chains of the substituted amino acids do not extend as far as lysine, their solvent exposure seems unaltered, and it could be argued that the recognition of their functional groups is similar to that of the modified and unmodified native residues. In particular, the solvent-exposed side chain terminal dimethyl of leucine has a contour strikingly similar to that of dimethyl lysine.  Histone H3-K42me2 may regulate transcription  We generated strains that expressed either H3-K42Q, H3-K42L, or H3-K42M as their sole source of histone H3 and monitored their phenotypes. Initially we determined each strains' sensitivity to 6AU, and Figure 5A shows that our data are consistent with the modification status dictating the sensitivity to this drug. Cells expressing the unmodified mimic K42Q behaved like K42A and were sensitive to the drug, whereas cells expressing the modified mimics K42L and K42M were unaffected by 6AU.  To ask whether the effect of K42A on transcription might be related to H3-K42 modification state, we analyzed K42Q and K42L transcript profiles. Histone H3-K42Q altered expression of ∼25% of the genome and, as in K42A-expressing cells, the majority (∼77%) of these genes were up-regulated. K42L, however, had a more modest phenotype, resulting in dysregulation of only 7% of the genome. Strikingly, however, the major effect of K42L was to down-regulate gene expression (Table 2). We next determined the number and identity of target genes common to the three profiling experiments (Fig. 5B). There was high concordance between genes affected by both K42A and K42Q and the direction of change in expression of these genes. One-hundred-thirty-five genes were affected by all three alleles: K42A, K42Q, and K42L. Whereas the direction of change in these genes was concordant in K42A and K42Q, ∼40% of the genes were oppositely regulated by K42L. Additionally, almost all genes common to the K42A and K42L data sets were differentially regulated by each mutation. Collectively, these data support a model in which K42 methylation is a repressive mark for transcription.  Table 2. Table 2. Summary of microarray analysis of the indicated histone H3-K42 mutants A more direct test of this model is to compare the loci that are enriched by K42 methylation, as determined by our ChIP-on-chip experiment, and those genes whose expression was dysregulated by K42 alleles. Consistent with K42 methylation acting to inhibit transcription, we found significant overlap between genomic regions containing this modification and the loci up-regulated by both K42A (P-value = 1.6 × 10−4) and K42Q (P-value = 3.1 × 10−6) substitutions, both of which mimic a lack of K42me2. Consistently, the relatively few genes that showed decreased expression in the presence of K42A or K42Q did not show significant enrichment of H3-K42me2, consistent with these representing secondary effects. Furthermore, we found that loci down-regulated by the constitutively methylated mimic K42L were significantly enriched for nucleosomes containing H3-K42me2 (P-value = 1.3 × 10−4).  Given our knowledge that H3-K42A causes mRNA length changes, we asked whether other K42 alleles displayed a similar effect. Specifically, we determined the ability of K42 mutations to initiate transcription at a site downstream from the natural start site. We used a reporter in which the HIS3 ORF was driven by the intragenic cryptic promoter in the FLO8 gene (Fig. 5C; Cheung et al. 2008) and assayed the ability of K42 mutants to grow in the absence of histidine. Our results indicate that, similar to K42A, the demethylated H3-K42 mimic K42Q was capable of inducing cryptic promoter–HIS3 expression, whereas K42L, the constitutively methylated mimic, was not—consistent with a potential role for H3-K42me2 in preventing erroneous transcription (Fig. 5C).  Components of the PAF1 complex influence histone H3-K42 dimethylation  The transcript-profiling studies of the different K42 alleles suggested that methylation of this site may be important in the regulation of transcription, and our genetic investigations into the K42A allele implied a role for the modification during transcription elongation. To directly test this hypothesis, we determined whether strains with defects in transcription elongation might signal through H3-K42me2 and perturb the abundance of this modification. We quantified the levels of H3-K42me2 in 87 deletion strains that either lacked a known nonessential transcription elongation factor or were known to be sensitive to 6AU (Supplemental Table S2). Strikingly, the only strains that showed any effect on the levels of H3-K42me2 were those lacking a component of the PAF1 elongation complex. ctr9Δ and hpr1Δ showed statistically significant decreases in H3-K42me2 and rtf1Δ displayed a modest defect in this modification. ccr4Δ, paf1Δ, and spt13Δ displayed elevated levels (up to threefold that of wild type) of this methyl mark (Fig. 5D).  Go to: Discussion Comprehensive histone mutagenesis in yeast has shown that the DNA entry/exit point of the nucleosome does not tolerate substitutions. We identified a group of histone H3 residues in this location that influence transcription, the most critical among them being Lys 42. We showed that the integrity of K42 is essential to maintain the correct transcriptional output in a yeast cell, potentially explaining why certain mutations at this site are pleiotropic. This is a novel site of methylation in yeast: We used a K42-methyl-specific antibody in conjunction with a genetic approach to probe the function and biological significance of this modification. Given its nucleosomal location and the results of our studies, we believe that K42, and possibly its methylation, acts as a transcriptional “gatekeeper” by limiting access to nucleosomal DNA during transcriptional elongation.  The histone H3-K42A substitution results in the abundance of many transcripts, as well as substantial effects on the lengths of many mRNAs. Considering how the elongating RNAPII is influenced by many negative factors, not least the chromatin template, and that it is not uncommon for this massive complex to halt, stall, or become completely arrested (for review, see Shilatifard 2004), we believe that chromatin containing K42A is intrinsically less restrictive to the elongating RNAPII protein complex because the “gate is constitutively open,” promoting more efficient elongation. The two most prominent changes in mRNA length that we detected in K42A cells are those that generate 5′ and 3′ extensions, indicating that the effect of K42A-containing nucleosomes extends beyond canonical transcriptional units. The inability of transcription to be terminated may reflect the permissiveness of K42A chromatin to elongating RNAPII. We hypothesize that, once RNAPII is engaged in transcription, the chromatin landscape in K42A cells is sufficient to promote elongation through normal stop signals even in the presence of transcription-terminating factors. In support of this, our data show that, in K42A cells, we detected an increase in elongation-competent RNAPII, as monitored by increased Ser 2 phosphorylation of the CTD. Furthermore, we found that, by deleting positive elongation factors, the hypertranscription phenotype of K42A was suppressed. For example, DST1 is required to re-engage stalled RNAPII (Christie et al. 1994; Kulish, Struhl 2001); by eliminating DST1, we decreased the number of RNAPII complexes that complete transcripts, thereby masking K42A phenotypes. Similar results were seen for mutants of PAF1, an RNAPII-associated protein required to recruit proelongation factors to actively transcribed genes, including Rad6p (Wood et al. 2003), Dot1p (Krogan et al. 2003), and the FACT complex (for review, see Jaehning 2010). Since our tiling array analysis does not assign strand specificity, ambiguity exists when transcripts span multiple loci and, consequently, ∼30% of 5′ extensions could be classified as 3′ extensions of an upstream locus resulting from hyperelongation (Supplemental Fig. S7). Additionally, our data indicate that K42A cells do not induce expression of repressed genes, illustrating that K42A chromatin does not generically promote ectopic recruitment of initiation complexes genome-wide. These data, taken together with the fact that deleting nonessential initiation factors did not alter K42A phenotypes, suggest that aberrant transcription elongation efficiency specifically underlies K42A-mediated transcriptional phenotypes.  What are the mechanisms behind the “open gate” state of nucleosomes in K42A cells? Our ChIP analyses reveal that there is a loss of histone H3 in K42A cells at certain actively transcribed genes, which is more apparent at the 3′ end of the ORF. We also provided genetic evidence suggesting that both K42A and spt6-1004, a Ts− mutation in the histone chaperone Spt6p, feed into the same pathway and are mechanistically similar. This raises the hypothesis that the histone H3-containing K42A mutation may not be redeposited efficiently in the wake of RNAPII elongation. However, this explanation alone is insufficient to account for the greater number of transcripts affected by K42A cells than in spt6-1004. We speculate that the permissiveness of elongation in K42A cells may arise from inefficient redeposition of histone H3 in conjunction with increased mobility of K42A nucleosomes, as evidenced in vitro.  Our discovery that H3-K42 is methylated in yeast corroborates the importance of this nucleosome residue, providing us with a mechanism by which a cell regulates this transcriptional gatekeeper. The contrasting transcript profiles of methyl (K42L) and nonmethyl (K42Q) mimics of K42 provide indirect evidence to support such a mechanism. Furthermore, we saw a direct effect on methylation levels in mutants with a defective Paf1 complex. This suggests that perturbations to elongation, specifically through the Paf1 complex pathway, influence K42me2 abundance, placing this modification in the Paf1 pathway. The exact mechanism underlying the pattern of H3-K42me2 variations in the individual Paf1 complex subunit deletions is likely to be complex, although it is attractive to speculate that the Paf1 complex is necessary for the recruitment of the elusive K42-specific methyltransferase. In support of this notion, deletion of PAF1 leads to both initiation of transcription at intragenic cryptic promoters (Chu et al. 2007) and 3′ extensions of certain mRNAs (Penheiter et al. 2005; Sheldon et al. 2005), similar to H3-K42A.  Residue 42 in histone H3 is arginine in most other braches of eukaryotes, including Basidiomycetes (Supplemental Fig. S6), indicating that the lysine substitution appeared within the last 400 million years, after Ascomycota and Basidiomycota diverged. Therefore, H3-K42me2 is not a conserved modification, and, strikingly, the ability to methylate this residue is a very recent innovation in evolution, possibly through neo- or subfunctionalization of a conserved enzyme. To explore what protein might have evolved such a function, we searched for a K42-specific methyltransferase in yeast. Unfortunately, to date, our efforts have proved futile, as individual deletion of all 62 known annotated methyltransferases in yeast, including all SET domain proteins and Dot1p, failed to abolish H3-K42me2, as detected by immunoblotting (data not shown). From this analysis, we assume that Ascomycetes have co-opted a noncanonical methyltransferase to methylate H3-K42, or, alternatively, redundant enzymes may modify K42.  Although the prevalence of K42me2 histones throughout the genome is limited, as illustrated by our ChIP-on-chip data, this might indicate that there was a selective advantage to yeast in acquiring this novel modification at those particular sites. It is attractive to interpret the K42A and K42Q mutant data as reflecting the loss of H3-K42me2, and that the ability of the cell to regulate the transcriptional output may be the selective pressure driving the evolution of the modification. In support of this idea, there is a correlation between genes affected by nonmethyl mimics K42A and K42Q and those enriched with the modification. Additionally, these alleles permit the production of intragenic transcripts, whereas the methyl-mimic K42L suppresses it. Although it has been shown that additional nucleosome core mutations promote intragenic transcription, our study illustrates how this phenomenon may be regulated within the cell by PTM. One tempting model might be that H3-K43me2 regulates the interaction between Spt6p and histone H3.  To uncover alternative sources of selective pressure promoting histone H3-K42me2 evolution, we took a bioinformatic approach and looked for differences in specific chromatin-related proteins between the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, the latter lacking H3-K42. One potentially relevant candidate is the linker histone, H1, which binds DNA at the nucleosome entry and exit points (Thoma et al. 1979), stabilizing the nucleosome and restricting transcription in most eukaryotes. However, S. cerevisiae and other Ascomycetes species lack a canonical H1 protein. Given that histone H3-K42 is positioned in the same nucleosomal region, and our data suggest a role for H3-K42me in transcriptional inhibition, it is plausible that Ascomycota have evolved this modification to serve the function of canonical histone H1. In support of this, our sequence analysis showed that histone H1 divergence largely conforms to phylogeny; H1 sequences from different Basidiomycetes species are more similar than those from Ascomycetes. Similarly, we found that the fungal distribution of a second protein, HP-1, and, presumably, the histone H3-K9 methylation system that generates the repressive chromatin mark that it recognizes follow a similar pattern. Interestingly, in this example, Ascomycetes species lack any detectable homolog of HP-1. These preliminary findings suggest that the lack of canonical histone H1 and/or H3-K9 methylation in Ascomycota could have driven the evolution of a novel repressive chromatin mark, H3-K42me2. Future experiments will be required to directly test this hypothesis.  If we assume that the lack of conservation of this site among higher eukaryotes implies that K42 methylation is a recent acquisition of Ascomycota, we conclude that its function in attenuating transcriptional output provides an evolutionary advantage to these species. We know that, under certain growth conditions, wild-type yeast actively produce cryptic transcripts that play physiological roles (Ono et al. 2005; Bickel and Morris 2006), and that certain intragenic transcripts can be translated into functional proteins, increasing the complexity of the yeast proteome, perhaps providing the cell with additional capabilities and functions. Given that up to 17% of genes within the yeast genome contain intragenic cryptic initiation sites, regulatory mechanisms must be in place to modulate the extent of this form of pervasive transcription, perhaps limiting it temporally or under certain conditions. Methylation of the gate to the globular core of the nucleosome at histone H3-K42 is one such mechanism.  Go to: Materials and methods Strains and media  Standard laboratory techniques for budding yeast manipulations were used. The previously described yeast strain JPY12 (Park et al. 2002) was the parental strain employed for all genetic manipulations unless otherwise noted. A uracil auxotrophy derivative of JPY12, EMHY510, was generated. EMHY510 used in 6AU growth assay was transformed with the URA3 CEN plasmid pRS316. Deletion strains of JPY12 were made using a PCR product amplified from the appropriate BY4742 strain of the KanMX deletion collection. Colony PCR was used to verify the correct integration of the knockout cassette in JPY12. Supplemental Table S3 contains a complete list of strains generated. The Ts− allele of SPT6, spt6-1004, was integrated in EMHY510 by transformation with the SphI-linearized form of the integrating plasmid pCK125 and selecting on synthetic complete (SC)–Ura. Ura+ transformants were streaked to YPD, replica-plated to 5FOA, and subsequently screened for a Ts− phenotype at 39°C. Colony PCR was used to verify the correct targeting of the Ts− alleles.  All media were supplemented with 0.64 mM adenine. SC medium contained 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB, Difco), 2% (w/v) glucose, and 2% (w/v) bacto-agar, supplemented with 2% (w/v) “Hopkins mix” amino acids. HU medium was prepared by supplementing SC with 200 mM HU. Benomyl was added to YPD-rich medium at a concentration of 30 μg/mL. 6AU-containing medium was SC–Ura containing 200 μg/mL 6AU.  Plasmids  Plasmids pDM18 (Park et al. 2002) and pEMH7 (Hyland et al. 2005) carrying HHT2 and HHF2 and pJP11 encoding HHT1 and HHF1 were used in this study. pEMH17 was generated whereby the NaeI/SacI fragment from pEMH7 was excised and subcloned into pRS315. Histone H3 mutants were engineered into pEMH7, as described previously (Hyland et al. 2005). Plasmids were sequenced with oligonucleotides JB6505 and JB6504. Plasmid pBS4 harboring histone H3-K36A mutation was obtained from B. Strahl. The integrating plasmid pCK125 harboring spt6-1004 was provided by F. Winston.  Growth assays  Yeast strains used in growth assays were grown overnight in either YPD or selective medium where appropriate. The next day, cultures were diluted to an OD A600 of 0.5, and fivefold serial dilutions were plated on both growth control plates and experimental plates. Plates were photographed after 2 d of incubation at 30°C.  Intragenic transcript detection  The FLO8 intragenic reporter was generated by V. Cheng and F. Winston. The reporter construct (4.5 kb) was amplified from strain VC-377-1B using primers JB11738 and JB11739, and was used to transform EMHY510 harboring pBS4 (H3-K36A). Transformants were selected on YPD + G418 and were screened by colony PCR for the correct integration, generating strain EMHY578. This strain was transformed with pEMH17 harboring histone alleles, and pBS4 was shuffled. Transformants were patched onto YPD + G418, incubated for 2 d at 30°C, replica-plated to SC–His, and further incubated for 2 d at 30°C. A His+ phenotype in this assay reports inappropriate intragenic transcription initiation.  Transcriptional profiling; data acquisition and normalization  RNA was extracted from log phase cultures of JPY12 strains expressing histone H3-K42 mutations using the acid phenol method. Ten micrograms of total RNA of two replicate samples was used to create labeled cRNA cocktails, as outlined in the Affymetrix protocol. Fifteen micrograms each of labeled cRNA was hybridized on the Affymetrix GeneChip Yeast 2.0 arrays. Data analysis was conducted on the chips' CEL file probe signal values at the Affymetrix probe pair level using the statistical technique Robust Multiarray Analysis (Irizarry et al. 2003) with the bioconductor package Affy. Contrast normalization was carried out as described in Bolstad et al. (2003) using the following control probes: “Bacillus subtilis,” “Bacteriophage,” “Escherichia coli,” “synthetic insert,” and other non-S. cerevisiae “control” probes, excluding all Schizosaccharomyces pombe and S. cerevisiae “control” probes on the microarray. Between-condition and between-replicate variations were examined with pairwise MvA plots, where the base 2 log ratios (M) between two samples are plotted against their averaged base 2 log signals (A). An empirical Bayes method with lognormal–normal modeling, as implemented in the bioconductor package EBarrays, was used to estimate the posterior probabilities of the differential expression of genes between the sample conditions (Kendziorski et al. 2003; Newton et al. 2001). The criterion of a posterior probability >0.5 was used to produce the differentially expressed gene list. Bioconductor packages are found at http://www.bioconductor.org, and all computations were performed under the R environment (http://www.r-project.org). The raw data were deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession number GSE13889.  Real-time quantitative PCR  Strains were grown in rich medium supplemented with 0.64 mM adenine and were harvested at log phase. RNA was prepared from these cells and treated with DNase, and 500 ng of this RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Following RNase H digestion, cDNA equivalent to 25 ng of input RNA was added to a real-time PCR reaction using the Applied Biosystems SYBR Green RT–PCR system. Reactions were run in a 96-well plate using the Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT fast real-time PCR system. The CT values for expression of gene of interest were compared with that of an internal ACT1 control. The primers used for ACT1 amplification were JB9639 and JB9640 for YBR040W; JB10085 and JB10086 for YNR062C; JB10091 and JB10092 for YKL221W; JB10112 and JB10113 for MCD1; and JB12292 and JB12293.  Analysis of dynamic MET16 transcription  Overnight cultures of the indicated strains were diluted 1:20 in rich medium and grown to log phase. Cells were pelleted at room temperature, washed once in water, and added to either SC–Met or SC prewarmed medium, a procedure that took up to 4 min. Aliquots of cells were taken at regular intervals, added to equal volume of ice-cold 100% ethanol, and centrifuged immediately at 4°C. Cell pellets were frozen on dry ice. RNA was extracted from cells and the MET16 transcript was analyzed by quantitative RT–PCR as above using primers JB12026 and JB12027. ACT1 served as the internal control.  Immunoblotting  Whole-cell lysates were prepared from 2.5 A600 units of cells for SDS-PAGE using the alkaline lysis method as described previously (Kushnirov 2000). For histone analyses, lysates were resolved on 4%–20% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies against the C terminus of histone H3 (1:1000 dilution) (Abcam, ab1971), and histone H3-K42me-specific (1:500 dilution) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies against rabbit IgGs (Amersham Pharmacia) and chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). Polyclonal anti-H3-K42me antibodies, generated by Upstate Biotechnologies, were raised in rabbits upon exposure to the H3 peptide PPEMH2, 39-HRYKme2PGTVAL-48. Antibodies were affinity-purified from the rabbit serum using PPEMH2 and eluted at pH 1.7. Peptide competition of Western blots was undertaken by incubating the H3-K42me2-specific antibody with 0.5 μg/mL appropriate peptide (PPEMH1, 39-HRYKPGTVAL-48; PPEMH2, 39-HRYKme2PGTVAL-48; PPEMH3, 39-HRYKmePGTVAL-48; and PPEMH4, 39-HRYKme3PGTVAL-48 ) for 1 h at room temperature prior to probing the blot. Analysis of the phosphorylation state of the C terminus of RNAPII was undertaken as described previously (Patturajan et al. 1998).  Histone H3 ChIP  The protocol employed was described previously (Dedon et al. 1991) using the histone H3 C-terminal antibody (Abcam, ab1971). Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantitated using quantitative RT–PCR as outlined in the preceding section. The following primer pairs were used: JB10085 and JB10086 for 3′ YBR040W, JB12360 and JB12361 for 5′ YBR040W, JB12450 and JB12451 for 5′ YBR284, JB10114 and JB10115 for 3′ YBR284, JB12452 and JB12453 for 5′ YNR062C, and JB12454 and JB12455 for 3′ YNR062C.  mRNA length change detection  RNA was extracted from log phase cultures of JPY12 strains expressing histone H3-K42 mutations using the acid phenol method. The analysis of genomic tiling array data was carried out by methods described in Poorey et al. (2010). TAS (Tiling Analysis software version 1.1) was used to analyze the raw array data to generate graph files containing log2 (fold change) or differential signals. Differential signals were calculated using the Hodges-Leman estimator, which is associated with the Wicoxon rank-sum test, over a sliding window of 500 bp for treatment versus control. We applied a 0.3 cutoff to the absolute value of log2 (fold change)—i.e., the differential signal data—to identify differentially expressed segments. By comparing these segments to annotated 5′ and 3′ ends, we identified RNA length changes in mutants relative to control. These changes were categorized as 5′ extensions, 5′ truncations, 3′ truncations, or 5′ extensions. Putative length changes that did not satisfy certain criteria—including minimum overlap with the annotations, minimum length change, and minimum signal difference—were filtered out (Poorey et al. 2010).  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children. However, DNA copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases1, 2, 3, 4. To explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric GBM samples. Somatic mutations in the H3.3-ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). Recurrent mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. Mutations in ATRX (α-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked)5 and DAXX (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for H3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres6, 7, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation. Somatic TP53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with H3F3A and/or ATRX mutations. Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to GBM and highly prevalent in children and young adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. This is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult GBM pathogenesis.

Figure 3 right Main Main• Methods• References• Acknowledgements• Author information• Supplementary information Brain tumours are currently the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity in children. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumour and the first cancer to be comprehensively profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium. Whereas GBM is less common in the paediatric setting than in adults, affected children show dismal outcomes similar to adult patients, and the vast majority will die within a few years of diagnosis despite aggressive therapeutic approaches. Tumours arise de novo (primary GBM) and are morphologically indistinguishable from their adult counterparts. A number of comprehensive studies have identified transcriptome-based subgroups and indicator mutations in adult GBM, and have thus enabled its molecular sub-classification8, 9, 10, 11. In contrast, although we and others have demonstrated the presence of distinct molecular subsets of childhood GBM and described different genetic alterations compared to adult cases, the paediatric disease remains understudied1, 2, 3, 4, 12. There is currently insufficient information to improve disease management, and because conventional treatments universally fail, there is a crucial need to identify relevant targets for the design of new therapeutic agents.  To decipher the molecular pathogenesis of paediatric GBM, we undertook a comprehensive mutation analysis in protein-coding genes by performing whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 48 well-characterized paediatric GBMs, including 6 patients for whom we had matched non-tumour (germline) DNA. Samples from the tumour core containing more than 90% neoplastic tissue were collected from patients aged between 3 and 20 years (Supplementary Table 1). Coding regions of the genome were enriched by capture with the Illumina TruSeq kit and sequenced with 100-base-pairs paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Supplementary Methods). The median coverage of each base in the targeted regions was 61-fold, and 91% of the bases were represented by at least 10 reads (Supplementary Table 2). We identified 87 somatic mutations in 80 genes among the 6 tumours for which we had matched constitutive DNA. The mutation count per tumour ranged from 3 to 31, with a mean of 15 (Supplementary Table 3). This is much lower than the rate observed using Sanger sequencing in other solid tumours including adult GBM11, but somewhat higher than in another paediatric brain tumour, medulloblastoma13 (Supplementary Table 4). Relevant mutations (as defined below) were validated by Sanger sequencing.  Initially, we focused on the distribution of somatic, non-silent protein-coding mutations in the six tumours with matched germline DNA. Four samples had recurrent heterozygous mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone variant H3.3. Both mutations were single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), in two samples changing lysine 27 to methionine (K27M), and in two samples changing glycine 34 to arginine (G34R) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 3). These mutations are particularly interesting because histone genes are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes (Fig. 1b), and to our knowledge no human disorders have specifically been associated with mutations in histones, including H3.3. Both mutations are at or very near positions in the amino-terminal tail of the protein that undergo important post-translational modifications associated with either transcriptional repression (K27) or activation (K36) (Fig. 1b). All four samples additionally harboured mutations in ATRX, which encodes a member of a transcription/chromatin remodelling complex required for the incorporation of H3.3 at pericentric heterochromatin and at telomeres, as well as at several transcription factor binding sites7, 14, 15, 16, 17. We extended our WES analysis to 42 additional tumour samples and focused on ATRX and H3F3A, as well as DAXX (because the gene product heterodimerizes with ATRX and participates in H3.3 recruitment to DNA6, 7). A total of 15 samples had heterozygous H3.3 mutations (9 K27M, 5 G34R, 1 G34V) and 14 samples had a mutation in ATRX, including frameshift insertions/deletions (6 samples), gains of a stop codon (4 samples), and missense SNVs (4 samples). Nearly all of the ATRX mutations occurred either within the carboxy-terminal helicase domain or led to truncation of the protein upstream of this domain (Fig. 1c). Mutations were accompanied by an absence of detectable ATRX protein by immunohistochemistry in samples for which paraffin material was available (Supplementary Fig. 1). Two samples had heterozygous DAXX mutations, simultaneously with an ATRX mutation in one sample (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 3). Overall, 21 of 48 samples (44%) had a mutation in at least one of these three genes. Notably, we also identified TP53 mutations in 26 samples (25 somatic, 1 germline in PGBM26), which overlapped significantly with samples that had ATRX, DAXX and/or H3F3A mutations (18/21 cases, 86%, Fig. 1d; P = 1.1 × 10−4, permutation test). A list of all mutations discovered by WES in selected genes associated with GBM is given in Supplementary Table 5.  Figure 1: Most frequent mutations in paediatric GBM. Most frequent mutations in paediatric GBM. a, Most frequent somatic mutations in 48 paediatric glioblastoma tumours. Mutations identified in genes listed in this table were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and were not present in dbSNP nor in the 1000 Genomes data set (October 2011), except for the TP53 SNP at R273, which is associated with cancer. Detailed description of the mutations in affected samples is provided in Supplementary Table 5. b, Three recurrent non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were observed in H3F3A. The K27M, G34R and G34V mutations are shown in the context of the common post-translational modifications of the H3.3 N-terminal tail, which regulates the histone code. H3.3 has 136 amino acids, and is highly conserved across species from mammals to plants, including the residues subject to mutation in paediatric GBM (see multiple alignment of amino acids 11 to 60). c, Schematic of the mutations observed in ATRX in the 48 WES samples. d, Schematic of the overlap between mutations affecting ATRX-DAXX, H3F3A and TP53.

To investigate whether H3F3A mutations are specific to GBM and/or paediatric disease, we sequenced this gene in 784 glioma samples from all grades and histological diagnoses across the entire age range (Fig. 2a). H3.3 mutations were highly specific to GBM and were much more prevalent in the paediatric setting (32/90, 36%), although they also occurred rarely in young adults with GBM (11/318, 3%) (Fig. 2b). K27M-H3.3 mutations occurred mainly in younger patients (median age 11 years, range 5–29) and thalamic GBM (Supplementary Table 1), whereas G34R- or G34V-H3.3 mutations occurred in older patients (median age 20 years, range 9–42) and in tumours of the cerebral hemispheres (Fig. 2b). Further comparison of our data set with adult GBM databases8, 10, 11, 18, 19 indicated limited overlap in frequently mutated genes between paediatric GBM and any of the four previously described adult GBM subtypes18 (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 6).

No H3.3 mutations were identified in older patients with GBM. c, Comparison of the most frequently mutated genes in paediatric and adult GBM shows that H3F3A, ATRX and DAXX mutations are largely specific to paediatric disease. Except for similarities in the mutation rate for TP53 and PDGFRA with the previously identified proneural adult GBM subgroup, the rate and type of genes mutated were distinct between paediatric and adult GBM whatever the molecular subgroup27 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Data for adult GBM regarding other genes included in the table was compiled from refs 11 and 18. d, ATRX and DAXX immunohistochemical staining of a paediatric GBM tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 124 samples.

A follow-up study found ATRX mutations in a series of cancers, including GBM, where ATRX (but not DAXX) mutations were identified in 3/21 paediatric GBMs (14%) and 8/122 adult GBMs (7%)20. To evaluate further the prevalence of ATRX and DAXX mutations in paediatric GBM, we performed immunostaining for these proteins on a well-characterized tissue microarray (TMA) with samples from 124 paediatric GBM patients. Lack of immunopositivity for ATRX was seen in 35% of cases (40/113 scored, 22 females and 18 males) and for DAXX in 6% (7/124 scored) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall, 37% of samples had lost nuclear expression of either factor, corroborating our WES findings. Strikingly, ATRX-DAXX mutations (as assessed by direct sequencing or loss of protein expression) were found in 100% of G34-H3.3 mutant cases in the larger cohort of GBMs (13/13) where sufficient material was available (P = 1.4 × 10−8, permutation test). The overlap of ATRX mutations with K27M-H3.3-mutated samples was not significant in either the exome data set (3/9 samples, P = 0.58) or the full set of GBM screened (5/13, P = 0.40) (Fig. 2e).  The histone code—post-translational modifications of specific histone residues—regulates virtually all processes that act on or depend on DNA, including replication and repair, regulation of gene expression, and maintenance of centromeres and telomeres21. Accordingly, although recurrent histone mutations have not previously been reported in cancer, mutations in genes affecting histone post-translational modifications are increasingly described22. H3.3 is a universal, replication-independent histone predominantly incorporated into transcription sites and telomeric regions, and associated with active and open chromatin (reviewed in ref. 23). This role is conserved in the single histone H3 present in yeast, indicating its importance throughout evolution. It functions as a neutral replacement histone, but also participates in the epigenetic transmission of active chromatin states and is associated with chromatin assembly factors in large-scale replication-independent chromatin remodelling events23.  The non-random recurrence of the exact same mutation in different tumours, and the absence of truncating mutations, indicate that H3F3A mutations are most probably gain-of-function events. Lysine 27 is a critical residue of histone 3 and its variants, and methylation at this position (H3K27me), which may be mimicked by the terminal CH3 of methionine substituted at this residue, is commonly associated with transcriptional repression24. In contrast, H3K36 methylation or acetylation typically promotes gene transcription25, 26. Thus, although their morphological phenotype is very similar (K27M and G34R/V mutant tumours are histologically indistinguishable), the two H3.3 variants are expected to act through a different set of genes. This indeed seems to be the case when looking at expression profiles of GBMs harbouring these two mutations. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression from 27 of the WES cohort samples for which sufficient RNA was available revealed a clear separation in the expression of K27M versus G34R/V mutant samples (Supplementary Fig. 3). Further analysis of just those samples harbouring an H3F3A mutation additionally showed a clear distinction in the expression pattern of these two variants (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 7). Among these differentially expressed genes were several linked to brain development that showed a clear mutation-specific expression pattern when comparing both between K27 and G34 mutants and with H3.3 wild-type GBMs, including DLX2, SFRP2, FZD7 and MYT1 (Fig. 3b). We also identified increased levels of H3K36 trimethylation in cells carrying the G34V-H3.3 mutation in one sample for which we had available material (PGBM14) compared to other cells, potentially supporting this hypothesis (Supplementary Fig. 5).  Figure 3: H3F3A mutation variants show distinct expression profiles and are associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres. H3F3A mutation variants show distinct expression profiles and are associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres. a, Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes in 27 of the 48 GBM samples analysed by whole-exome sequencing shows that samples with K27M and G34R/V H3.3 have specific gene expression profiles. Clustering was based on the top 100 genes by standard deviation from autosomal genes detected as present in >10% of samples (see also Supplementary Fig. 3). b, Genes involved in development and differentiation show H3.3 mutation-specific expression patterns. Expression levels of developmental-related genes including DLX2, SFRP2, FZD7 and MYT1 are distinct among H3.3-K27 mutant and H3.3-G34 mutants following gene expression profiling (see also Supplementary Table 7). c, Alternate lengthening of telomere (ALT) is associated with the presence of mutant H3F3A/ATRX in a tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 124 paediatric GBM samples. We assessed ALT using telomere-specific FISH (shown here and in Supplementary Fig. 4) on the paediatric TMA we investigated for ATRX expression (Fig. 2d) and using telomere-specific Southern blotting of high molecular weight genomic DNA (data not shown). Fisher’s exact test was used to identify any association relationship.

We performed telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on the samples with K27M or G34R/V mutations identified by WES for which we had slides available (Supplementary Fig. 4) and on the paediatric GBM TMA (Fig. 3c). These experiments showed that ALT is strongly correlated with ATRX loss (37/47 samples with ALT showed ATRX loss, P < 0.001). However, some samples with nuclear ATRX staining still showed ALT, indicating that additional defects may also account for elongated telomeres in GBM. The presence of ALT was best explained by the simultaneous presence of ATRX/H3F3A/TP53 mutations (P = 0.0002, Fisher’s exact test). Tumours without ATRX/H3F3A/TP53 mutations almost invariably showed shorter telomeres than are observed with ALT, as seen in telomerase-positive gliomas27.  Genetic stability was also assessed through evaluating DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 31 of the 48 tumours using Illumina SNP arrays containing ~2.5 million oligonucleotides (Supplementary Tables 1, 8, 9). Loss of heterozygosity (whole chromosome changes, broad and focal heterozygous deletions, Supplementary Table 9) was common in paediatric GBM samples, as we have previously reported4, and the focal gains and losses we identified in our study showed a high degree of overlap with other published paediatric data sets3, 21. The number of CNAs per tumour was higher in samples with H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 6).  Recurrent point mutations in IDH1 (mainly R132H) are gain of function mutations commonly identified in secondary GBM and the lower-grade tumours from which they develop (86–98% of these astrocytomas), and typically occur in younger adults11, 28. Strikingly, IDH1 and H3F3A mutations were mutually exclusive in our sequencing cohort (P = 1.6 × 10−4). Neomorphic enzyme activity resulting from IDH1 mutation leads to the production of high quantities of the onco-metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG)29. Increased 2-HG inhibits histone demethylases, specifically inducing increased methylation of both H3K27 and H3K3629, 30, the two residues affected directly (K27) or indirectly (K36) by the mutations in H3F3A uncovered in this study. Furthermore, overlap of H3F3A and TP53 mutations in children with GBM (all of the G34R/V and 82% of K27M mutants also harbour TP53 mutations) mirrors the large overlap of IDH1 mutations with TP53 mutations in the proneural adult GBM sub-group18. Thus, mutations which directly (H3F3A), or indirectly (IDH1) affect the methylation of H3.3 K27 or H3.3 K36, in combination with TP53 mutations, characterize the pathogenesis of paediatric and young adult GBM.  Our data indicate a central role of H3.3/ATRX-DAXX perturbation in paediatric GBM. Mutant H3.3 recruitment would occur across the genome and induce abnormal patterns of chromatin remodelling to yield distinct gene expression profiles for the K27 and G34 mutations. Additional loss of ATRX may act to reduce H3.3 incorporation at a subset of genes important in oncogenesis, preventing mutant H3.3 from altering their transcription. ATRX loss will also impair H3.3 loading at telomeres and disrupt their heterochromatic state, facilitating alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Our findings provide an intriguing example of the interplay of genetic and epigenetic events in driving cancer, indicate a new mechanism through which these epigenetic alterations are brought about (mutation of key residues in a regulatory histone), and provide a rationale for targeting the chromatin remodelling machinery in this deadly paediatric cancer.  Methods Main• Methods• References• Acknowledgements• Author information• Supplementary information Sample characteristics and pathological review All samples were obtained with informed consent after approval of the Institutional Review Board of the respective hospitals they were treated in and were independently reviewed by senior paediatric neuropathologists (S.A., A.K.) according to the WHO guidelines. Forty-eight paediatric grade IV astrocytomas (glioblastoma GBM) patients between the age of 3 and 20 years were included in the study. Clinical characteristics of patients are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Samples were taken at the time of the first surgery, before further treatment as needed. Tissues were obtained from the London/Ontario Tumour Bank of the Pediatric Cooperative Health Tissue Network, the Montreal Children’s Hospital and from collaborators in Hungary and Germany. Seven hundred and eighty-four glioma samples from all grades and histological diagnoses across the entire age range in this study were obtained from collaborators across Europe and North America.  Alignment and variant calling for whole-exome sequencing We followed standard manufacturer protocols to perform target capture with the Illumina TruSeq exome enrichment kit and sequencing of 100 bp paired end reads on Illumina HiSeq. We generated approximately 10 Gb of sequence for each subject such that >90% of the coding bases of the exome defined by the consensus coding sequence (CCDS) project were covered by at least 10 reads. We removed adaptor sequences and quality trimmed reads using the Fastx toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) and then used a custom script to ensure that only read pairs with both mates present were subsequently used. Reads were aligned to hg19 with BWA31, and duplicate reads were marked using Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) and excluded from downstream analyses. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions and deletions (indels) were called using samtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) pileup and varFilter32 with the base alignment quality (BAQ) adjustment disabled, and were then quality filtered to require at least 20% of reads supporting the variant call. Variants were annotated using both ANNOVAR33 and custom scripts to identify whether they affected protein coding sequence, and whether they had previously been seen in dbSNP131, the 1000 Genomes data set (October 2011), or in approximately 160 exomes previously sequenced at our centre.  Somatic mutation identification for whole-exome sequencing A variant called in a tumour was considered to be a candidate somatic mutation if the matched normal sample had at least 10 reads covering this position and had zero variant reads, and the variant was not reported in dbSNP131 or the 1000 Genomes data set (October 2011). For the resulting 117 candidate somatic mutations, we manually examined the alignment of each to check for sequencing artefacts and alignment errors. Fifteen variants were easily identified as sequence-specific error artefacts commonly seen shortly downstream of GGC sequences on Illumina sequencers34. Once genes of interest were identified (H3F3A, ATRX, DAXX, TP53, NF1), we examined positions in these genes in the 34 tumour samples where less than 20% of the reads supported the variant. This identified only two additional variants, both in sample PGBM19 where there were low read counts for frameshift insertions in both ATRX (6/32 reads) and DAXX (8/47 reads).  Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of paediatric GBM and TMA (4 µm) were immunohistochemically stained for ATRX and DAXX proteins. Unstained sections were subjected to antigen retrieval in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min at sub-boiling temperatures. Individual slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-ATRX (1:750 dilution, Sigma, catalogue no. HPA001906) or rabbit anti-DAXX (1:100 dilution, Sigma, catalogue no. HPA008736) antibodies. After incubation with the primary antibody, secondary biotin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson) were applied for 30 min. After washing with PBS, slides were developed with diaminobenzidine (Dako) as the chromogen. All slides were counterstained using Harris haematoxylin. The criterion for positive staining was described previously20. Immunohistochemistry staining on TMA was scored by three individuals independently, including a pathologist. To test the level of mono-, di- and trimethylated H3 at position K36, cell lysates from tumour cells were analysed by western blot. Antibodies against H3K36me3 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab9050), H3K36me2 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab9049), H3K36me1 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab9048) and H3.3 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab97968) were used, with conditions suggested by the manufacturer.  Gene expression profiling Total RNA from frozen samples was hybridized to Affymetrix-HG-U133 plus 2.0 gene chips (Affymetrix). Array quality assurance was determined using β-actin and GAPDH 3′/5′ ratio, as recommended by the manufacturer.  Genome-wide SNP array DNA from 31 of the 48 paediatric GBM tumours analysed by whole-exome sequencing was hybridized to Illumina Human Omni 2.5M Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) arrays, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Copy number alterations were analysed using Illumina GenomeStudio Data Analysis Software (Illumina) as previously described35. Statistical analysis of Fisher’s exact test was performed using GraphPad Prism software.  Telomere specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Telomere-specific FISH was done using a standard formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FISH protocol (as described in ref. 20), using a FITC peptide nucleic acid telomere probe from Dako.  
308||The DNA entry and exit points on the nucleosome core regulate the initial invasion of the nucleosome by factors requiring access to the underlying DNA. Here we describe in vivo consequences of eliminating a single protein–DNA interaction at this position through mutagenesis of histone H3 Lys 42 to alanine. This substitution has a dramatic effect on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome in both the transcriptional output and landscape of mRNA species produced. We attribute this in part to decreased histone H3 occupancy at transcriptionally active loci, leading to enhanced elongation. Additionally we show that this lysine is methylated in vivo, and genetic studies of methyl-lysine mimics suggest that this modification may be crucial in attenuating gene expression. Interestingly, this site of methylation is unique to Ascomycota, suggesting a recent evolutionary innovation that highlights the evolvability of post-translational modifications of chromatin.  Keywords: evolution, histone methylation, transcription elongation, transcriptional output, yeast Nucleosomes, the octameric histone protein complex wrapped by 147 base pairs (bp) of DNA, are core components of chromatin in eukaryotes. At a molecular level, the nucleosome crystal structure shows that there are 14 DNA–histone interactions within the core particle, positioned at each minor groove (Luger et al. 1997). Twelve of these interactions are mediated by histone fold motifs of all four histone proteins, and the remaining two involve residues in the histone H3 αN helix at the DNA entry and exit points. Although the majority of these interactions are mediated by nonspecific electrostatics between the DNA and protein backbones, important positively charged histone side chains have also been shown to play a role (Luger and Richmond 1998). Recently, it has been shown in vitro that not all histone–DNA interactions within the nucleosome are of equal strength. Using an optical trapping method, Hall et al. (2009) mapped the strongest interactions to three precise locations on the nucleosome core, including the dyad axis, and ±40 bp on either side of this.  The different classes of intranucleosomal interactions illustrate how the cell can tune the stability of the nucleosome by reinforcing or destabilizing these interactions, thus controlling the timing and extent of accessibility of the underlying DNA. Various proteins and complexes are recruited to chromatin to alter nucleosome stability either temporally or spatially throughout the genome, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, histone variant proteins, and enzymes that chemically modify histone amino acid side chains. (for review, see Hartzog er al. 2002; Li et al. 2007; Clapier and Cairns 2009). The question then arises as to which structurally important interactions defining nucleosome stability at a molecular level are targeted by these processes.  First, it is known that modification of histone residues is quite complex. Modification of residues lying both at the N termini of histone proteins and within the globular core perturbs the formation of higher-order chromatin structure by influencing electrostatic interactions, and through interactions with specific information “readers” (Watanabe et al. 2010). Second, it has been suggested that the residues at the dyad axis are targeted by chromatin remodeling enzymes, because introducing histone mutations in this region (so-called “SIN alleles”) facilitated transcription of genes that typically require chromatin remodeling in the absence of the ATP-dependent factors (Kruger et al. 1995; Recht and Osley 1999) and lead to nucleosome instability in vitro (Kurumizaka and Wolffe 1997). Furthermore, residues at/close to the dyad axis in the nucleosome do not tolerate mutagenesis well, as these positions are overrepresented in collections of lethal histone mutations (Dai et al. 2008; Nakanishi et al. 2008). Third, it has been shown that certain mutations in histone H3 resulted in the formation of spurious transcription from intragenic locations (Cheung et al. 2008), suggesting that the role of the wild-type residue may be to prevent nucleosome destabilization at the 3′ end of ORFs. These residues are located close to the dyad axis as well as at the base of the histone H3 αN helix.  In this study, we sought to understand the contribution of the DNA entry and exit points to nucleosome function in vivo and ascertain whether it plays a dynamic role in controlling the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA. In the crystal structure, the DNA at this region is organized exclusively by the histone H3 αN helix, and a single residue, Lys 42, within this helix interacts directly with DNA by inserting its side chain between the two DNA gyres. In spite of the fact that it has been shown that this interaction is comparatively weak within the nucleosome (Hall et al. 2009), we know from in vitro studies that mutating this residue makes purified nucleosomes inherently more mobile (Somers and Owen-Hughes 2009). We studied the H3-K42A mutation, and, although not a lethal substitution in vivo, yeast cells harboring this histone mutant as the sole source of histone H3 grow slowly and display a variety of phenotypes. The most striking observation is vastly increased transcriptional output of H3-K42A-expressing cells. Surprisingly, this residue is a substrate for methylation, and our data support a role for this modification in transcriptional repression. We therefore identified a critical interaction within the nucleosome that is targeted to fine-tune gene expression, and we propose that K42, and possibly its modification, serves as a structural “gatekeeper” of transcription. Remarkably, K42 is a “young” lysine evolutionarily; in most other eukaryotes, this residue is an arginine, suggesting recent evolution of its thus-far unidentified methylation machinery.  Go to: Results Histone H3-K42A mutants are pleiotropic in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Histone H3-K42 is a crucial residue that mediates the sole DNA contact of the nucleosome at the DNA entry and exit positions. (Fig. 1A). In the crystal structure (White et al. 2001), the K42 side chain is positioned in the solvent-exposed space between the two DNA helices. Its ɛ amino group points away from the nucleosome core and forms two hydrogen bonds with the phosphodiester backbone (Fig. 1B). To assess the contribution of these interactions to nucleosome function, we mutated this lysine residue to alanine, eliminating hydrogen bond potential (Fig. 1C), and performed phenotypic analyses.  Figure 1. Figure 1. Histone H3-K42A is a pleiotropic mutation, which disrupts a structurally important nucleosome surface. (A) The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae nucleosome highlighting histone H3 Lys 42 (orange) positioned at the DNA entry and exit points. The figure ... H3-K42A cells grow almost twice as slowly as wild-type yeast (data not shown). We scored the viability of this mutant under different conditions and found it was sensitive to (1) the DNA-damaging agents hydroxyurea (HU) and methyl-methanesulfonate; (2) benomyl, the microtubule-destabilizing drug; (3) 6-azauracil (6AU), a drug that interferes with transcription; and (4) temperatures >39°C (Fig. 1D). It did not display growth defects in the presence of camptothecin, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, or cold temperatures (data not shown). The pleiotropic behavior of H3-K42A indicates that this residue either is directly critical for numerous cellular processes, or its affect on nucleosome structure indirectly influences multiple pathways, possibly by influencing target gene expression. To test this, we analyzed the transcript profile of cells harboring H3-K42A. Strikingly, in these cells, we found that the expression of ∼42% of genes was altered in comparison with wild-type cells, with the majority of these (90%) up-regulated (Fig. 1E). The average fold increase for affected genes was two; the expression of a subset of loci was altered up to 12-fold above wild-type levels. No specific gene classes (based on Gene Ontology [GO] terms) were preferentially perturbed by histone H3-K42A (Supplemental Fig. S1). Additionally, no correlation was observed between chromosome location and transcriptional response to the H3-K42A substitution (data not shown).  We next examined whether these effects were specific to K42A or whether mutating other residues close to this nucleosome location exhibited similar phenotypes. We know that this region is important for faithful mitotic chromosome segregation, serving as a docking site for the recruitment of Sgo1p to pericentromeric regions during mitosis (Luo et al. 2010). This explains why mutations in this region, including K42A, are benomyl-sensitive, which is suppressed by overexpressing SGO1 (data not shown). We found that, although the H3-K42 region mutants do not confer 6AU sensitivity, we did observe increased expression of certain genes in these strains (Supplemental Fig. S2). However, the extent of this effect is nonuniform, and K42A exhibits the most severe transcriptional phenotype. Taken together, these observations highlight the structural importance and functionality of this nucleosome location and suggest that H3-K42 is a key residue within this region in transcriptional regulation.  Histone H3-K42A profoundly alters the S. cerevisiae transcriptome  To probe mechanisms underlying the potential role of this nucleosome surface during transcription, we sought to understand the hypertranscription phenotype of H3-K42A. The microarray analysis indicated that H3-K42A does not lead to erroneous derepression of transcription genome-wide, as the majority of genes typically repressed under the conditions tested were unaffected by H3-K42A. Therefore, we hypothesized that H3-K42A influences an active transcription cycle, and thus analyzed the dynamic expression of a single inducible locus: MET16. Our results indicate that the initial appearance of MET16 mRNA under inducing conditions was unaltered in H3-K42A cells, suggesting that regulation of the first round of transcription initiation is unaffected. However, MET16 transcript overaccumulates with time in the mutant cells (Fig. 2A), consistent with a defect in establishing a proper set point for transcription rate or inefficient transcription termination (Fig. 2A). MET16 expression level is not affected under repressive conditions, supporting the hypothesis that the effect of K42A depends on transcriptional activation (Fig. 2A).  Figure 2. Figure 2. Histone H3-K42A alters the S. cerevisiae transcriptome. (A) Kinetics of appearance of MET16 mRNA in cells expressing wild-type (WT) or K42A histone H3, as described in the Materials and Methods. Error bars represent the standard deviation between two ... To gain a higher resolution of the hypertranscription phenotype, we examined the length of RNA species produced in K42A cells transcriptome-wide. We hybridized total RNA extracted from mutant cells to the Affymetrix genomic tiling array, which interrogates the yeast genome at 5-bp resolution. A methodology was employed that identifies stretches of RNA that extend beyond the length of wild-type transcripts as well as differential RNA lengths within an ORF (Poorey et al. 2010). Strikingly, we found that ∼30% of all transcripts analyzed deviated from their expected length in H3-K42A cells (Supplemental Table S1). The majority (61%) of these transcripts also displayed increased abundance in the K42A microarray data set. The distribution of actual base pair length change was broad, ranging from 101 bp to 19,196 bp (median = 902 bp). Altered-length transcripts are categorized relative to the ORF of the affected locus as 5′ extensions, 5′ truncations, 3′ truncations, and 3′ extensions. Figure 2B shows that the K42A data set was significantly enriched for both 5′ and 3′ extensions, although truncation events were also detected. Significant overlap was seen between the 5′ and 3′ extension events, indicating that both events occur at the same locus with high frequency in K42A cells (Fig. 2C). A representative example of a transcript length change is shown in Figure 2D for YBR040W, a gene up-regulated 12-fold by H3-K42A. At this single locus, the transcript in K42A cells displayed both 5′ and 3′ extensions. This analysis indicates that H3-K42A drastically alters not only the amplitude, but also the “quality” of the yeast transcriptome.  Hypertranscription phenotype depends on elongation factors  Chromatin negatively impacts many aspects of transcription, and a wide variety of complex mechanisms exist to overcome this obstacle. Based on our analysis of MET16 expression, we hypothesized that histone H3-K42A influences the function of one or more such protein(s) in an event downstream from transcription initiation. We studied transcription component knockouts to probe how K42A elicits its transcriptional effects. We chose 20 nonessential gene mutants known to play roles in the initiation and elongation phases and initially scored their ability to influence K42A 6AU sensitivity. Our results indicate that the K42A 6AU phenotype was specifically suppressed by the deletion of the elongation factors SET2, ELC1, or RCO1 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, we found no genetic interactions between K42A and a series of genes involved primarily in transcription initiation, such as SET1, GCN5, GAL11, and BRE1 (data not shown). Table 1 lists all of the genes tested in this analysis.  Table 1. Table 1. Suppression analysis of histone H3-K42A through perturbations of transcription-related complexes Figure 3. Figure 3. Histone H3-K42 is an important residue during transcription elongation. (A) Strains with the indicated genotypes were plated as described in the Materials and Methods to detect transcriptional elongation defects. (B) Quantitative RT–PCR analysis ... As certain elongation factor deletions are themselves sensitive to 6AU—such as dst1Δ and paf1Δ, for example—we sought additional evidence for the ability of elongation factors to suppress K42A-mediated hypertranscription. We employed quantitative RT–PCR to monitor the expression of three specific loci up-regulated by H3-K42A: YBR040W, YNR062C, and YKL221W. We found that deletions of SET2, DST1, RCO1, or PAF1 completely reversed the ability of H3-K42A to increase transcription of these genes (Fig. 3B). These interactions are consistent with the idea that K42A hypertranscription reflects hyperelongation. If we explain the 6AU sensitivity of K42A as the inability of these cells to generate essential transcripts when nucleotide pools are decreased, perhaps a direct consequence of the extent of genome-wide hypertranscription, then mutations that decrease elongation rates will allow those nucleotides to be used more effectively and restore growth in the presence of 6AU. In contrast, although elc1Δ suppressed the 6AU phenotype of K42A, this strain did not alter the expression pattern of the three test genes. It was also noted that ubp8Δ, a gene involved in the transition between transcription initiation and elongation, had a slight but reproducible suppressive effect in both assays tested (Fig. 3B; data not shown).  Since SET2 is the histone methyltransferase for H3-K36, a residue in close proximity to H3-K42, we tested whether substitutions at H3-K36 would also suppress K42A and found that H3-K36A suppressed K42A slow growth and hypertranscription phenotypes as well as its 6AU sensitivity both in cis and in trans (Fig. 3A; data not shown).  These genetic data show a striking pattern: The H3-K42A phenotypes are specifically suppressed by a subset of elongation factor mutants, suggesting that the mode of action of this allele may be to induce hyperelongation or uncontrolled elongation. The altered elongation rate might in turn explain the altered 3′ end formation observed in >1000 different genes. To test this hypothesis, we determined the levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) actively involved in elongation as opposed to initiation by analyzing the phosphorylation status of its C-terminal domain (CTD). Ser 2 phosphorylation of the CTD is a hallmark of the elongating RNAPII; immunoblot analysis indicated that the levels of this modification were increased in K42A-expressing cells compared with the wild type. In contrast, CTD phosphorylation at Ser 5 is important during transcription initiation; K42A did not affect this modification significantly (Fig. 3C).  Histone H3-K42A alters chromatin structure at actively transcribed genes  Data presented thus far suggest a potential role for H3-K42 in negatively regulating transcription elongation and support the removal of this inhibitory effect by the K42A substitution. Given that nucleosomes harboring a mutation at this site display increased mobility in vitro, we hypothesized that the K42A phenotype may be due to a direct effect on chromatin structure. Figure 2A shows that H3-K42A increases the levels of MET16 expression under inducing conditions specifically, indicating that activated transcription is necessary to reveal the K42A phenotype. Therefore, we hypothesized that K42A-containing nucleosomes give rise to an altered chromatin template that is more permissive to transcription once initiated. We determined the occupancy of histone H3 at genes up-regulated by the H3-K42A mutation by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), as a decrease in nucleosome density across a gene would promote transcription. Additionally, the generation of 5′ truncated transcripts, as seen in K42A cells, has been accounted for previously by the lack of restoration of a repressive chromatin state in the wake of RNAPII elongation (Carrozza et al. 2005; Joshi and Struhl 2005; Keogh et al. 2005). Figure 3D indicates that there is a significant loss of histone H3 at these loci in K42A cells. Interestingly, in two out of the three genes tested, this difference was evident only at the 3′ end of the ORF. There was no detectable difference in H3 occupancy at genes that are unresponsive to K42A; namely, ACT1, inactivated MET16, and an intergenic noncoding locus in K42A cells (data not shown).  During transcription, nucleosomes are continuously disassembled and reassembled by histone chaperones to facilitate the passage of RNAPII along a gene while maintaining a closed state to prevent aberrant initiation (Schwabish and Struhl 2004; Kulaeva et al. 2007). Spt6p is an essential histone chaperone that binds histone H3 and is important for replacing histone H3/H4 tetramers behind RNAPII. Cells expressing a temperature-sensitive (ts) allele of SPT6, spt6-1004, display phenotypes very similar to that of H3-K42A at semipermissive conditions with respect to transcription up-regulation, decreased nucleosome density in gene coding regions, intragenic transcription, and temperature sensitivity (Kaplan et al. 2003; Cheung et al. 2008). Based on these similarities, we hypothesized that the phenotypes associated with K42A result from defects in the SPT6 pathway, and, accordingly, we expected no exacerbation of the common phenotypes when both alleles are combined. We integrated the spt6-1004 allele into our histone knockout strain background and observed no enhancement of spt6-1004 temperature sensitivity by H3-K42A. Furthermore, mRNA length changes in spt6-1004 cells were not altered in the presence of K42A and at either permissive or semipermissive temperatures (Supplemental Fig. S4).  Histone H3-K42 is dimethylated in S. cerevisiae.  During the course of this work, our ongoing proteomic effort to identify novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the globular core of nucleosomes revealed, to our surprise, that histone H3-K42 can be methylated in yeast. We detected both monomethyl and dimethyl forms of K42 using electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in three independent samples (Fig. 4A).  Figure 4. Figure 4. Histone H3-K42 is dimethylated in S. cerevisiae. (A) Electrospray tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS) of the doubly charged dimethylated peptide: YK(dimet.)PGTVALR, m/z 516.869, recorded using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer in an LC-MS/MS experiment ... Residue 42 is an arginine in all other eukaryotes except Ascomycota (Supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that, if this lysine is indeed modified, the methylation machinery must be newly evolved. With considerable skepticism, we raised an antibody against a K42 dimethyl-containing peptide. With such an antiserum in hand, experiments to probe for this modification in S. cerevisiae by an independent method became possible. The dot blot in Figure 4B indicates the specificity of this antibody in recognizing the dimethyl-modified histone peptide over the unmodified using competition assays with specific and control unmodified peptides. Immunoblot analyses (Fig. 4C) supported the specificity of the antibody and the existence in vivo of dimethylation of H3-K42 (H3-K42me2). These data illustrate that the serum detects its antigen in both purified histones and whole-cell protein extracts from yeast expressing wild-type histone H3, but fails to detect histone H3 from strains harboring mutations at residue 42 or unmodified bacterially expressed yeast histone H3. Additionally, the modified band in the immunoblot could be competed away by addition of either a monomethyl or dimethylated histone peptide, but not trimethyl or unmodified control peptides.  Histone H3-K42 methylation is enriched at the 5′ end of genes  In our efforts to characterize histone H3-K42me2, we undertook ChIP-on-chip analysis using the methyl-specific antibody to probe for the localization of this modification across the yeast genome. Histone H3-K42 dimethylation was significantly enriched at 491 genome locations distributed seemingly randomly across all 16 S. cerevisiae chromosomes (at a false discovery rate [FDR] threshold of <0.1). The modification was enriched in intragenic regions (65%); however, a substantial proportion was also located in intergenic regions (35%). Figure 4D shows the distribution of H3-K42me2 averaged genome-wide across all genes, indicating enrichment in the 5′ half of genes.  Establishing a genetic system to probe the possible function of histone H3-K42me2  We next sought in vivo evidence for the functionality of this modification in yeast. The H3-K42A mutation eliminates this modification in cells, and therefore the phenotypes associated with this substitution give us some insight into the effects of losing H3-K42me2. However, alanine is not a conservative substitution and, as stated previously, in addition to preventing K42 methylation, it also eliminates potential K42 hydrogen bonding with DNA. We therefore mutated K42 to arginine to mimic a constitutively nonmethylated form of K42 while maintaining hydrogen-bonding potential. Unfortunately, this allele displayed no detectable phenotypes in any assay tested (Fig. 5A; data not shown). We rationalized that perhaps arginine can act a substrate for methylation at this site, supported by the presence of arginine at this position in all other eukaryotes. However, we were unsuccessful in detecting methylation at this site in cells by mass spectrometry. Therefore, we chose to use K42Q as a surrogate for a demethylated version of K42, as it cannot be methylated but is predicted to retain the H bond to DNA (Supplemental Fig. S6).  Figure 5. Figure 5. Histone H3-K42me2 may play a role in transcription. (A) Strains expressing the indicated histone H3 allele were assayed for their sensitivity to 6AU to detect transcription elongation defects. ppr1Δ acts as a positive control for comparison. ( ... A complementary approach that is widely used to determine the contribution of a PTM in vivo is to generate a mutation at the site that mimics a constitutively modified state. The closest natural mimics to a methylated lysine are leucine and methionine, which represent monomethyl and dimethyl side chains, respectively. Structures of nucleosomes predicted by energy minimization (Guex and Peitsch 1997) harboring these substitutions are illustrated in Supplemental Figure S6. Although the length of the side chains of the substituted amino acids do not extend as far as lysine, their solvent exposure seems unaltered, and it could be argued that the recognition of their functional groups is similar to that of the modified and unmodified native residues. In particular, the solvent-exposed side chain terminal dimethyl of leucine has a contour strikingly similar to that of dimethyl lysine.  Histone H3-K42me2 may regulate transcription  We generated strains that expressed either H3-K42Q, H3-K42L, or H3-K42M as their sole source of histone H3 and monitored their phenotypes. Initially we determined each strains' sensitivity to 6AU, and Figure 5A shows that our data are consistent with the modification status dictating the sensitivity to this drug. Cells expressing the unmodified mimic K42Q behaved like K42A and were sensitive to the drug, whereas cells expressing the modified mimics K42L and K42M were unaffected by 6AU.  To ask whether the effect of K42A on transcription might be related to H3-K42 modification state, we analyzed K42Q and K42L transcript profiles. Histone H3-K42Q altered expression of ∼25% of the genome and, as in K42A-expressing cells, the majority (∼77%) of these genes were up-regulated. K42L, however, had a more modest phenotype, resulting in dysregulation of only 7% of the genome. Strikingly, however, the major effect of K42L was to down-regulate gene expression (Table 2). We next determined the number and identity of target genes common to the three profiling experiments (Fig. 5B). There was high concordance between genes affected by both K42A and K42Q and the direction of change in expression of these genes. One-hundred-thirty-five genes were affected by all three alleles: K42A, K42Q, and K42L. Whereas the direction of change in these genes was concordant in K42A and K42Q, ∼40% of the genes were oppositely regulated by K42L. Additionally, almost all genes common to the K42A and K42L data sets were differentially regulated by each mutation. Collectively, these data support a model in which K42 methylation is a repressive mark for transcription.  Table 2. Table 2. Summary of microarray analysis of the indicated histone H3-K42 mutants A more direct test of this model is to compare the loci that are enriched by K42 methylation, as determined by our ChIP-on-chip experiment, and those genes whose expression was dysregulated by K42 alleles. Consistent with K42 methylation acting to inhibit transcription, we found significant overlap between genomic regions containing this modification and the loci up-regulated by both K42A (P-value = 1.6 × 10−4) and K42Q (P-value = 3.1 × 10−6) substitutions, both of which mimic a lack of K42me2. Consistently, the relatively few genes that showed decreased expression in the presence of K42A or K42Q did not show significant enrichment of H3-K42me2, consistent with these representing secondary effects. Furthermore, we found that loci down-regulated by the constitutively methylated mimic K42L were significantly enriched for nucleosomes containing H3-K42me2 (P-value = 1.3 × 10−4).  Given our knowledge that H3-K42A causes mRNA length changes, we asked whether other K42 alleles displayed a similar effect. Specifically, we determined the ability of K42 mutations to initiate transcription at a site downstream from the natural start site. We used a reporter in which the HIS3 ORF was driven by the intragenic cryptic promoter in the FLO8 gene (Fig. 5C; Cheung et al. 2008) and assayed the ability of K42 mutants to grow in the absence of histidine. Our results indicate that, similar to K42A, the demethylated H3-K42 mimic K42Q was capable of inducing cryptic promoter–HIS3 expression, whereas K42L, the constitutively methylated mimic, was not—consistent with a potential role for H3-K42me2 in preventing erroneous transcription (Fig. 5C).  Components of the PAF1 complex influence histone H3-K42 dimethylation  The transcript-profiling studies of the different K42 alleles suggested that methylation of this site may be important in the regulation of transcription, and our genetic investigations into the K42A allele implied a role for the modification during transcription elongation. To directly test this hypothesis, we determined whether strains with defects in transcription elongation might signal through H3-K42me2 and perturb the abundance of this modification. We quantified the levels of H3-K42me2 in 87 deletion strains that either lacked a known nonessential transcription elongation factor or were known to be sensitive to 6AU (Supplemental Table S2). Strikingly, the only strains that showed any effect on the levels of H3-K42me2 were those lacking a component of the PAF1 elongation complex. ctr9Δ and hpr1Δ showed statistically significant decreases in H3-K42me2 and rtf1Δ displayed a modest defect in this modification. ccr4Δ, paf1Δ, and spt13Δ displayed elevated levels (up to threefold that of wild type) of this methyl mark (Fig. 5D).  Go to: Discussion Comprehensive histone mutagenesis in yeast has shown that the DNA entry/exit point of the nucleosome does not tolerate substitutions. We identified a group of histone H3 residues in this location that influence transcription, the most critical among them being Lys 42. We showed that the integrity of K42 is essential to maintain the correct transcriptional output in a yeast cell, potentially explaining why certain mutations at this site are pleiotropic. This is a novel site of methylation in yeast: We used a K42-methyl-specific antibody in conjunction with a genetic approach to probe the function and biological significance of this modification. Given its nucleosomal location and the results of our studies, we believe that K42, and possibly its methylation, acts as a transcriptional “gatekeeper” by limiting access to nucleosomal DNA during transcriptional elongation.  The histone H3-K42A substitution results in the abundance of many transcripts, as well as substantial effects on the lengths of many mRNAs. Considering how the elongating RNAPII is influenced by many negative factors, not least the chromatin template, and that it is not uncommon for this massive complex to halt, stall, or become completely arrested (for review, see Shilatifard 2004), we believe that chromatin containing K42A is intrinsically less restrictive to the elongating RNAPII protein complex because the “gate is constitutively open,” promoting more efficient elongation. The two most prominent changes in mRNA length that we detected in K42A cells are those that generate 5′ and 3′ extensions, indicating that the effect of K42A-containing nucleosomes extends beyond canonical transcriptional units. The inability of transcription to be terminated may reflect the permissiveness of K42A chromatin to elongating RNAPII. We hypothesize that, once RNAPII is engaged in transcription, the chromatin landscape in K42A cells is sufficient to promote elongation through normal stop signals even in the presence of transcription-terminating factors. In support of this, our data show that, in K42A cells, we detected an increase in elongation-competent RNAPII, as monitored by increased Ser 2 phosphorylation of the CTD. Furthermore, we found that, by deleting positive elongation factors, the hypertranscription phenotype of K42A was suppressed. For example, DST1 is required to re-engage stalled RNAPII (Christie et al. 1994; Kulish, Struhl 2001); by eliminating DST1, we decreased the number of RNAPII complexes that complete transcripts, thereby masking K42A phenotypes. Similar results were seen for mutants of PAF1, an RNAPII-associated protein required to recruit proelongation factors to actively transcribed genes, including Rad6p (Wood et al. 2003), Dot1p (Krogan et al. 2003), and the FACT complex (for review, see Jaehning 2010). Since our tiling array analysis does not assign strand specificity, ambiguity exists when transcripts span multiple loci and, consequently, ∼30% of 5′ extensions could be classified as 3′ extensions of an upstream locus resulting from hyperelongation (Supplemental Fig. S7). Additionally, our data indicate that K42A cells do not induce expression of repressed genes, illustrating that K42A chromatin does not generically promote ectopic recruitment of initiation complexes genome-wide. These data, taken together with the fact that deleting nonessential initiation factors did not alter K42A phenotypes, suggest that aberrant transcription elongation efficiency specifically underlies K42A-mediated transcriptional phenotypes.  What are the mechanisms behind the “open gate” state of nucleosomes in K42A cells? Our ChIP analyses reveal that there is a loss of histone H3 in K42A cells at certain actively transcribed genes, which is more apparent at the 3′ end of the ORF. We also provided genetic evidence suggesting that both K42A and spt6-1004, a Ts− mutation in the histone chaperone Spt6p, feed into the same pathway and are mechanistically similar. This raises the hypothesis that the histone H3-containing K42A mutation may not be redeposited efficiently in the wake of RNAPII elongation. However, this explanation alone is insufficient to account for the greater number of transcripts affected by K42A cells than in spt6-1004. We speculate that the permissiveness of elongation in K42A cells may arise from inefficient redeposition of histone H3 in conjunction with increased mobility of K42A nucleosomes, as evidenced in vitro.  Our discovery that H3-K42 is methylated in yeast corroborates the importance of this nucleosome residue, providing us with a mechanism by which a cell regulates this transcriptional gatekeeper. The contrasting transcript profiles of methyl (K42L) and nonmethyl (K42Q) mimics of K42 provide indirect evidence to support such a mechanism. Furthermore, we saw a direct effect on methylation levels in mutants with a defective Paf1 complex. This suggests that perturbations to elongation, specifically through the Paf1 complex pathway, influence K42me2 abundance, placing this modification in the Paf1 pathway. The exact mechanism underlying the pattern of H3-K42me2 variations in the individual Paf1 complex subunit deletions is likely to be complex, although it is attractive to speculate that the Paf1 complex is necessary for the recruitment of the elusive K42-specific methyltransferase. In support of this notion, deletion of PAF1 leads to both initiation of transcription at intragenic cryptic promoters (Chu et al. 2007) and 3′ extensions of certain mRNAs (Penheiter et al. 2005; Sheldon et al. 2005), similar to H3-K42A.  Residue 42 in histone H3 is arginine in most other braches of eukaryotes, including Basidiomycetes (Supplemental Fig. S6), indicating that the lysine substitution appeared within the last 400 million years, after Ascomycota and Basidiomycota diverged. Therefore, H3-K42me2 is not a conserved modification, and, strikingly, the ability to methylate this residue is a very recent innovation in evolution, possibly through neo- or subfunctionalization of a conserved enzyme. To explore what protein might have evolved such a function, we searched for a K42-specific methyltransferase in yeast. Unfortunately, to date, our efforts have proved futile, as individual deletion of all 62 known annotated methyltransferases in yeast, including all SET domain proteins and Dot1p, failed to abolish H3-K42me2, as detected by immunoblotting (data not shown). From this analysis, we assume that Ascomycetes have co-opted a noncanonical methyltransferase to methylate H3-K42, or, alternatively, redundant enzymes may modify K42.  Although the prevalence of K42me2 histones throughout the genome is limited, as illustrated by our ChIP-on-chip data, this might indicate that there was a selective advantage to yeast in acquiring this novel modification at those particular sites. It is attractive to interpret the K42A and K42Q mutant data as reflecting the loss of H3-K42me2, and that the ability of the cell to regulate the transcriptional output may be the selective pressure driving the evolution of the modification. In support of this idea, there is a correlation between genes affected by nonmethyl mimics K42A and K42Q and those enriched with the modification. Additionally, these alleles permit the production of intragenic transcripts, whereas the methyl-mimic K42L suppresses it. Although it has been shown that additional nucleosome core mutations promote intragenic transcription, our study illustrates how this phenomenon may be regulated within the cell by PTM. One tempting model might be that H3-K43me2 regulates the interaction between Spt6p and histone H3.  To uncover alternative sources of selective pressure promoting histone H3-K42me2 evolution, we took a bioinformatic approach and looked for differences in specific chromatin-related proteins between the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, the latter lacking H3-K42. One potentially relevant candidate is the linker histone, H1, which binds DNA at the nucleosome entry and exit points (Thoma et al. 1979), stabilizing the nucleosome and restricting transcription in most eukaryotes. However, S. cerevisiae and other Ascomycetes species lack a canonical H1 protein. Given that histone H3-K42 is positioned in the same nucleosomal region, and our data suggest a role for H3-K42me in transcriptional inhibition, it is plausible that Ascomycota have evolved this modification to serve the function of canonical histone H1. In support of this, our sequence analysis showed that histone H1 divergence largely conforms to phylogeny; H1 sequences from different Basidiomycetes species are more similar than those from Ascomycetes. Similarly, we found that the fungal distribution of a second protein, HP-1, and, presumably, the histone H3-K9 methylation system that generates the repressive chromatin mark that it recognizes follow a similar pattern. Interestingly, in this example, Ascomycetes species lack any detectable homolog of HP-1. These preliminary findings suggest that the lack of canonical histone H1 and/or H3-K9 methylation in Ascomycota could have driven the evolution of a novel repressive chromatin mark, H3-K42me2. Future experiments will be required to directly test this hypothesis.  If we assume that the lack of conservation of this site among higher eukaryotes implies that K42 methylation is a recent acquisition of Ascomycota, we conclude that its function in attenuating transcriptional output provides an evolutionary advantage to these species. We know that, under certain growth conditions, wild-type yeast actively produce cryptic transcripts that play physiological roles (Ono et al. 2005; Bickel and Morris 2006), and that certain intragenic transcripts can be translated into functional proteins, increasing the complexity of the yeast proteome, perhaps providing the cell with additional capabilities and functions. Given that up to 17% of genes within the yeast genome contain intragenic cryptic initiation sites, regulatory mechanisms must be in place to modulate the extent of this form of pervasive transcription, perhaps limiting it temporally or under certain conditions. Methylation of the gate to the globular core of the nucleosome at histone H3-K42 is one such mechanism.  Go to: Materials and methods Strains and media  Standard laboratory techniques for budding yeast manipulations were used. The previously described yeast strain JPY12 (Park et al. 2002) was the parental strain employed for all genetic manipulations unless otherwise noted. A uracil auxotrophy derivative of JPY12, EMHY510, was generated. EMHY510 used in 6AU growth assay was transformed with the URA3 CEN plasmid pRS316. Deletion strains of JPY12 were made using a PCR product amplified from the appropriate BY4742 strain of the KanMX deletion collection. Colony PCR was used to verify the correct integration of the knockout cassette in JPY12. Supplemental Table S3 contains a complete list of strains generated. The Ts− allele of SPT6, spt6-1004, was integrated in EMHY510 by transformation with the SphI-linearized form of the integrating plasmid pCK125 and selecting on synthetic complete (SC)–Ura. Ura+ transformants were streaked to YPD, replica-plated to 5FOA, and subsequently screened for a Ts− phenotype at 39°C. Colony PCR was used to verify the correct targeting of the Ts− alleles.  All media were supplemented with 0.64 mM adenine. SC medium contained 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB, Difco), 2% (w/v) glucose, and 2% (w/v) bacto-agar, supplemented with 2% (w/v) “Hopkins mix” amino acids. HU medium was prepared by supplementing SC with 200 mM HU. Benomyl was added to YPD-rich medium at a concentration of 30 μg/mL. 6AU-containing medium was SC–Ura containing 200 μg/mL 6AU.  Plasmids  Plasmids pDM18 (Park et al. 2002) and pEMH7 (Hyland et al. 2005) carrying HHT2 and HHF2 and pJP11 encoding HHT1 and HHF1 were used in this study. pEMH17 was generated whereby the NaeI/SacI fragment from pEMH7 was excised and subcloned into pRS315. Histone H3 mutants were engineered into pEMH7, as described previously (Hyland et al. 2005). Plasmids were sequenced with oligonucleotides JB6505 and JB6504. Plasmid pBS4 harboring histone H3-K36A mutation was obtained from B. Strahl. The integrating plasmid pCK125 harboring spt6-1004 was provided by F. Winston.  Growth assays  Yeast strains used in growth assays were grown overnight in either YPD or selective medium where appropriate. The next day, cultures were diluted to an OD A600 of 0.5, and fivefold serial dilutions were plated on both growth control plates and experimental plates. Plates were photographed after 2 d of incubation at 30°C.  Intragenic transcript detection  The FLO8 intragenic reporter was generated by V. Cheng and F. Winston. The reporter construct (4.5 kb) was amplified from strain VC-377-1B using primers JB11738 and JB11739, and was used to transform EMHY510 harboring pBS4 (H3-K36A). Transformants were selected on YPD + G418 and were screened by colony PCR for the correct integration, generating strain EMHY578. This strain was transformed with pEMH17 harboring histone alleles, and pBS4 was shuffled. Transformants were patched onto YPD + G418, incubated for 2 d at 30°C, replica-plated to SC–His, and further incubated for 2 d at 30°C. A His+ phenotype in this assay reports inappropriate intragenic transcription initiation.  Transcriptional profiling; data acquisition and normalization  RNA was extracted from log phase cultures of JPY12 strains expressing histone H3-K42 mutations using the acid phenol method. Ten micrograms of total RNA of two replicate samples was used to create labeled cRNA cocktails, as outlined in the Affymetrix protocol. Fifteen micrograms each of labeled cRNA was hybridized on the Affymetrix GeneChip Yeast 2.0 arrays. Data analysis was conducted on the chips' CEL file probe signal values at the Affymetrix probe pair level using the statistical technique Robust Multiarray Analysis (Irizarry et al. 2003) with the bioconductor package Affy. Contrast normalization was carried out as described in Bolstad et al. (2003) using the following control probes: “Bacillus subtilis,” “Bacteriophage,” “Escherichia coli,” “synthetic insert,” and other non-S. cerevisiae “control” probes, excluding all Schizosaccharomyces pombe and S. cerevisiae “control” probes on the microarray. Between-condition and between-replicate variations were examined with pairwise MvA plots, where the base 2 log ratios (M) between two samples are plotted against their averaged base 2 log signals (A). An empirical Bayes method with lognormal–normal modeling, as implemented in the bioconductor package EBarrays, was used to estimate the posterior probabilities of the differential expression of genes between the sample conditions (Kendziorski et al. 2003; Newton et al. 2001). The criterion of a posterior probability >0.5 was used to produce the differentially expressed gene list. Bioconductor packages are found at http://www.bioconductor.org, and all computations were performed under the R environment (http://www.r-project.org). The raw data were deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession number GSE13889.  Real-time quantitative PCR  Strains were grown in rich medium supplemented with 0.64 mM adenine and were harvested at log phase. RNA was prepared from these cells and treated with DNase, and 500 ng of this RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Following RNase H digestion, cDNA equivalent to 25 ng of input RNA was added to a real-time PCR reaction using the Applied Biosystems SYBR Green RT–PCR system. Reactions were run in a 96-well plate using the Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT fast real-time PCR system. The CT values for expression of gene of interest were compared with that of an internal ACT1 control. The primers used for ACT1 amplification were JB9639 and JB9640 for YBR040W; JB10085 and JB10086 for YNR062C; JB10091 and JB10092 for YKL221W; JB10112 and JB10113 for MCD1; and JB12292 and JB12293.  Analysis of dynamic MET16 transcription  Overnight cultures of the indicated strains were diluted 1:20 in rich medium and grown to log phase. Cells were pelleted at room temperature, washed once in water, and added to either SC–Met or SC prewarmed medium, a procedure that took up to 4 min. Aliquots of cells were taken at regular intervals, added to equal volume of ice-cold 100% ethanol, and centrifuged immediately at 4°C. Cell pellets were frozen on dry ice. RNA was extracted from cells and the MET16 transcript was analyzed by quantitative RT–PCR as above using primers JB12026 and JB12027. ACT1 served as the internal control.  Immunoblotting  Whole-cell lysates were prepared from 2.5 A600 units of cells for SDS-PAGE using the alkaline lysis method as described previously (Kushnirov 2000). For histone analyses, lysates were resolved on 4%–20% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies against the C terminus of histone H3 (1:1000 dilution) (Abcam, ab1971), and histone H3-K42me-specific (1:500 dilution) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies against rabbit IgGs (Amersham Pharmacia) and chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). Polyclonal anti-H3-K42me antibodies, generated by Upstate Biotechnologies, were raised in rabbits upon exposure to the H3 peptide PPEMH2, 39-HRYKme2PGTVAL-48. Antibodies were affinity-purified from the rabbit serum using PPEMH2 and eluted at pH 1.7. Peptide competition of Western blots was undertaken by incubating the H3-K42me2-specific antibody with 0.5 μg/mL appropriate peptide (PPEMH1, 39-HRYKPGTVAL-48; PPEMH2, 39-HRYKme2PGTVAL-48; PPEMH3, 39-HRYKmePGTVAL-48; and PPEMH4, 39-HRYKme3PGTVAL-48 ) for 1 h at room temperature prior to probing the blot. Analysis of the phosphorylation state of the C terminus of RNAPII was undertaken as described previously (Patturajan et al. 1998).  Histone H3 ChIP  The protocol employed was described previously (Dedon et al. 1991) using the histone H3 C-terminal antibody (Abcam, ab1971). Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantitated using quantitative RT–PCR as outlined in the preceding section. The following primer pairs were used: JB10085 and JB10086 for 3′ YBR040W, JB12360 and JB12361 for 5′ YBR040W, JB12450 and JB12451 for 5′ YBR284, JB10114 and JB10115 for 3′ YBR284, JB12452 and JB12453 for 5′ YNR062C, and JB12454 and JB12455 for 3′ YNR062C.  mRNA length change detection  RNA was extracted from log phase cultures of JPY12 strains expressing histone H3-K42 mutations using the acid phenol method. The analysis of genomic tiling array data was carried out by methods described in Poorey et al. (2010). TAS (Tiling Analysis software version 1.1) was used to analyze the raw array data to generate graph files containing log2 (fold change) or differential signals. Differential signals were calculated using the Hodges-Leman estimator, which is associated with the Wicoxon rank-sum test, over a sliding window of 500 bp for treatment versus control. We applied a 0.3 cutoff to the absolute value of log2 (fold change)—i.e., the differential signal data—to identify differentially expressed segments. By comparing these segments to annotated 5′ and 3′ ends, we identified RNA length changes in mutants relative to control. These changes were categorized as 5′ extensions, 5′ truncations, 3′ truncations, or 5′ extensions. Putative length changes that did not satisfy certain criteria—including minimum overlap with the annotations, minimum length change, and minimum signal difference—were filtered out (Poorey et al. 2010).  GBM is the most common and also the most devastating brain tumor, with a 5-year survival rate below 10%. We present strong evidence that GBM can be subclassified into multiple groups, indistinguishable by histological appearance, but correlating with molecular-genetic factors as well as key clinical variables such as patient age and tumor location. We identified six epigenetic GBM subgroups displaying characteristic global DNA methylation patterns, harboring distinct hotspot mutations, DNA copy-number alterations, and transcriptomic patterns. These findings may guide the identification of innovative subgroup-specific treatments, e.g., targeted epigenetic therapies for H3.3-mutated variants, and improve the design of future clinical trials. Our study enables classification of GBM across the entire age continuum into biologically meaningful subgroups carrying clinical implications.  Introduction Glioblastoma (GBM; World Health Organization [WHO] grade IV), the most common primary brain tumor, carries a universally dismal prognosis in children and adults (Louis et al., 2007). With evidence emerging recently of age-specific molecular and genetic differences, it is now becoming apparent that pediatric GBM is largely biologically distinct from adult GBM. Based on similarities in recurrent genomic aberrations (Bax et al., 2010; McLendon et al., 2008; Paugh et al., 2010; Qu et al., 2010; Schiffman et al., 2010; Zarghooni et al., 2010), it was long thought that pediatric GBMs more closely resembled adult “secondary” GBM, which arise from a preceding lower-grade lesion. However, stepwise transformation from less-malignant gliomas into GBM rarely occurs in children (Broniscer et al., 2007). Furthermore, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, which are found in up to 98% of adult secondary GBM, are very rare in childhood GBM (<10%) ( Antonelli et al., 2010; Balss et al., 2008; De Carli et al., 2009; Paugh et al., 2010; Pollack et al., 2011; Schiffman et al., 2010; Setty et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2009).  We recently identified two recurrent somatic mutations in the H3F3A gene, affecting highly conserved residues of its encoded protein, the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, in one-third of pediatric GBMs ( Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). Mutations in a protein complex comprised of H3.3 and ATRX/DAXX were detected in 45% of cases, and were shown to be associated with TP53 mutations and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). The H3.3 mutations result in amino acid substitutions at K27 or G34—at or near residues targeted by key post-translational modifications that regulate H3.3’s activity in governing gene expression ( Hyland et al., 2011)—and were shown to be linked to distinct transcriptional profiles (Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). Methylation of K27 and K36 is also disrupted by elevated levels of the onco-metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) resulting from gain-of-function mutations in IDH1 ( Chowdhury et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011), which was previously shown to be associated with a distinct Glioma-CpG-Island Methylator Phenotype (G-CIMP) (Noushmehr et al., 2010).  In the present study, we further investigate the heterogeneity of glioblastoma across the entire age spectrum, and elucidate the impact of H3F3A mutations on the GBM epigenome.  Results Integrated Molecular Classification of Glioblastoma  We used an integrative approach based on epigenetic, copy-number, expression, and genetic analyses to investigate the heterogeneity of glioblastoma across all age groups. An overview of all GBM samples subjected to various analyses is given in Figure S1A available online.  We investigated a cohort of GBMs from children (n = 59) and adult patients (n = 77) for genome-wide DNA methylation patterns using the Illumina 450k methylation array, and complemented our data with unpublished profiles of 74 adult GBM samples generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Consortium (McLendon et al., 2008) (Table S1). Consensus clustering using the 8,000 most variant probes across the data set robustly identified six distinct DNA methylation clusters (Figures 1 and S1B). Based on correlations with mutational status, DNA copy-number aberrations, and gene expression signatures, as outlined below, we have labeled these subgroups “IDH,” “K27,” “G34,” “RTK I (PDGFRA),” “Mesenchymal,” and “RTK II (Classic).”  Methylation Profiling Reveals the Existence of Six Epigenetic GBM ... Figure 1.  Methylation Profiling Reveals the Existence of Six Epigenetic GBM Subgroups Heatmap of methylation levels in six GBM subgroups identified by unsupervised k-means consensus clustering, and control samples as indicated. Each row represents a probe; each column represents a sample. The level of DNA methylation (beta-value) is represented with a color scale as depicted. For each sample (n = 210), patient age, subgroup association, mutational status, and cytogenetic aberrations are indicated. See also Figure S1 and Tables S1 and S2. Figure options A striking finding of this integrated analysis is that H3F3A K27 and G34 mutations were exclusively distributed to the K27 (18/18) and G34 (18/18) clusters, respectively (p < 0.001; Fisher’s exact test) ( Figure 1). The IDH group contained 88% of IDH1-mutated tumors (23/26) (p < 0.001) and displayed concerted, global hypermethylation ( Figures 1, 2A, and 2B), thereby expanding the previously described link between IDH1 mutation and G-CIMP+ tumors to a pediatric setting (Noushmehr et al., 2010). In contrast, tumors in the G34 cluster specifically showed widespread hypomethylation across the whole genome, and especially in nonpromoter regions, when compared with all other subgroups (Figures 2A and 2B). This suggests the existence of a more global version of a CpG hypomethylator phenotype (CHOP), as proposed for a small number of genes in gastric cancer (Kaneda et al., 2002). More detailed mapping of differentially methylated regions revealed that the hypomethylation observed in H3F3A G34-mutated tumors was particularly prominent at chromosome ends ( Figures 2C and 2D), potentially linking subtelomeric demethylation to alternative lengthening of telomeres, which is most frequently observed in this subgroup (Schwartzentruber et al., 2012).

Figure options Of note, all mutations in H3F3A and IDH1 were mutually exclusive (p < 0.001) ( Figure 1). To further test this observation, we extended the targeted sequencing analysis of H3F3A and IDH1 to include 460 GBM samples from patients covering a broad age range ( Figure S1C; Table S2). Even in this expanded series, no co-occurring mutations in H3F3A and IDH1 were detected (p < 0.001), and the age distribution confirmed reported associations of certain mutations with GBM in children (H3F3A K27), adolescent patients (H3F3A G34), and young adult patients (IDH1) ( Khuong-Quang et al., 2012; Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2009) (Figure S1C; Table S2). As we have shown, TP53 mutations largely overlap with H3F3A mutations in pediatric GBM ( Schwartzentruber et al., 2012), similar to the association of TP53 and IDH1 mutations in adults ( Yan et al., 2009). This observation also holds true in our larger cohort, with a high enrichment of TP53 mutations in the G34 (18/18), IDH (22/24), and K27 (13/18) clusters (p < 0.001) ( Figure 1).  Since pediatric GBMs have been shown to display a distinct spectrum of focal copy-number aberrations (CNAs) compared with their adult counterparts (Bax et al., 2010; Paugh et al., 2010; Qu et al., 2010), we integrated DNA methylation clusters with copy-number data derived from the methylation arrays (Figures 1 and S1D). Interestingly, PDGFRA amplification was significantly more common in the RTK I “PDGFRA” cluster than any other subgroup (11/33; p < 0.001), hence our proposed name for this group. The RTK II “Classic” cluster demonstrated a very high frequency of whole chromosome 7 gain (50/56; p < 0.001) and whole chromosome 10 loss (56/56; p < 0.001), as well as frequent homozygous deletion of CDKN2A (35/56; p < 0.001) and amplification of EGFR (39/56; p < 0.001) ( Figures 1 and S1D)—all hallmark CNAs of adult GBM (Louis et al., 2007), as reflected by the complete absence of pediatric patients in this cluster. Overall, tumors from the IDH, K27, and G34 clusters were mostly devoid of the detected CNAs associated with the other GBM subgroups (amplifications of PDGFRA and EGFR, deletion of CDKN2A, chromosome 7 gain, and chromosome 10 loss) ( Figure 1; Table S1), in keeping with a previously reported finding in G-CIMP+ tumors (Noushmehr et al., 2010).  To additionally place the methylation subgroups proposed here into the context of previous GBM classification systems, we used the gene expression signature described by the TCGA to classify 122 of the above tumors with available transcriptome data into one of four gene expression subtypes: Proneural, Neural, Mesenchymal, and Classical (Verhaak et al., 2010) (Figure 1; Table S1). This further confirmed the prototypic nature of tumors in the RTK II “Classic” cluster, which was clearly enriched for “Classical” expression profiles (p < 0.001). The RTK I “PDGFRA” cluster was highly enriched for “Proneural” expression (p = 0.01), further substantiating the previously reported association of PDGFRA amplification with this expression subtype ( Verhaak et al., 2010). As expected, all tumors in the IDH cluster displayed “Proneural” expression patterns. Interestingly, the K27 cluster also showed a clear enrichment of tumors with a “Proneural” signature (p < 0.01), indicating that this expression subtype can be divided into subgroups harboring distinct genomic aberrations based on methylation profiling and targeted gene sequencing. “Mesenchymal” gene expression was mostly restricted to one methylation subgroup (p < 0.001), that showed a much lower incidence of typical GBM-related CNAs, generally fewer copy-number changes, and no characteristic point mutations. We therefore termed this methylation cluster, which displayed the largest similarity with normal brain methylation patterns, “Mesenchymal.” Copy-number aberrations in these samples were, however, observed at a similar amplitude as in other cases, indicating an absence of excess stromal contamination.  Our finding of six GBM methylation clusters is different from a TCGA study using Illumina 27k arrays, which identified three methylation clusters in an adult GBM cohort (Noushmehr et al., 2010). Applying their signature to our data set, however, showed that two clusters (G-CIMP+ and Cluster #3) mapped almost exactly to two of our subgroups (IDH and RTK II “Classic,”, respectively, p < 0.001) (Figure 1). By adding pediatric cases to the study cohort, we demonstrate that TCGA methylation Cluster #2 can be further divided into four biologically distinct subgroups, defined by a clear enrichment for mutations (K27, G34), CNAs (PDGFRA), and/or gene expression signatures (Mesenchymal). The same DNA methylation clusters were apparent when restricting our analyses to the pediatric population, with the exception of the RTK II “Classic” cluster, which is not represented in the pediatric population (Figure S1E). Notably, by analyzing tumors from patients spanning a broad age spectrum, we further observed a clear age-dependent increase in overall DNA methylation levels (Figure S2A), even after adjusting our analysis to exclude tumors with age-related mutations in IDH1 or H3F3A ( Figure S2B).  GBM Subgroups Show Correlations with Clinicopathological Variables  The DNA methylation clusters described here were closely associated with specific age groups, pointing toward the biological diversity of epigenetic GBM subgroups (Figure 1). While the K27 cluster predominantly consisted of childhood patients (median age 10.5 years, range 5–23 years), patients in the G34 cluster were found mostly around the threshold between the adolescent and adult populations (median age 18 years, range 9–42 years), as previously suggested (Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). The RTK I “PDGFRA” cluster also harbored a proportion of pediatric patients (median age 36 years, range 8–74 years), in line with reports of PDGFRA CNAs being more prevalent in childhood high-grade gliomas ( Bax et al., 2010; Paugh et al., 2010; Qu et al., 2010). The Mesenchymal cluster displayed a widespread age distribution (median age 47, range 2–85 years). The IDH and RTK II “Classic” clusters were mostly comprised of younger adult (median age 40 years, range 13–71 years) and older adult (median age 58, range 36–81 years) patients, respectively, reflecting the established differences in patient age between IDH1-mutated/G-CIMP+ and IDH1 WT adult GBM ( Noushmehr et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2009).  The epigenetic GBM subgroups identified here also showed mutation-specific patterns of tumor location in the central nervous system (Figure 3A). While K27-mutated tumors were predominantly seen in midline locations, e.g., thalamus, pons, and the spinal cord (21/25 cases with available data), tumors from all other subgroups almost exclusively arose in the cerebral hemispheres (86/92, p < 0.001). To further investigate this association of mutation type and location, we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of H3F3A-mutated samples (n = 13). Gene signatures characteristic for K27 and G34 mutant GBMs were applied to a published series of 1,340 transcriptomic profiles representing multiple regions of the developing and adult human brain ( Kang et al., 2011; Figure S3). The G34 mutant signature appeared to be most strongly expressed in early embryonic regions and early- to mid-fetal stages of neocortex and striatum development. In contrast, the K27 signature most closely matched with mid- to late-fetal stages of striatum and thalamus development. Thus, G34 and K27 mutant GBMs seem to show expression patterns of early developmental stages correlating with their subsequent tumor location, possibly indicating different cellular origins and/or time of tumor initiation for these two subgroups.  Epigenetic Subgroups of GBM Correlate with Distinct Clinical Characteristics(A) ... Figure 3.

(B and C) Kaplan-Meier survival curves for GBM subgroups defined by methylation profiling (B), and mutation analysis (C). The p values were computed by log rank tests between subgroups. See also Figure S3. Figure options Correlating our proposed methylation clusters with patient survival indicated differences between mutation-defined subgroups, but this was somewhat restricted by the low number of patients with available survival data in each subgroup (Figure 3B). We therefore enlarged our survival analysis to include all tumors with known H3F3A and IDH1 mutation status ( Figure 3C). As expected, patients with IDH1 mutant tumors had a significantly longer overall survival (OS) than patients with H3F3A and IDH1 WT tumors (p < 0.001) ( Noushmehr et al., 2010; Parsons et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2009). Notably, G34 mutant GBM patients also showed a trend toward a better OS than WT tumor patients, with marginal statistical significance (p = 0.05). In contrast, patients with K27 mutations tended toward an even shorter OS than patients with WT tumors, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.12). Comparing the two H3F3A mutations, patients harboring G34-mutated tumors clearly had a longer OS than patients with tumors carrying the K27 mutation (p < 0.01). While this association may be partly linked to G34-mutated tumors being more accessible to surgery than the midline K27-mutated tumors, the better prognosis of G34 versus K27 was independent of location for those cases where both mutation type and tumor site information were available (p = 0.02; HR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.05–0.77; Cox proportional hazards model).  Integrating Methylome and Transcriptome Data Identifies Marker Genes of GBM Subgroups  A combined analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression data was used to identify subgroup-specific differentially regulated genes (Figures 4A–4C and S4A–4C; Table S3). This analysis revealed Oligodendrocyte Lineage Genes 1 and 2 (OLIG1 and OLIG2) and the neural development gene FOXG1 as top candidates for further analysis in H3F3A-mutated GBMs ( Figure 4A–4C). DNA hypermethylation across the OLIG1 and OLIG2 loci occurred exclusively in G34-mutated tumors, which concurrently displayed significantly lower OLIG1 and OLIG2 gene expression ( Figure 4D–4F). Interestingly, this pattern closely mimics that of embryonic stem cells, where epigenetic inactivation of OLIG1 and OLIG2 has been proposed as a mechanism to prevent neural lineage commitment (Meissner et al., 2008). Expression of FOXG1 was significantly lower in K27-mutated tumors than in all other subgroups, accompanied by higher levels of promoter methylation ( Figures S4A, S4D, and S4E). This comparative analysis also further supported our suggestion of a CHOP-like phenotype in G34 tumors, as most of the differentially methylated genes were found to be hypomethylated (1653/1946, 85%, Figure S4B) in this subgroup, in contrast to the hypermethylator G-CIMP pattern observed in the IDH subgroup (Figure S4C). Hypermethylation and concurrent downregulation of TP73 antisense RNA 1 (TP73-AS1) was identified as a unique characteristic of this IDH/G-CIMP+ cluster (Figures S4D and S4F). Interestingly, inactivation of this gene by promoter methylation has been reported as a common mechanism in a high proportion of oligodendrogliomas, 80% of which are also known to harbor IDH1 mutations ( Pang et al., 2010).

See also Figure S4 and Table S3. Figure options Immunohistochemical Analysis Correctly Subclassifies Mutation-Defined GBM Subgroups  In an attempt to subgroup GBM samples based on differential protein expression—a method which is likely to be more suitable for possible clinical application—we used commercially available antibodies against OLIG2, FOXG1, and mutated IDH1 (R132H) to stain a tissue-microarray (TMA) with cores from 143 pediatric GBMs, and classified tumors according to their protein expression patterns (Figures 5A and 5B; Table S4). The resulting fractions of tumors with predicted mutations in IDH1 (IDH1R132H, n = 6) and H3F3A (OLIG2+/FOXG1− for K27, n = 37, and OLIG2−/FOXG1+ for G34, n = 21) were consistent with the frequency of each mutation in the pediatric population as detected by targeted gene sequencing (Figure S1C). Our approach correctly classified GBMs with known H3F3A and IDH1 mutation status, and revealed a frequent association between OLIG2−/FOXG1+ tumors (assumed to be G34-mutated), loss of ATRX protein expression, and an ALT phenotype (Figures 5B–D), as previously reported for H3F3A G34-mutated tumors ( Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). The putative H3F3A mutant groups also did not overlap with tumors harboring IDH1 (R132H) mutations, and only one case with EGFR amplification and homozygous CDKN2A deletion was detected therein ( Figure S5A). The correlation with clinicopathological variables, such as tumor location and patient survival, also reflected our findings from the array-based analysis (Figures S5B and S5C). Of note, rare tumors represented on the TMA occurring in the basal ganglia and the spinal cord were almost always found in the OLIG2+/FOXG1− subgroup (and therefore predicted to harbor the H3F3A K27 mutation), further strengthening our hypothesis of the H3F3A K27 mutation as a unifying characteristic of midline GBM.  Identification of H3F3A-Mutated GBMs by Differential Protein Expression ... Figure 5.

Figure options Discussion We have identified six biological subgroups of GBM based on global DNA methylation patterns, which correlate with specific molecular-genetic alterations and key clinical parameters. Our findings suggest that at least 30%–40% of pediatric/young adult GBMs are likely characterized by disrupted epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, associated with recurrent and mutually exclusive mutations in either H3F3A or IDH1, and aberrant DNA methylation patterns. Placing these subgroups into the context of previous molecular GBM classification schemes described by the TCGA ( Noushmehr et al., 2010; Verhaak et al., 2010) revealed a clear correlation with DNA methylation clusters and a corresponding enrichment for previously established expression signatures in different epigenetic subgroups. We have also demonstrated that our proposed classification can refine that described by the TCGA for adult GBM, to give a stratification system that is applicable across all ages, and defines additional biologically meaningful subgroups. A simplified graphical summary of the key molecular and biological characteristics of the GBM subgroups as identified by our integrated classification strategy is given in Figure 6.  Graphical Summary of Key Molecular and Biological Characteristics of GBM ... Figure 6.  Graphical Summary of Key Molecular and Biological Characteristics of GBM Subgroups Simplified schematic representation of key genetic and epigenetic findings in six GBM subgroups as identified by methylation profiling and correlations with clinical patient data. Figure options We and others have recently described a high frequency of H3F3A K27 mutations in thalamic GBMs and in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), suggesting that the latter likely represent an anatomically-defined subset of K27 mutant GBM ( Khuong-Quang et al., 2012; Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012). We now extend this observation to a larger subgroup of GBM, characterized by the K27M mutation, which almost exclusively occurs in midline locations, including rare tumors in the basal ganglia and the spinal cord. This is in line with a recent study by Puget et al. (2012) in which gene expression patterns of brainstem gliomas were found to resemble midline/thalamic tumors, indicating a closely related origin. The K27 subgroup also displays markedly lower expression of the ventral telencephalic marker FOXG1 than other subgroups. Conversely, non-K27 tumors were restricted to hemispheric locations, further underlining the biological divergence of epigenetic GBM subgroups. While recurrent focal amplification of PDGFRA has been suggested as a key oncogenic event in pediatric DIPGs in some studies ( Paugh et al., 2011; Puget et al., 2012; Zarghooni et al., 2010), midline-associated tumors in the K27 or OLIG2+/FOXG1− subgroups (including ten brainstem gliomas with known PDGFRA copy-number status) lacked this common feature in our series. PDGFRA amplification was, however, enriched in a subgroup of supratentorial hemispheric GBMs. In part, this discrepancy may be explained by the use of autopsy (and therefore post radio/chemotherapy) material in previous study cohorts of DIPGs, which might have been confounded by the higher incidence of PDGFRA amplifications observed in radiation-induced gliomas ( Paugh et al., 2010). Nevertheless, amplifications of PDGFRA have also been detected in small numbers of pretreatment samples ( Paugh et al., 2011; Puget et al., 2012; Zarghooni et al., 2010), and post-treatment samples were not found to show increased widespread genomic instability (Paugh et al., 2011). This particularly clinically challenging subset of tumors clearly warrants further investigation, underlining the importance of routine stereotactic biopsy of DIPGs at the time of primary diagnosis.  OLIG2 has previously been reported as a universal marker for diffuse gliomas (Ligon et al., 2004), and OLIG2-positive progenitor-like cells of the subventricular zone have been suggested as potential glioma-initiating cells (Wang et al., 2009). There is also evidence that OLIG2-mediated modification of p53 function is required for complete inactivation of the latter in malignant gliomas, which typically show indirect loss of p53 activity through MDM2 amplification or p14ARF deletion (Mehta et al., 2011). Here, we describe a distinct subgroup of GBM, harboring the H3F3A G34 mutation, in which OLIG1 and OLIG2 protein expression is absent. Given the ∼100% mutation frequency of TP53 in this subgroup, this may indicate a different pathogenesis of G34-mutated GBM, in which direct inactivation of p53 is required rather than via an OLIG2-dependent mechanism.  The previously reported association of H3F3A mutations, particular the G34 mutation, with loss of ATRX and ALT ( Schwartzentruber et al., 2012) is further expanded upon here. Interestingly, the global CHOP that we observed in G34 mutants was particularly pronounced in subtelomeric regions, suggesting a possible mechanistic link with ALT in these tumors (Gonzalo et al., 2006). Whether this is a more general phenotype that can be observed in clinically and etiologically distinct subgroups of other human cancers, remains to be investigated.  The close link between H3F3A mutation type, tumor location, and differential expression of key neuronal lineage markers leads us to speculate that there may be differences in the cell of origin and/or the time of tumor development between these GBM subgroups. Although supported by the differential expression of mutant-specific gene signatures at different stages of human brain development, this remains to be formally shown. Also requiring further validation in larger, prospective cohorts is the association of the G34 mutation with better overall survival compared with H3F3A and IDH1 WT tumors, and that of K27 mutation with potentially poorer prognosis, as observed in our series and a recent cohort of pediatric DIPGs ( Khuong-Quang et al., 2012).  Given the location of the H3F3A mutations at or near critical regulatory histone residues, and their distinct methylation profiles, we consider it likely that the H3.3 mutations are directly involved in producing widespread aberrant DNA methylation and deregulation of gene expression. This has recently been shown for IDH1 mutations, which alone are sufficient to induce the global epigenetic reprogramming of the G-CIMP phenotype in normal astrocytes ( Turcan et al., 2012). Overproduction of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate in IDH1-mutated cells inhibits the TET family of 5-methlycytosine hydroxylases and H3K27-specific demethylases. This is thought to lead to decreased 5-hydroxylmethycytosine and increased H3K27 methylation ( Xu et al., 2011), resulting in aberrant DNA and histone methylation, and a block to differentiation (Christensen et al., 2011; Dang et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2012).  Seminal studies have shown that DNA methylation patterns are tightly linked to histone 3 lysine K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) patterns (Brinkman et al., 2012; Statham et al., 2012), and in high-CpG-density promoters, loss of H3K4me3 and retention of H3K4me2 or H3K27me3 is correlated with an increase in DNA methylation (Meissner et al., 2008). Therefore, mutations affecting H3K27 methylation are likely to affect DNA methylation. In addition, mutations in ATRX have been shown to give rise to changes in the patterns of DNA methylation of several highly repeated sequences, which further supports the link between chromatin remodeling machinery and DNA methylation (Gibbons et al., 2000). Based on our current knowledge, the incorporation of H3.3 variants into the genome, and the subsequent effects on gene regulation, involve the H3.3 chaperone complex (including ATRX and DAXX) in a replication independent manner (Drané et al., 2010; Goldberg et al., 2010) but other factors also likely play a role. The exact mechanism by which the H3F3A mutations might be inducing epigenetic reprogramming requires further elucidation.  In conclusion, this study describes a number of findings that enhance our understanding of the heterogeneity of GBM, as well as shedding light on potential cellular origins and oncogenic pathways leading to gliomagenesis. We have identified potential prognostic biomarkers, which may be further exploited for molecular diagnostic purposes, and also provided a focus for future work at a basic and translational/targeted therapeutic level, particularly in a pediatric and young adult setting.  Experimental Procedures Patients and Tumor Samples  Primary tumor samples for methylation (n = 136; Table S1), mutation (n = 460; Table S2), and gene expression (n = 69) analysis and all clinical data were collected at the DKFZ (Heidelberg, Germany) and at McGill University (Montreal, Canada). Paraffin-embedded samples (n = 143; Table S4) for TMA analysis were collected from the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute (Moscow, Russia) and from the Department of Neuropathology, University of Würzburg (Germany). Patient clinical details can be found in Table S1 for the methylation analysis data set and in Table S4 for the TMA cohort. All of the tumors were banked at the time of primary diagnosis between 1994 and 2011 in accordance with research ethics board approval from the respective institutes. Informed consent was obtained from all patients included in this study. An overview of all samples included in different data collections is given in Figure S1A. All of the samples were independently reviewed by senior pediatric neuropathologists (S.A. and A.K.) according to the WHO guidelines. Detailed information about samples provided by TCGA can be found elsewhere (http://cancergenome.nih.gov).  DNA Methylation Profiling  For genome-wide assessment of DNA methylation GBM samples (n = 136) and controls (n = 10; four fetal and two adult samples of non-neoplastic cerebellum; two samples of Whole-Genome Amplified DNA (unmethylated control; two samples of M.SssI-treated DNA [100% methylated control]) were arrayed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip according to the manufacturer’s instructions at the DKFZ. Methylation data of additional adult glioblastoma samples (n = 74) were obtained from the TCGA website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov; available data from TCGA batches 79 and 111).  The following filtering criteria were applied: Removal of probes targeting the X and Y chromosomes (n = 11,551), removal of probes containing a single-nucleotide polymorphism (dbSNP132 Common) within five base pairs of and including the targeted CpG-site (n = 24,536), and probes not mapping uniquely to the human reference genome (hg19) allowing for one mismatch (n = 9,993). In total, 438,370 probes were kept for analysis.  For a subset of differentially methylated genes from the 450k array, MassARRAY technology (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to validate our results, allowing us to compare DNA methylation levels at 29 individual CpG-sites investigated by both techniques. DNA methylation measurements of those 29 CpG dinucleotides were highly correlated (median Pearson’s correlation: r = 0.96; range: 0.71–1.00).  Gene Expression Profiling  Glioblastoma samples for which RNA of sufficient quantity and quality was available (n = 69) were analyzed on the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array at the Microarray Department of the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Sample library preparation, hybridization, and quality control were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Expression data were normalized using the MAS5.0 algorithm of the GCOS program (Affymetrix Inc). Gene expression data of additional adult glioblastoma samples (n = 74) were obtained from the TCGA website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov; available data from TCGA batches 79 and 111). Predictive analysis of microarrays was used to assign TCGA methylation and gene expression subgroups to each of the samples in the present study.  Detection of CNAs  Copy-number aberrations were detected from the 450k Infinium methylation array in a custom approach using the sum of both methylated and unmethylated signals (Figure S1D). For the detection of EGFR and PDGFRA high-level amplifications, homozygous CDKN2A deletions, and CNAs affecting chromosomes 7 and 10 (as depicted in Figure 1), automatic scoring was verified by manual curation of the respective loci for each individual profile, and compared with results obtained from SNP profiling and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis where available. The three methodologies showed very high concordance.  Statistical Analysis and Measurement of Differential DNA Methylation and Gene Expression  For unsupervised consensus clustering we used the 8,000 most variable methylated probes (by standard deviation) across the data set (R package: clusterCons) (Monti et al., 2003; Wilkerson and Hayes, 2010). The consensus matrix was calculated using the k-means algorithm (10 random starting sets, maximum of 1,000 iterations) on a fraction of probes (0.8) in 1,000 iterations. The significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method was used to identify genes that are differentially methylated or differentially expressed between subgroups. Correction for multiple testing was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Genes were considered significantly differentially methylated/expressed between two subgroups when displaying an adjusted p value < 0.01 and a methylation difference of 0.2 or a 2-fold change in expression.  Statistical Analysis of Clinical and Molecular Data  Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate the survival time of different GBM subgroups and a log rank test was used to test for differences of more than one survival curve. Comparisons of binary and categorical patient characteristics between subgroups were performed by the use of a two-sided Fisher’s exact test. An unpaired t test was used to test for differences between the mean values for continuous variables in GBM subgroups.  Immunohistochemistry and FISH  Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections from all 143 paraffin blocks were prepared to define representative tumor regions for inclusion in the TMA. Antibodies against the following antigens were applied: OLIG2 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; AB9610; dilution 1:250), FOXG1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab18259; dilution 1:50), ATRX (Sigma, HPA001906; dilution 1:750), and mutated IDH1 (R132H; (Capper et al., 2010; dianova, DIA H09). Multicolor interphase FISH analysis for PDGFRA, EGFR, and CDKN2A was performed as described ( Pfister et al., 2009). Telomere-specific FISH was done using a standard formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FISH protocol (Heaphy et al., 2011) using a FITC peptide nucleic acid telomere probe from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark).  Genomic Sequencing  Targeted sequencing of H3F3A (first coding exon), IDH1 (exon 4), and TP53 (all exons) was performed by QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany) in both forward and reverse directions using purified PCR products. PCR procedures were as previously described ( Pfaff et al., 2010). Primer sequences are available upon request. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children. However, DNA copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases1, 2, 3, 4. To explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric GBM samples. Somatic mutations in the H3.3-ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). Recurrent mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. Mutations in ATRX (α-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked)5 and DAXX (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for H3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres6, 7, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation. Somatic TP53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with H3F3A and/or ATRX mutations. Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to GBM and highly prevalent in children and young adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. This is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult GBM pathogenesis.

Figure 3 right Main Main• Methods• References• Acknowledgements• Author information• Supplementary information Brain tumours are currently the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity in children. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumour and the first cancer to be comprehensively profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium. Whereas GBM is less common in the paediatric setting than in adults, affected children show dismal outcomes similar to adult patients, and the vast majority will die within a few years of diagnosis despite aggressive therapeutic approaches. Tumours arise de novo (primary GBM) and are morphologically indistinguishable from their adult counterparts. A number of comprehensive studies have identified transcriptome-based subgroups and indicator mutations in adult GBM, and have thus enabled its molecular sub-classification8, 9, 10, 11. In contrast, although we and others have demonstrated the presence of distinct molecular subsets of childhood GBM and described different genetic alterations compared to adult cases, the paediatric disease remains understudied1, 2, 3, 4, 12. There is currently insufficient information to improve disease management, and because conventional treatments universally fail, there is a crucial need to identify relevant targets for the design of new therapeutic agents.  To decipher the molecular pathogenesis of paediatric GBM, we undertook a comprehensive mutation analysis in protein-coding genes by performing whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 48 well-characterized paediatric GBMs, including 6 patients for whom we had matched non-tumour (germline) DNA. Samples from the tumour core containing more than 90% neoplastic tissue were collected from patients aged between 3 and 20 years (Supplementary Table 1). Coding regions of the genome were enriched by capture with the Illumina TruSeq kit and sequenced with 100-base-pairs paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Supplementary Methods). The median coverage of each base in the targeted regions was 61-fold, and 91% of the bases were represented by at least 10 reads (Supplementary Table 2). We identified 87 somatic mutations in 80 genes among the 6 tumours for which we had matched constitutive DNA. The mutation count per tumour ranged from 3 to 31, with a mean of 15 (Supplementary Table 3). This is much lower than the rate observed using Sanger sequencing in other solid tumours including adult GBM11, but somewhat higher than in another paediatric brain tumour, medulloblastoma13 (Supplementary Table 4). Relevant mutations (as defined below) were validated by Sanger sequencing.  Initially, we focused on the distribution of somatic, non-silent protein-coding mutations in the six tumours with matched germline DNA. Four samples had recurrent heterozygous mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone variant H3.3. Both mutations were single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), in two samples changing lysine 27 to methionine (K27M), and in two samples changing glycine 34 to arginine (G34R) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 3). These mutations are particularly interesting because histone genes are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes (Fig. 1b), and to our knowledge no human disorders have specifically been associated with mutations in histones, including H3.3. Both mutations are at or very near positions in the amino-terminal tail of the protein that undergo important post-translational modifications associated with either transcriptional repression (K27) or activation (K36) (Fig. 1b). All four samples additionally harboured mutations in ATRX, which encodes a member of a transcription/chromatin remodelling complex required for the incorporation of H3.3 at pericentric heterochromatin and at telomeres, as well as at several transcription factor binding sites7, 14, 15, 16, 17. We extended our WES analysis to 42 additional tumour samples and focused on ATRX and H3F3A, as well as DAXX (because the gene product heterodimerizes with ATRX and participates in H3.3 recruitment to DNA6, 7). A total of 15 samples had heterozygous H3.3 mutations (9 K27M, 5 G34R, 1 G34V) and 14 samples had a mutation in ATRX, including frameshift insertions/deletions (6 samples), gains of a stop codon (4 samples), and missense SNVs (4 samples). Nearly all of the ATRX mutations occurred either within the carboxy-terminal helicase domain or led to truncation of the protein upstream of this domain (Fig. 1c). Mutations were accompanied by an absence of detectable ATRX protein by immunohistochemistry in samples for which paraffin material was available (Supplementary Fig. 1). Two samples had heterozygous DAXX mutations, simultaneously with an ATRX mutation in one sample (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 3). Overall, 21 of 48 samples (44%) had a mutation in at least one of these three genes. Notably, we also identified TP53 mutations in 26 samples (25 somatic, 1 germline in PGBM26), which overlapped significantly with samples that had ATRX, DAXX and/or H3F3A mutations (18/21 cases, 86%, Fig. 1d; P = 1.1 × 10−4, permutation test). A list of all mutations discovered by WES in selected genes associated with GBM is given in Supplementary Table 5.  Figure 1: Most frequent mutations in paediatric GBM. Most frequent mutations in paediatric GBM. a, Most frequent somatic mutations in 48 paediatric glioblastoma tumours. Mutations identified in genes listed in this table were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and were not present in dbSNP nor in the 1000 Genomes data set (October 2011), except for the TP53 SNP at R273, which is associated with cancer. Detailed description of the mutations in affected samples is provided in Supplementary Table 5. b, Three recurrent non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were observed in H3F3A. The K27M, G34R and G34V mutations are shown in the context of the common post-translational modifications of the H3.3 N-terminal tail, which regulates the histone code. H3.3 has 136 amino acids, and is highly conserved across species from mammals to plants, including the residues subject to mutation in paediatric GBM (see multiple alignment of amino acids 11 to 60). c, Schematic of the mutations observed in ATRX in the 48 WES samples. d, Schematic of the overlap between mutations affecting ATRX-DAXX, H3F3A and TP53.

To investigate whether H3F3A mutations are specific to GBM and/or paediatric disease, we sequenced this gene in 784 glioma samples from all grades and histological diagnoses across the entire age range (Fig. 2a). H3.3 mutations were highly specific to GBM and were much more prevalent in the paediatric setting (32/90, 36%), although they also occurred rarely in young adults with GBM (11/318, 3%) (Fig. 2b). K27M-H3.3 mutations occurred mainly in younger patients (median age 11 years, range 5–29) and thalamic GBM (Supplementary Table 1), whereas G34R- or G34V-H3.3 mutations occurred in older patients (median age 20 years, range 9–42) and in tumours of the cerebral hemispheres (Fig. 2b). Further comparison of our data set with adult GBM databases8, 10, 11, 18, 19 indicated limited overlap in frequently mutated genes between paediatric GBM and any of the four previously described adult GBM subtypes18 (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 6).

K27M-H3.3 mutations occur mainly in younger patients (median age 11 years) and G34R/V-H3.3 mutations occur in older children and young adults (median age 20 years). No H3.3 mutations were identified in older patients with GBM. c, Comparison of the most frequently mutated genes in paediatric and adult GBM shows that H3F3A, ATRX and DAXX mutations are largely specific to paediatric disease. Except for similarities in the mutation rate for TP53 and PDGFRA with the previously identified proneural adult GBM subgroup, the rate and type of genes mutated were distinct between paediatric and adult GBM whatever the molecular subgroup27 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Data for adult GBM regarding other genes included in the table was compiled from refs 11 and 18. d, ATRX and DAXX immunohistochemical staining of a paediatric GBM tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 124 samples.

A follow-up study found ATRX mutations in a series of cancers, including GBM, where ATRX (but not DAXX) mutations were identified in 3/21 paediatric GBMs (14%) and 8/122 adult GBMs (7%)20. To evaluate further the prevalence of ATRX and DAXX mutations in paediatric GBM, we performed immunostaining for these proteins on a well-characterized tissue microarray (TMA) with samples from 124 paediatric GBM patients. Lack of immunopositivity for ATRX was seen in 35% of cases (40/113 scored, 22 females and 18 males) and for DAXX in 6% (7/124 scored) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall, 37% of samples had lost nuclear expression of either factor, corroborating our WES findings. Strikingly, ATRX-DAXX mutations (as assessed by direct sequencing or loss of protein expression) were found in 100% of G34-H3.3 mutant cases in the larger cohort of GBMs (13/13) where sufficient material was available (P = 1.4 × 10−8, permutation test). The overlap of ATRX mutations with K27M-H3.3-mutated samples was not significant in either the exome data set (3/9 samples, P = 0.58) or the full set of GBM screened (5/13, P = 0.40) (Fig. 2e).  The histone code—post-translational modifications of specific histone residues—regulates virtually all processes that act on or depend on DNA, including replication and repair, regulation of gene expression, and maintenance of centromeres and telomeres21. Accordingly, although recurrent histone mutations have not previously been reported in cancer, mutations in genes affecting histone post-translational modifications are increasingly described22. H3.3 is a universal, replication-independent histone predominantly incorporated into transcription sites and telomeric regions, and associated with active and open chromatin (reviewed in ref. 23). This role is conserved in the single histone H3 present in yeast, indicating its importance throughout evolution. It functions as a neutral replacement histone, but also participates in the epigenetic transmission of active chromatin states and is associated with chromatin assembly factors in large-scale replication-independent chromatin remodelling events23.  The non-random recurrence of the exact same mutation in different tumours, and the absence of truncating mutations, indicate that H3F3A mutations are most probably gain-of-function events. Lysine 27 is a critical residue of histone 3 and its variants, and methylation at this position (H3K27me), which may be mimicked by the terminal CH3 of methionine substituted at this residue, is commonly associated with transcriptional repression24. In contrast, H3K36 methylation or acetylation typically promotes gene transcription25, 26. Thus, although their morphological phenotype is very similar (K27M and G34R/V mutant tumours are histologically indistinguishable), the two H3.3 variants are expected to act through a different set of genes. This indeed seems to be the case when looking at expression profiles of GBMs harbouring these two mutations. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression from 27 of the WES cohort samples for which sufficient RNA was available revealed a clear separation in the expression of K27M versus G34R/V mutant samples (Supplementary Fig. 3). Further analysis of just those samples harbouring an H3F3A mutation additionally showed a clear distinction in the expression pattern of these two variants (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 7). Among these differentially expressed genes were several linked to brain development that showed a clear mutation-specific expression pattern when comparing both between K27 and G34 mutants and with H3.3 wild-type GBMs, including DLX2, SFRP2, FZD7 and MYT1 (Fig. 3b). We also identified increased levels of H3K36 trimethylation in cells carrying the G34V-H3.3 mutation in one sample for which we had available material (PGBM14) compared to other cells, potentially supporting this hypothesis (Supplementary Fig. 5).  Figure 3: H3F3A mutation variants show distinct expression profiles and are associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres. H3F3A mutation variants show distinct expression profiles and are associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres. a, Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes in 27 of the 48 GBM samples analysed by whole-exome sequencing shows that samples with K27M and G34R/V H3.3 have specific gene expression profiles. Clustering was based on the top 100 genes by standard deviation from autosomal genes detected as present in >10% of samples (see also Supplementary Fig. 3). b, Genes involved in development and differentiation show H3.3 mutation-specific expression patterns. Expression levels of developmental-related genes including DLX2, SFRP2, FZD7 and MYT1 are distinct among H3.3-K27 mutant and H3.3-G34 mutants following gene expression profiling (see also Supplementary Table 7). c, Alternate lengthening of telomere (ALT) is associated with the presence of mutant H3F3A/ATRX in a tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 124 paediatric GBM samples. We assessed ALT using telomere-specific FISH (shown here and in Supplementary Fig. 4) on the paediatric TMA we investigated for ATRX expression (Fig. 2d) and using telomere-specific Southern blotting of high molecular weight genomic DNA (data not shown). Fisher’s exact test was used to identify any association relationship. Representative images of ALT-positive and -negative staining of a paediatric GBM tissue microarray and a control brain are provided.  Full size image (120 KB) Download PowerPoint slide (243K) Previous Figures index ATRX loss, frequently observed in this study, has recently been shown to be associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) in PanNETs and GBMs20. We performed telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on the samples with K27M or G34R/V mutations identified by WES for which we had slides available (Supplementary Fig. 4) and on the paediatric GBM TMA (Fig. 3c). These experiments showed that ALT is strongly correlated with ATRX loss (37/47 samples with ALT showed ATRX loss, P < 0.001). However, some samples with nuclear ATRX staining still showed ALT, indicating that additional defects may also account for elongated telomeres in GBM. The presence of ALT was best explained by the simultaneous presence of ATRX/H3F3A/TP53 mutations (P = 0.0002, Fisher’s exact test). Tumours without ATRX/H3F3A/TP53 mutations almost invariably showed shorter telomeres than are observed with ALT, as seen in telomerase-positive gliomas27.  Genetic stability was also assessed through evaluating DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 31 of the 48 tumours using Illumina SNP arrays containing ~2.5 million oligonucleotides (Supplementary Tables 1, 8, 9). Loss of heterozygosity (whole chromosome changes, broad and focal heterozygous deletions, Supplementary Table 9) was common in paediatric GBM samples, as we have previously reported4, and the focal gains and losses we identified in our study showed a high degree of overlap with other published paediatric data sets3, 21. The number of CNAs per tumour was higher in samples with H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 6).  Recurrent point mutations in IDH1 (mainly R132H) are gain of function mutations commonly identified in secondary GBM and the lower-grade tumours from which they develop (86–98% of these astrocytomas), and typically occur in younger adults11, 28. Strikingly, IDH1 and H3F3A mutations were mutually exclusive in our sequencing cohort (P = 1.6 × 10−4). Neomorphic enzyme activity resulting from IDH1 mutation leads to the production of high quantities of the onco-metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG)29. Increased 2-HG inhibits histone demethylases, specifically inducing increased methylation of both H3K27 and H3K3629, 30, the two residues affected directly (K27) or indirectly (K36) by the mutations in H3F3A uncovered in this study. Furthermore, overlap of H3F3A and TP53 mutations in children with GBM (all of the G34R/V and 82% of K27M mutants also harbour TP53 mutations) mirrors the large overlap of IDH1 mutations with TP53 mutations in the proneural adult GBM sub-group18. Thus, mutations which directly (H3F3A), or indirectly (IDH1) affect the methylation of H3.3 K27 or H3.3 K36, in combination with TP53 mutations, characterize the pathogenesis of paediatric and young adult GBM.  Our data indicate a central role of H3.3/ATRX-DAXX perturbation in paediatric GBM. Mutant H3.3 recruitment would occur across the genome and induce abnormal patterns of chromatin remodelling to yield distinct gene expression profiles for the K27 and G34 mutations. Additional loss of ATRX may act to reduce H3.3 incorporation at a subset of genes important in oncogenesis, preventing mutant H3.3 from altering their transcription. ATRX loss will also impair H3.3 loading at telomeres and disrupt their heterochromatic state, facilitating alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Our findings provide an intriguing example of the interplay of genetic and epigenetic events in driving cancer, indicate a new mechanism through which these epigenetic alterations are brought about (mutation of key residues in a regulatory histone), and provide a rationale for targeting the chromatin remodelling machinery in this deadly paediatric cancer.  Methods Main• Methods• References• Acknowledgements• Author information• Supplementary information Sample characteristics and pathological review All samples were obtained with informed consent after approval of the Institutional Review Board of the respective hospitals they were treated in and were independently reviewed by senior paediatric neuropathologists (S.A., A.K.) according to the WHO guidelines. Forty-eight paediatric grade IV astrocytomas (glioblastoma GBM) patients between the age of 3 and 20 years were included in the study. Clinical characteristics of patients are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Samples were taken at the time of the first surgery, before further treatment as needed. Tissues were obtained from the London/Ontario Tumour Bank of the Pediatric Cooperative Health Tissue Network, the Montreal Children’s Hospital and from collaborators in Hungary and Germany. Seven hundred and eighty-four glioma samples from all grades and histological diagnoses across the entire age range in this study were obtained from collaborators across Europe and North America.  Alignment and variant calling for whole-exome sequencing We followed standard manufacturer protocols to perform target capture with the Illumina TruSeq exome enrichment kit and sequencing of 100 bp paired end reads on Illumina HiSeq. We generated approximately 10 Gb of sequence for each subject such that >90% of the coding bases of the exome defined by the consensus coding sequence (CCDS) project were covered by at least 10 reads. We removed adaptor sequences and quality trimmed reads using the Fastx toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) and then used a custom script to ensure that only read pairs with both mates present were subsequently used. Reads were aligned to hg19 with BWA31, and duplicate reads were marked using Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) and excluded from downstream analyses. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions and deletions (indels) were called using samtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) pileup and varFilter32 with the base alignment quality (BAQ) adjustment disabled, and were then quality filtered to require at least 20% of reads supporting the variant call. Variants were annotated using both ANNOVAR33 and custom scripts to identify whether they affected protein coding sequence, and whether they had previously been seen in dbSNP131, the 1000 Genomes data set (October 2011), or in approximately 160 exomes previously sequenced at our centre.  Somatic mutation identification for whole-exome sequencing A variant called in a tumour was considered to be a candidate somatic mutation if the matched normal sample had at least 10 reads covering this position and had zero variant reads, and the variant was not reported in dbSNP131 or the 1000 Genomes data set (October 2011). For the resulting 117 candidate somatic mutations, we manually examined the alignment of each to check for sequencing artefacts and alignment errors. Fifteen variants were easily identified as sequence-specific error artefacts commonly seen shortly downstream of GGC sequences on Illumina sequencers34. Once genes of interest were identified (H3F3A, ATRX, DAXX, TP53, NF1), we examined positions in these genes in the 34 tumour samples where less than 20% of the reads supported the variant. This identified only two additional variants, both in sample PGBM19 where there were low read counts for frameshift insertions in both ATRX (6/32 reads) and DAXX (8/47 reads).  Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of paediatric GBM and TMA (4 µm) were immunohistochemically stained for ATRX and DAXX proteins. Unstained sections were subjected to antigen retrieval in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min at sub-boiling temperatures. Individual slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-ATRX (1:750 dilution, Sigma, catalogue no. HPA001906) or rabbit anti-DAXX (1:100 dilution, Sigma, catalogue no. HPA008736) antibodies. After incubation with the primary antibody, secondary biotin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson) were applied for 30 min. After washing with PBS, slides were developed with diaminobenzidine (Dako) as the chromogen. All slides were counterstained using Harris haematoxylin. The criterion for positive staining was described previously20. Immunohistochemistry staining on TMA was scored by three individuals independently, including a pathologist. To test the level of mono-, di- and trimethylated H3 at position K36, cell lysates from tumour cells were analysed by western blot. Antibodies against H3K36me3 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab9050), H3K36me2 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab9049), H3K36me1 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab9048) and H3.3 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab97968) were used, with conditions suggested by the manufacturer.  Gene expression profiling Total RNA from frozen samples was hybridized to Affymetrix-HG-U133 plus 2.0 gene chips (Affymetrix). Array quality assurance was determined using β-actin and GAPDH 3′/5′ ratio, as recommended by the manufacturer.  Genome-wide SNP array DNA from 31 of the 48 paediatric GBM tumours analysed by whole-exome sequencing was hybridized to Illumina Human Omni 2.5M Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) arrays, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Copy number alterations were analysed using Illumina GenomeStudio Data Analysis Software (Illumina) as previously described35. Statistical analysis of Fisher’s exact test was performed using GraphPad Prism software.  Telomere specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Telomere-specific FISH was done using a standard formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FISH protocol (as described in ref. 20), using a FITC peptide nucleic acid telomere probe from Dako.  
750||Purpose: Mutations associated with resistance to kinase inhibition are an important mechanism of intrinsic or acquired loss of clinical efficacy for kinase-targeted therapeutics. We report the prospective discovery of ErbB2 mutations that confer resistance to the small-molecule inhibitor lapatinib.  Experimental Design: We did in vitro screening using a randomly mutagenized ErbB2 expression library in Ba/F3 cells, which were dependent on ErbB2 activity for survival and growth.  Results: Lapatinib resistance screens identified mutations at 16 different ErbB2 amino acid residues, with 12 mutated amino acids mapping to the kinase domain. Mutations conferring the greatest lapatinib resistance cluster in the NH2-terminal kinase lobe and hinge region. Structural computer modeling studies suggest that lapatinib resistance is caused by multiple mechanisms; including direct steric interference and restriction of conformational flexibility (the inactive state required for lapatinib binding is energetically unfavorable). ErbB2 T798I imparts the strongest lapatinib resistance effect and is analogous to the epidermal growth factor receptor T790M, ABL T315I, and cKIT T670I gatekeeper mutations that are associated with clinical drug resistance. ErbB2 mutants associated with lapatinib resistance transformed NIH-3T3 cells, including L755S and T733I mutations known to occur in human breast and gastric carcinomas, supporting a direct mechanism for lapatinib resistance in ErbB2-driven human cancers. The epidermal growth factor receptor/ErbB2/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor EXEL-7647 was found to inhibit almost all lapatinib resistance-associated mutations. Furthermore, no ErbB2 mutations were found to be associated with EXEL-7647 resistance and lapatinib sensitivity.  Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest potential target-based mechanisms of resistance to lapatinib and suggest that EXEL-7647 may be able to circumvent these effects.  The discovery of genetic alterations associated with tumor growth and therapeutic response is critical to the development of effective cancer therapeutics. Kinase activation by mutation, gene amplification, or other means can engage growth-regulating signal transduction pathways that play vital roles in many cancers. Discoveries connecting kinase activation with defined types of human cancer (e.g., BCR-ABL with chronic myelogenous leukemia or cKIT with gastrointestinal stromal tumors) have led to the successful use of kinase inhibitors as cancer therapies. However, certain patients fail to respond, and often, favorable patient response to kinase inhibition is followed by acquired drug resistance that limits overall therapeutic benefit.  Resistance to kinase inhibitors can arise by mutation of the targeted kinase to cause interference of inhibitor activity or activation of alternate signaling pathways to relieve tumor growth addiction to the targeted kinase. The association of kinase mutations with therapeutic resistance to inhibitors of BCR-ABL (1–5), cKIT (6–10), platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (11), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; refs. 12–15) kinases is well established. Imatinib resistance via mutation of BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia and mutation of cKIT in gastrointestinal stromal tumors provides a paradigm for the importance of kinase mutations as a mechanism for drug resistance and the clinical need for pharmacologic agents targeting a diverse range of mutant kinases. Next-generation ABL kinase inhibitors, including dasatinib and nilotinib, have been identified that inhibit imatinib-associated resistance mutations and offer promising therapies for chronic myelogenous leukemia patients (16–20). Similarly, defined resistance-associated mutation profiles are emerging in gastrointestinal stromal tumors following clinical treatment with imatinib and sunitinib (9, 21, 22). Several small-molecule EGFR-targeted drugs are emerging that inhibit the EGFR T790M mutation associated with resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib in non–small cell lung cancer, including EXEL-7647 (23), BMS-690514 (24), and the irreversible inhibitor HKI-272 (25).  ErbB2 kinase domain mutations have been identified in human cancers originating from multiple tissues at a frequency of approximately 2% to 5% (26–31). Affected tumor types include breast, gastric, and ovarian carcinomas, non–small cell lung adenocarcinomas, and glioblastomas. The therapeutic relevance of the ErbB2 mutations remains to be determined, although many are homologous to known EGFR mutations that confer resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib. Documented mutations include single amino acid substitutions and short amino acid insertions. Mutations are found in structural regions of the kinase that could alter the kinase activation state, including the Cα-helix and activation loop. In vitro, the in-frame kinase domain YVMA insertion at G776 found in non–small cell lung adenocarcinomas is associated with increased ErbB2 kinase activity, potent cellular transformation, decreased potency of ErbB2 kinase inhibition by lapatinib, and resistance to the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib due to transphosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB3 (32). The established association of BCR-ABL, cKIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, and EGFR kinase mutations with resistance to small-molecule kinase inhibitors provides examples of how cancer-associated ErbB2 mutations may affect the clinical benefit of ErbB2 inhibitors. Furthermore, the discovery of novel ErbB2 mutations associated with human tumors may accelerate with the advancement of ongoing cancer genome sequencing efforts as well as with the clinical administration of the recently approved small-molecule ErbB2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib (Tykerb; ref. 33). Knowledge of ErbB2 mutations that have the capacity to confer therapeutic resistance to lapatinib would provide valuable guidance as to potential mechanisms by which clinical resistance to lapatinib may arise, and allow for screening of novel small molecules that could inhibit lapatinib-resistant ErbB2 variants.  Here, we report the prospective discovery and characterization of ErbB2 mutations that confer resistance to lapatinib. ErbB2 mutations associated with lapatinib resistance were discovered by in vitro screening of a randomly mutagenized ErbB2 expression library in Ba/F3 cells that were dependent on ErbB2 activity for survival and growth. This approach has been used to discover clinically relevant BCR-ABL mutations that confer resistance to imatinib and dasatinib (34). In our studies, mutations at 16 different ErbB2 amino acid residues were associated with significant lapatinib resistance. The ErbB2 resistance-associated mutations were cloned and expressed to confirm that lapatinib resistance was conferred by the detected mutation. Mutation characterization using in vitro cell-based mechanistic and phenotypic studies showed that lapatinib resistance is correlated with sustained activation of ErbB2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the presence of lapatinib and presents a potential direct mechanism for lapatinib drug resistance in ErbB2-driven tumors. EXEL-7647, a potent inhibitor of ErbB2, EGFR, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 receptor tyrosine kinases, retained significant activity against mutations associated with lapatinib resistance.  Materials and Methods  Reagents. Lapatinib was synthesized according to published methods (35). EXEL-7647 (23) was synthesized by the medicinal chemistry group at Exelixis, Inc.  Cell culture. GP2-293 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 units/mL streptomycin, and 0.1 mmol/L MEM nonessential amino acids (Mediatech, Inc.). Ba/F3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, 1 ng/mL interleukin-3 (IL-3), and the supplements above. NIH-3T3 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% calf serum and the supplements above.  ErbB2 mutation library construction and resistance-associated mutation screening. ErbB2 random mutagenesis and resistance mutation screening were based on the protocol published by Azam et al. (34). ErbB2-V659E cDNA was cloned for cellular expression with a COOH-terminal FLAG tag by insertion into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pRV2 vector to yield the pRV2-ErbB2-V659E construct. Plasmid DNA (1 μg) was used to transform the repair-deficient Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Red (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transformants were selected on Luria-Bertani agar plates with 100 μg/mL ampicillin (Fisher Scientific). Colonies were collected after 24 h and plasmid DNA was isolated using the EndoFree Plasmid Purification Mega kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's procedures. The mutation rate was determined by DNA sequencing 70,000 bp and found to be 4.35 × 10−5/bp.  For infection of Ba/F3 with ErbB2-expressing retrovirus, GP2-293 packaging cells (Clontech) were cotransfected with mutated pRV2-ErbB2-V659E cDNA and pVSV-G using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche) for the production of retrovirus. Retrovirus-containing supernatant was harvested 3 d after transfection with plasmid DNA, cleared by centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge at 2,000 rpm for 5 min, and used to infect Ba/F3 cells. For retrovirus infection, the cleared supernatant was mixed 1:1 with RPMI 1640 that contained 2 ng/mL IL-3 and 16 μg/mL polybrene (Sigma). The infection mixture (12 mL) was added to 12 × 106 Ba/F3 cells that were harvested in log-phase growth by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 4 min. The cell suspension (1 mL) was transferred to each well of a 12-well tissue culture plate. The plate was subsequently centrifuged for 90 min with 2,500 rpm at 30°C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra 6R centrifuge. After centrifugation, the cells were incubated for 4 to 6 h at 37°C and then transferred to cell culture flasks containing fresh Ba/F3 cell medium.  Retrovirus-infected Ba/F3 cells were selected by growth in medium without IL-3. Twenty-four hours after retrovirus infection, IL-3 was removed by washing cells twice in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. After an additional 48 h, the cells were plated in soft agar medium containing 400 to 1,200 nmol/L lapatinib. To grow cells in soft agar medium, 2 × 106 to 8 × 106 cells were mixed with 9.6 mL RPMI 1640, 3.2 mL FCS, 3.2 mL of 1.5% agar in PBS, and varied concentrations of lapatinib (400, 800, or 1,200 nmol/L). The mixture was plated at 2 mL/well into six-well plates that had been precoated with 1 mL/well of the same mixture without cells. Twenty-four hours after cell plating, the wells were overlaid with 1 mL RPMI 1640 and 10% FBS containing the same drug concentration as the soft agar. After allowing 10 to 14 d for cell growth, single colonies of cells were picked and expanded separately in 2 mL RPMI 1640 and 10% FBS in the presence of 300 nmol/L lapatinib. Cells (48 × 106) were screened by this procedure. Screening for EXEL-7647 resistance was conducted in a similar manner. After expansion, genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen). The ErbB2 region from exons 11 to 27, corresponding to the juxtamembrane, kinase, and COOH-terminal domains, was amplified as the three overlapping PCR products using TaKaRa LA Taq DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa Bio USA) with the following PCR primers: ErbB2_ex11-19.F, 5′-TCCGGGGACGAATTCTGCACA-3′; ErbB2_ex11-19.R, 5′-TCACATTCTCCCCATCAGGGATCCA-3′; ErbB2_ex17-25.F, 5′-TCTTTGGGATCCTCATCAAG-3′; ErbB2_ex17-25.R, 5′-AGGGTCTGGACAGAAGAAGC-3′; ErbB2_ex24-27.F, 5′-ATTGACTCTGAATGTCGGCC-3′; ErbB2_ex24-27.R, 5′-CACTGGCACGTCCAGACCC-3′.  The resulting PCR products were sequenced bidirectionally using the following nested and internal sequencing primers: ErbB2_ex11-19.SF1, 5′-GGCGCCTACTCGCTGACCCTGC-3′; ErbB2_ex11-19.SR1, 5′-GCCAAAAGCGCCAGATCCAAGCA-3′; ErbB2_ex11-19.SF2, 5′-CTCAGTGACCTGTTTTGG-3′; ErbB2_ex11-19.SR2, 5′-AGGTCAGGTTTCACACCG-3′; ErbB2_ex17-25.SF1, 5′-CAGCAGAAGATCCGGAAGTA-3′; ErbB2_ex17-25.SR1, 5′-ATACTCCTCAGCATCCACCA-3′; ErbB2_ex17-25.SF2, 5′-GCCTCTTAGACCATGTCC-3′; ErbB2_ex17-25.SR2, 5′-ATCCTCCAGGTAGCTCATCC-3′; ErbB2_ex24-27.SF1, 5′-CGGGAGTTGGTGTCTGAATT-3′; ErbB2_ex24-27.SR1, 5′-CTCTGGGTTCTCTGCCGTAG-3′; ErbB2_ex24-27.SF2, 5′-AAGCCTCCCCACACATGACC-3′; ErbB2_ex24-27.SR2, 5′-TTCACATATTCAGGCTGG-3′.  Sequence analysis was done with the Phred/Phrap/Consed package (University of Washington, Seattle, WA).  Site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations identified in Ba/F3 cell viability screening were introduced into the appropriate constructs by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides for mutation insertion were designed using the Primer 3 program (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and synthesized by Operon, Inc. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed in each case by DNA sequencing.  Cell viability assay. For drug treatment, Ba/F3 cells expressing mutant ErbB2 constructs were plated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 0.5 × 105 per well in 97 μL medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS but without IL-3). Serial 3-fold dilutions of lapatinib or EXEL-7647 in DMSO were prepared and further diluted 1:10 in RPMI 1640 for addition to the assay solution. RPMI 1640–diluted compound (3 μL) was added per well, bringing the final reaction volume to 100 μL. Final drug concentrations in assay wells were 30,000, 10,000, 3,300, 1,100, 370, 123, 41, 14, 5, and 0 nmol/L. Assays were done in triplicate at each drug concentration. Forty-eight hours after compound addition, the number of viable cells was measured using the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminosity per well was determined using a Wallac multilabel counter (Perkin-Elmer), and the signal intensity was plotted versus drug concentration. The concentration of drug resulting in 50% inhibition of the maximum signal was determined, and this value is reported as the IC50.  Focus formation assay. ErbB2 cDNA containing a COOH-terminal FLAG tag was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pRV2 vector to yield the pRV2-ErbB2 construct. Individual mutations associated with drug resistance were introduced into the kinase domain of ErbB2 by site-directed mutagenesis as described above. Retrovirus production was done as described above. NIH-3T3 cells were infected with retrovirus as described above for Ba/F3 cells. To select retroviral-infected cells, puromycin was added 24 h after infection at a concentration of 1.2 ng/mL. Cells were harvested at ∼70% confluency and plated in T75 flasks. Growth mode was documented by observation and photography, as cells were allowed to grow to ∼95% confluency. Afterwards, the cells were lysed and genomic DNA was isolated. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing PCR products generated with primers directed against ErbB2 as described above.  Western blot analysis. Ba/F3 cells (3 × 106) in 9.7 mL of serum-free RPMI 1640 without IL-3 were plated per well in a 12-well tissue culture plate. Cells were incubated 2 h at 37°C, at which time 30 μL of lapatinib or EXEL-7647 (serum-free RPMI 1640 without IL-3) were added to each well for final concentrations of 30,000, 10,000, 3,300, 1,100, 370, 123, 41, 14, 5, and 0 nmol/L. Cells were collected by centrifugation 1 h after compound addition, washed with ice-cold PBS, and added to cell lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/mL aprotinin, 5 mg/mL leupeptin, 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I (Sigma)]. A protease inhibitor cocktail [1 Complete Mini with EDTA (Roche) per 10 mL] was added to the lysis buffer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). NuPAGE SDS sample buffer (4×) and 10× NuPAGE sample reducing agent (Invitrogen) were added to lysates, which were then denatured for gel loading by incubation at 70°C for 10 min. Samples were loaded onto 4% to 12% NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris gels and subjected to electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose according to the manufacturers' instructions (Invitrogen).  Protein blots were probed with antibodies against phosphorylated ErbB2 (pErbB2; Cell Signaling), FLAG (Sigma) for measurement of total ErbB2, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK; Cell Signaling), and ERK (Cell Signaling). Horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used for detection of primary antibodies, with the exception of the FLAG antibody, which was directly coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Horseradish peroxidase was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence plus chemiluminescent substrate and a Typhoon imager (both from GE Healthcare).  Computer structural modeling. ErbB2 wild-type (WT) and mutant protein structures were generated using the homology modeling tools associated with MOE (version 2006.08; Chemical Computing Group). Template structures included both public [Protein Data Bank codes: 1M17 (36), 1XKK (37), 2GS6 (38), and 2GS7 (38)] and proprietary EGFR crystal structures. Ligand docking experiments used Glide (version 4.5) available from Schrodinger. Molecular graphics were created using PyMOL (version 0.98; DeLano Scientific LLC).  Results  Identification of ErbB2 mutations associated with lapatinib resistance. Ba/F3 cells can be engineered to grow in the absence of IL-3 by transgenic expression of kinases that promote cytokine-independent activation of growth and survival signal transduction pathways. For example, BCR-ABL expression induces STAT phosphorylation and signaling to confer cytokine-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells (34). In our studies, Ba/F3 cells were made to express the V659E mutant of ErbB2 by retroviral infection of a cytomegalovirus promoter–driven ErbB2 V659E expression clone, and infected cells showed robust growth in the absence of exogenous cytokine. The V659E mutant of ErbB2 was selected because it is a well-characterized mutation in the transmembrane domain of ErbB2 known to confer constitutive kinase activity and transform NIH-3T3 cells (39, 40). The ErbB2 V659E expression clone was subjected to random mutagenesis by passaging the vector in DNA repair–deficient E. coli. DNA sequence analysis determined the mutation frequency of the mutagenized ErbB2 expression library to be 4.35 × 10−5/bp. This ErbB2 V659E random mutation library was expressed in Ba/F3 cells by retroviral infection and screened for mutations that sustained lapatinib-resistant growth (Fig. 1 ).  Fig. 1. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Fig. 1. Schematic of the in vitro screen for ErbB2 drug resistance–associated mutations. An ErbB2 V659E expression construct was subjected to random mutagenesis. Cells expressing mutated ErbB2 that survived and grew in the presence of lapatinib or EXEL-7647 concentrations that prevented growth of cells expressing unmutagenized ErbB2 were selected and resistance-associated mutations were identified by DNA sequencing. The ErbB2 resistance-associated mutations were cloned and expressed in Ba/F3 cells to confirm that drug resistance was conferred by the detected mutation. Following stable expression of the mutated ErbB2 protein, survival IC50 values for all mutations and phosphorylation IC50 values for selected mutations were determined from 10-point dose-response assays. Ba/F3 cells expressing randomly mutated ErbB2 survived and grew in the presence of various lapatinib concentrations (400, 600, 800, and 1,200 nmol/L) that prevented growth of unmutagenized ErbB2-expressing cells. Multiple independent rounds of screening for resistance-associated mutations were completed in soft agar medium without IL-3. Amino acid substitution mutations were identified by DNA sequencing in 122 of 125 colonies selected by lapatinib-resistant growth. In the lapatinib-resistant Ba/F3 clones, 17 different single amino acid substitutions were identified at 16 amino acid locations (Table 1 ; Fig. 2 ). Mutations were isolated repeatedly in multiple independent clones, which indicated that screening saturation was achieved. Two of the 17 amino acid substitutions have been identified in clinical tumors at a low frequency; however, these mutations were not previously associated with drug resistance. L755S was reported in gastric and breast tumors, and T733I was reported in gastric tumors (29). Mutations were most prevalent in the ErbB2 kinase domain (12 of the 17 mutations). The remaining five mutations were found in the juxtamembrane domain (three), extracellular domain (one), and COOH-terminal domain (one) of ErbB2.  View inlineView popup Table 1.

Functional domains are indicated. Seventeen different single amino acid substitutions, which map to 16 ErbB2 amino acid residues, are marked at the corresponding sequence positions. L785F was identified in both lapatinib and EXEL-7647 screens. B, amino acids where resistance-associated substitution mutations were identified are shown on an ErbB2 structural model. The model shown is an inactive form of the ErbB2 kinase domain with lapatinib docked in the ATP-binding site. The box shows a magnification of the ATP-binding region. Blue, activation loop; cyan, Cα-helix; green, nucleotide-binding loop; red, NH2-terminal extension; pink, COOH-terminal extension. Lapatinib-resistant colonies were also isolated that contained double and triple ErbB2 mutation combinations. In addition to the 17 mutations we report identified as single mutations, 10 unique amino acid substitutions were discovered in different double and triple mutation combinations. The mutations were believed to be passengers rather than resistance driver mutations because each of the 10 mutations was identified in combinations that included a mutation discovered independently in singlet form. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these additional mutations may also enhance the overall fitness of ErbB2 kinase activity.  Resistance mutation cloning and cell expression recapitulates drug resistance. The ErbB2 resistance-associated mutations identified in screens of the ErbB2 random mutation library were cloned and expressed in Ba/F3 cells to confirm that lapatinib resistance was conferred by the detected mutation. Following stable expression of the mutated ErbB2 protein, lapatinib survival IC50 values for all mutations were determined from a 10-point dose-response cell viability assay (Table 1). Lapatinib survival IC50 values were >1,000 nmol/L for 6 of 17 mutations and >400 nmol/L for 11 of 17 mutations. The highest survival IC50 values, which correspond to the highest levels of drug resistance, were found for mutations isolated most frequently in our screens. ErbB2 T798I, isolated in 35 independent clones, showed the highest lapatinib survival IC50 with a value of 3,339 nmol/L. Lapatinib-induced non–ErbB2-mediated toxicity is ∼3,000 nmol/L in parental Ba/F3 cells; hence, the 3,339 nmol/L IC50 for survival of ErbB2 T798I–expressing Ba/F3 cells in the presence of lapatinib suggests that lapatinib-induced cell death was independent of ErbB2 inhibition for these cells. Mutations that conferred lapatinib viability IC50 values near the level of ErbB2-independent cytotoxicity were T798I, L755S, and S783P. Additional ErbB2 mutations associated with lapatinib viability IC50 values >1,000 nmol/L were L726F, P780L, and L785F (Table 1). Recently, it was reported that ErbB2 L726I causes resistance to gefitinib (41).  In contrast, the EGFR/ErbB2/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor EXEL-7647 was found to inhibit mutant forms of ErbB2 associated with lapatinib resistance. EXEL-7647 cell viability IC50 values were <555 nmol/L for all 17 ErbB2 mutations and were <400 nmol/L for 13 of 17 mutations. The highest EXEL-7647 viability IC50 was associated with the L785F mutation (554 nmol/L; Table 1). EXEL-7647 viability IC50 values for the identified ErbB2 mutations were consistent with results from resistance screens. In multiple independent screens using EXEL-7647, viable cells were difficult to isolate. Several cell colonies were formed in the presence of 600 nmol/L EXEL-7647 and found to express the L785F substitution, which was also identified repeatedly in lapatinib resistance mutation screens. Notably, repeated screen attempts were unable to discover any ErbB2 mutations associated with EXEL-7647 resistance and lapatinib sensitivity.  Sustained ErbB2 phosphorylation in cells expressing ErbB2 resistance-associated mutations correlates with cell viability. To investigate the mechanism of drug resistance associated with the ErbB2 mutations, levels of ErbB2 expression were examined and phosphorylation IC50 values for selected mutations were determined from a 10-point dose-response Western blot analysis (Table 2 ; Fig. 3 ). The expression level of ErbB2 was not correlated with drug resistance. In general, alignment between survival and phosphorylation IC50 values was observed, and ErbB2 and ERK phosphorylation IC50 values agreed; however, most phosphorylation IC50 values were elevated compared with survival IC50 values. Lapatinib ErbB2 phosphorylation IC50 values were 3,610 and 3,918 nmol/L for L755S and L785F resistance-associated mutations, which have survival IC50 values of 2,861 and 1,154 nmol/L, respectively. The lapatinib ErbB2 phosphorylation IC50 for the T798I mutation was >30,000 nmol/L, which was consistent with a survival IC50 value independent of ErbB2 inhibition. EXEL-7647 ErbB2 phosphorylation IC50 values for T798I and L785F mutations were 3,267 and 3,341 nmol/L, respectively. The basis for elevated ErbB2 phosphorylation IC50 values compared with the cytokine-independent cell survival IC50 values is not clear but could include differences in assay sensitivity and kinetics. The phosphorylation data indicate that <50% inhibition of ErbB2 activity is required for inhibition of cell survival in the absence of IL-3 and that survival is correlated with ErbB2 kinase activity.

Expression of mutant ErbB2 in Ba/F3 cells and determination of phosphorylation IC50 values. Ba/F3 cells selected for stable expression of resistance-associated mutations were used for ErbB2 and ERK phosphorylation IC50 determination. Cells were transferred to medium without serum or IL-3 2 h before compound addition. Following 1-h compound treatment (30,000, 10,000, 3,300, 1,100, 370, 123, 41, 14, 5, and 0 nmol/L), cells were harvested for Western blot analysis of pErbB2, total ErbB2 (FLAG), pERK, and total ERK. IC50 values were determined from a 10-point lapatinib or EXEL-7647 dose response. Western blot images of pErbB2, ErbB2, and pERK from cells expressing ErbB2 V659E, ErbB2 V659E_T798I, ErbB2 V659E_L785F, or ErbB2 V659E_L755S. IC50 values for pErbB2 were calculated using pErbB2 intensity after normalization to total ErbB2 levels. IC50 values for pERK were calculated using pERK intensity after normalization to total actin levels (data not shown). At least two immunoblot experiments were completed, and representative data are shown. The decreased ErbB2 protein level observed with 30 μmol/L EXEL-7647 treatments was associated with cell death (this effect was diminished in some samples by normalized protein loading). The most frequently identified ErbB2 mutation to confer lapatinib resistance, T798I, is a residue of highly conserved function in protein kinases. The amino acid in this position has become known as the gatekeeper residue because of its location near the ATP-binding site and association with drug resistance in multiple protein kinases, including EGFR, BCR-ABL, and cKIT (42). Mutations at the analogous residue in BCR-ABL and cKIT have been discovered in clinical tumors that are highly resistant to imatinib (2, 6). Similarly, mutation of the EGFR gatekeeper residue has been discovered in association with resistance to erlotinib and gefitinib in non–small cell lung tumors (13, 14). The ErbB2 T798I–expressing Ba/F3 cells survive and grow in the presence of lapatinib up to concentrations that cause toxicity that is unrelated to ErbB2 inhibition, and have corresponding IC50 values for survival (3,339 nmol/L) and ErbB2 phosphorylation (>30,000 nmol/L; Table 2; Fig. 3). The lapatinib resistance associated with ErbB2 T798I parallels the EGFR T790M resistance profile for gefitinib, erlotinib, and lapatinib. Lapatinib resistance to EGFR T790M and EGFR L777F, which is homologous to ErbB2 L785F, was shown by cloning and expression of the mutated EGFR variants in 293 cells for EGFR autophosphorylation analysis. Lapatinib was unable to inhibit EGFR T790M or L777F; autophosphorylation IC50 values were >30,000 nmol/L for both mutations (data not shown).  An inactive conformation of the ErbB2 Cα-helix is required for lapatinib binding. By analogy with the structure of EGFR, lapatinib is expected to bind competitively with ATP in the ErbB2 nucleotide-binding pocket (37). To correlate resistance mutations with lapatinib binding, structural models of the ErbB2 kinase domain were constructed using crystal structures of the homologous EGFR (36). Lapatinib binding is compatible only with an inactive conformation of the ErbB2 kinase in which the Cα-helix is positioned away from the nucleotide-binding pocket with the Glu-Lys salt bridge not formed (Fig. 4A ). The structural model suggests that amino acid changes near the ATP-binding pocket that introduce direct steric interference with lapatinib binding, or changes that promote movement of the Cα-helix into the nucleotide-binding pocket (which is required for kinase activation) can block binding of lapatinib to ErbB2.  Fig. 4. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Fig. 4. Lapatinib binds an inactive ErbB2 conformation and mutations that introduce steric interference or promote stability of the active kinase conformation can cause resistance. A, lapatinib is shown docked into inactive (left) and active (right) conformations of the ErbB2 structural model. In the active conformation, the Cα-helix (cyan) Glu-Lys salt bridge is formed, and the Cα-helix is positioned closer to the ATP-binding pocket where it clashes with lapatinib. Blue, activation loop. B, resistance-associated mutations predicted to cause lapatinib resistance by steric interference with lapatinib binding are shown. The amino acid mutation replaces a WT side chain in proximity to the ligand binding area with a bulkier side chain that interferes with lapatinib binding in the structural model. ErbB2 mutations associated with the highest lapatinib resistance clustered in the NH2-terminal kinase lobe and hinge region and included L726F, L755S, P780L, S783P, L785F, and T798I. The L726F, L785F, S783P, and T798I mutations are expected to act by direct steric interference (Fig. 4B). The L726F and L785F mutations replace the aliphatic side chain of leucine with the rigid, bulkier phenylalanine side chain. The threonine to isoleucine substitution at T798 results in increased bulk and loss of a polar oxygen atom. ErbB2 residues L726F and S783P associated with lapatinib resistance have spatially homologous residues in the ABL kinase associated with imatinib resistance: L248R, Q252H (ErbB2 L726), and V299L (ErbB2 S783).  Mutations at L755S or P780L are expected to directly shift the activation state dynamics to favor a conformation where the Cα-helix is positioned to block lapatinib binding, and represent the class of mutations believed to cause resistance by constraining kinase conformational flexibility. The leucine at L755 is predicted to participate in hydrophobic interactions with leucine residues of the activation loop. Substitution of the nonpolar leucine side chain with the smaller, polar serine group is expected to disrupt hydrophobic activation loop packing interactions that result in destabilization of an inactive conformation required for lapatinib binding. Structural modeling was unable to suggest a specific mechanism for the resistance associated with several mutations, such as C630Y, E717K, E719K/E719G, Y803N, E812K, D821N, and S1002R. These mutations may restrict conformational flexibility or otherwise affect the structure such that the inactive conformations required for lapatinib binding are unfavorable.  ErbB2 mutations are associated with lapatinib resistance and cellular transformation. To assess the transforming capability of kinase domain mutations associated with lapatinib resistance, the mutations were cloned and expressed in the absence of the V659E activating mutation and investigated for the ability to induce foci in vitro. Mutants that activate ErbB2 and promote oncogenic transformation have an intrinsic mechanism for growth selection before the tumor is exposed to selective pressure with an ErbB2 inhibitor. Resistance-associated mutations identified in our studies that also are associated with kinase activation and oncogenic transformation may have particular clinical relevance.  Resistance-associated mutations that mapped to the kinase domain were expressed individually in the context of an otherwise WT ErbB2 amino acid sequence and analyzed for focus formation in NIH-3T3 cells. Assays were conducted with cells stably expressing WT or mutated ErbB2 protein, which were constructed by infection of 3T3 cells with retrovirus expressing ErbB2. Cells expressing mutated ErbB2 variants were sequenced to confirm the mutation status. NIH-3T3 cells grew in a monolayer in the absence of ErbB2 transgene expression (Fig. 5A ) but formed foci of aggregated, transformed cells when expressing ErbB2 V659E (Fig. 5B), in accordance with published data (39, 40). WT ErbB2 had no effect on the formation of foci with NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 5C). The T798I mutant, which was the most frequently observed mutation in screens done with lapatinib, also failed to transform NIH-3T3 cells in this assay. We also constructed the analogous EGFR T790M variant and found that it too was not transforming (data not shown).  Fig. 5. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Fig. 5. ErbB2 drug resistance–associated mutations are transforming in NIH-3T3 cells. Mutations identified by DNA sequencing in lapatinib-resistant cells were introduced into WT ErbB2 expression constructs by site-directed mutagenesis to resynthesize the resistance-associated mutations in the absence of the V659E primary mutation. The mutant ErbB2 constructs were expressed in NIH-3T3 cells and stable expressing cells were selected. Cells were grown to confluence. Growth mode was documented by observation and photography. A, uninfected NIH-3T3 cells grow to confluence and form a monolayer. B, NIH-3T3 cells expressing ErbB2 V659E fail to reach confluence and form foci of piled-up cells. C, NIH-3T3 cells expressing WT ErbB2 grow to confluence and form a monolayer as observed for uninfected cells. D, NIH-3T3 cells expressing ErbB2 L755S fail to reach confluence and form foci of piled-up cells as observed for ErbB2 V659E. In contrast, NIH-3T3 cells expressing the L755S mutant form of ErbB2, which was associated with high-level lapatinib resistance, formed growth foci comparable with ErbB2 V659E (Fig. 5D). The transformation effect of ErbB2 L755S on NIH-3T3 cell growth was consistent with structural modeling results showing L755 participates in hydrophobic packing interactions that stabilize the kinase activation loop in an inactive conformation. Additional mutations associated with lapatinib resistance that were active in NIH-3T3 cell foci formation were T733I and D821N, although the appearance of foci with T733I or D821N occurred less frequently than with L755S or V659E. The T733I and D821N mutations were considered weakly transforming in our assay. The observation that L755S and T733I are transforming mutations associated with clinical tumors and in vitro lapatinib resistance provides evidence that our screen discovered ErbB2 mutations that may have clinical relevance for drug resistance.  Discussion  Our studies investigated ErbB2 mutations that cause resistance to kinase inhibition by lapatinib. A Ba/F3 cell-based system that required ErbB2 kinase activity for cell viability was engineered and used to screen a library of random ErbB2 mutations. This approach has been used with success by others to screen for mutations associated with BCR-ABL resistance to imatinib and dasatinib (34) as well as FLT3 resistance to PKC-412 (43). Our ErbB2 mutation screens revealed 17 different ErbB2 amino acid substitutions, involving 16 different residues associated with lapatinib resistance. EXEL-7647 was found to have significant activity against most of the mutations associated with lapatinib resistance, and ErbB2 mutations associated with EXEL-7647 resistance and lapatinib sensitivity were not discovered in multiple independent screen attempts.  The chemical structure and mode of drug binding to a kinase influence the vulnerability of a kinase inhibitor to target-directed mutational resistance (5). Drugs such as lapatinib and imatinib that are restricted to binding an inactive structural conformation of the kinase have increased susceptibility to resistance mutations because mutations that shift the conformational dynamics to favor an active conformation confer resistance. In our studies, the ErbB2 L755S mutation illustrates resistance via restriction of kinase conformational flexibility. Structural modeling of WT ErbB2 predicts that L755 makes tight hydrophobic interactions with activation loop leucine side chains that stabilize an inactive kinase conformation. Serine at residue 755 would disrupt hydrophobic packing and alter the thermodynamic equilibrium to favor a conformation in which the activation loop and Cα-helix adopt positions required for kinase activity and that are incompatible with lapatinib binding. L755S was associated with high levels of lapatinib resistance, marked by IC50 values >3,000 nmol/L in both cell viability and ErbB2 autophosphorylation assays.  Mutations that act via direct steric interference to prevent drug binding can cause resistance to drugs that bind to both active and inactive kinase structural conformations. In the case of ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors, mutations that block drug binding by steric interference must not impair ATP-binding or kinase activity. The gatekeeper residue of protein kinases, located at the boundary of the ATP-binding region, is the canonical site of amino acid substitution representing this class of resistance-associated mutation (42). In our studies, the T798I ErbB2 gatekeeper mutation was the most frequently identified mutation in lapatinib resistance screens and was associated with the highest level of lapatinib resistance. Lapatinib failed to inhibit ErbB2 T798I autophosphorylation at a 30,000 nmol/L concentration, and lapatinib-induced death of Ba/F3 cells expressing ErbB2 T798I was independent of ErbB2 inhibition. A T790M mutation at the analogous residue in EGFR is associated with clinical resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib. ErbB2 T798I and EGFR T790M mutations have comparable levels of resistance to lapatinib and provide evidence that ErbB2 T798I may have clinical relevance for lapatinib resistance. EXEL-7647 was shown previously to inhibit the EGFR T790M variant (23): in the present study, we also show that ErbB2 T798I is susceptible to inhibition by EXEL-7647.  The resistance-associated mutation profiles for lapatinib-ErbB2 and imatinib-BCR-ABL share important features, including the association of numerous mutations with resistance to each drug and two general mechanisms of action for resistance-associated mutations: direct steric interference with drug binding and shifting conformational equilibrium toward the active state. Both lapatinib and imatinib bind exclusively to the inactive conformations of ErbB2 and ABL kinases, respectively, and this conformational dependence most likely confers resistance susceptibility to multiple mutations that promote the active conformation. In contrast to lapatinib and imatinib, EXEL-7647 inhibits both active and inactive kinase conformations and inhibits mutant forms of ErbB2 associated with lapatinib resistance. Although multiple determinants influence whether kinase mutations confer resistance to small-molecule inhibitors, including drug potency and binding kinetics, our findings support the conclusion that kinase inhibitors limited to binding inactive kinase conformations are likely to have increased susceptibility to target-associated resistance mutations (15).  The clinical relevance of the mutations discovered in our in vitro screen will be tested as ErbB2 inhibitors such as lapatinib gain use as clinical therapeutics. Lapatinib was recently approved as a second-line therapy in combination with capecitabine in HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer (33, 44), although no data are yet available on clinical resistance to lapatinib involving ErbB2 mutations. Two lapatinib-resistant mutants discovered in our screen, L755S and T733I, have been identified previously in breast and gastric tumors and thus are examples of established cancer-associated mutations. Three mutations from our resistance screen, including L755S and T733I, were shown to be transforming in an in vitro foci formation growth assay, presenting evidence that the resistance-associated mutations can play a driving role in tumor growth phenotypes and have the capacity to arise as primary tumor-associated resistance mutations. However, the T798I variant (the most frequent mutation recovered in screens with lapatinib) did not have transforming properties nor did the analogous T790M mutation in EGFR. The T790M EGFR mutation has been described as having enhanced kinase activity and providing a proliferative advantage in cells overexpressing this variant (45). Our data suggest that this enhanced activity is not sufficient to be transforming by itself, although the profound resistance to lapatinib conferred by this substitution leads to strong selective pressure in the resistance screens. Consistent with this, it was recently reported that EGFR T790M does not transform NIH-3T3 cells, although it shows relatively modest enhancement of kinase activity that dramatically potentiates other activating mutations in EGFR (46).  It is unknown how the level of kinase activation required for activity in the in vitro foci formation assay relates to the degree of activation needed for tumor-associated growth selection in the absence of a kinase inhibitor. The level of kinase activation that confers a tumor growth advantage, and enables subpopulations of tumor cells with resistance-associated mutations to exist before inhibitor-induced selection, likely will vary with the genetic complexity of tumors. Our in vitro foci formation assay did not attempt to model the genetic complexity and diversity of human tumors, and formation of foci in our assay may be expected to require a higher level of kinase activation than that needed to affect growth of human tumors with complex genetic alterations. Consequently, it remains plausible that resistance-associated mutations failing to induce NIH-3T3 cell foci formation in vitro may activate kinase activity and affect human tumor growth phenotypes.  The diversity of mutations identified in our screens and the absence of nonmutation-associated resistance indicates that ErbB2 mutation may be a prominent mechanism for ErbB2-driven tumors to evade inhibition by lapatinib. Nonmutation mechanisms for drug resistance have been described for kinase inhibition, including ErbB2 and EGFR inhibitors, and do provide alternate survival pathways for tumors to evade therapeutic efficacy. Activation of estrogen receptor has been implicated in resistance to lapatinib, and lapatinib has been shown to induce estrogen receptor expression in patients receiving lapatinib therapy (47). Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling via PTEN loss (48–51) or increased ErbB3 transphosphorylation (52) has also been shown to confer resistance to ErbB2 inhibition. Similarly, activation of cMET by gene amplification activates ErbB3 signaling and provides an escape mechanism to EGFR inhibition by gefitinib that is sensitive to inhibitors of MET kinase activity (53). Restoration of PTEN activity or inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT (54), as well as inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (55), restores sensitivity in PTEN/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT–mediated resistance. The manifestation of clinical therapeutic resistance in tumors under ErbB2 drug therapy is likely to involve multiple pathways and will be dependent on the composite genetic makeup of the tumor and associated therapeutic selective pressure. Our studies show that kinase mutations can provide a facile resistance mechanism for the small-molecule ErbB2 inhibitor lapatinib, and describe a resistance-associated mutation profile for lapatinib involving mutations that result in high-level resistance and promote cellular neoplastic transformation in vitro.  EXEL-7647, a potent inhibitor of ErbB2, EGFR, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 receptor tyrosine kinases, retains activity against the broad spectrum of ErbB2 mutations that confer resistance to lapatinib inhibition. The L785F mutation was associated with the most significant resistance to EXEL-7647, and as observed for the other mutant forms of ErbB2 identified in our resistance screens, this mutant was more sensitive to EXEL-7647 than to lapatinib. EXEL-7647 binds both active and inactive conformations of ErbB2, which may allow EXEL-7647 to retain activity against mutations that promote kinase activation and contribute to the contrasting resistance mutation profiles for lapatinib and EXEL-7647. Based on the results reported here and in previous studies (23), we speculate that EXEL-7647 may be able to circumvent some of the target-associated resistance mechanisms associated with lapatinib.  We report a HER2T798I gatekeeper mutation in a patient with HER2L869R-mutant breast cancer with acquired resistance to neratinib. Laboratory studies suggested that HER2L869R is a neratinib-sensitive, gain-of-function mutation that upon dimerization with mutant HER3E928G, also present in the breast cancer, amplifies HER2 signaling. The patient was treated with neratinib and exhibited a sustained partial response. Upon clinical progression, HER2T798I was detected in plasma tumor cell-free DNA. Structural modeling of this acquired mutation suggested that the increased bulk of isoleucine in HER2T798I reduces neratinib binding. Neratinib blocked HER2-mediated signaling and growth in cells expressing HER2L869R but not HER2L869R/T798I. In contrast, afatinib and the osimertinib metabolite AZ5104 strongly suppressed HER2L869R/T798I-induced signaling and cell growth. Acquisition of HER2T798I upon development of resistance to neratinib in a breast cancer with an initial activating HER2 mutation suggests HER2L869R is a driver mutation. HER2T798I-mediated neratinib resistance may be overcome by other irreversible HER2 inhibitors like afatinib. SIGNIFICANCE:We found an acquired HER2 gatekeeper mutation in a patient with HER2-mutant breast cancer upon clinical progression on neratinib. We speculate that HER2T798I may arise as a secondary mutation following response to effective HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in other cancers with HER2-activating mutations. This resistance may be overcome by other irreversible HER2 TKIs, such as afatinib.

OF2 | CANCER DISCOVERY JUNE 2017 www.aacrjournals.org INTRODUCTION DNA-sequencing efforts have revealed that ERBB2, the gene encoding the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase, is mutated in a wide variety of cancer types, including 2% to 3% of primary breast cancers (1–3), with a higher incidence in lobular breast cancers (4). More than 70% of HER2 mutations in breast cancer are found in the absence of HER2 (ERBB2) gene amplification (2). Some of the common HER2 mutations promote HER2 kinase activity and transform breast epithelial cells and other cell types (5–9). Given that irreversible EGFR/ HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as neratinib and afatinib, have shown preclinical activity against several HER2 mutants (5, 7–9), clinical trials with neratinib (SUMMIT trial; NCT01953926) and afatinib (NCI-MATCH; NCT02465060) focused on patients with HER2-mutant cancers are in progress. However, sustained clinical activity of ATP mimetics in patients with advanced cancer has generally been limited by the acquisition of drug resistance. Mutation of the “gatekeeper” residue within the kinase’s ATP-binding pocket, such as ABLT315I, KITT670I, and EGFRT790M, is a common mechanism of acquired resistance. Here, we report for the first time a case of a HER2 gatekeeper mutation in a patient with nonamplified HER2-mutant breast cancer with acquired resistance to neratinib. RESULTS HER2L869R Exhibits a Gain-of-Function Phenotype That Is Blocked by Neratinib Targeted capture next-generation sequencing (NGS; ref. 10) of DNA from a skin metastasis in a 54-year-old female with estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)–positive, HER2 nonamplified lobular breast carcinoma identified an ERBB2L869R (HER2L869R) somatic mutation (Supplementary Table S1). Prior therapies included chemotherapy, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, everolimus, and trastuzumab. The tumor also harbored a truncation mutation in CDH1, ERBB3E928G, and amplification of CCND1 and FGF3/4/19. Interrogation of the cBioPortal (n > 21,000), Project GENIE (n > 18,000), the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC; n > 50,000), Foundation Medicine (n > 40,000), and Guardant Health (n > 17,000) databases found 16 additional cancers harboring ERBB2L869R and one L869Q mutation, including 12 breast cancers (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, a recent study reported four instances of ERBB2L869R among 413 invasive lobular breast cancers (4). The L869R mutation is located within the activation loop of the HER2 kinase domain. Sequence alignment of the HER2, EGFR, and BRAF kinase domains showed that HER2L869R is homologous to BRAFV600E, a gain-of-function mutation found in >50% of melanomas (11), and EGFRL861R/Q, an activating mutation in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; Fig.  1A; ref. 12). We performed structural modeling of the L869R mutation using Rosetta (13) and examined the residue pair energies involving L869. The mutation resulted in the addition of a strong attractive interaction between R869 and D769 (Fig. 1B and C). This interaction potentially stabilizes the active conformation of the C helix. We also predict that mutating L869 to a polar residue (Arg) disrupts the autoinhibitory contacts between the C helix and the activation loop helix, resulting in destabilization of the inactive conformation of the kinase, similar to EGFRL858R (14). On the basis of these structural data, we hypothesized that HER2L869R would display increased signaling and transforming capacity. To test this, we stably transduced MCF10A breast epithelial cells with lentiviral vectors encoding HER2 wild-type (WT) or HER2L869R. Cells expressing HER2L869R exhibited increased phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, and S6, which were blocked by neratinib (Fig. 1D). Phosphorylation of HER2WT, but not HER2L869R, was blocked by the reversible HER2/EGFR TKI lapatinib, whereas neratinib inhibited phosphorylation of both WT and mutant receptors. Expression of HER2L869R enhanced MCF10A cell proliferation in growth factor–depleted media (Fig.  1E) and colony formation in three-dimensional (3-D) Matrigel in the absence of EGF and insulin (Fig. 1F) compared with MCF10A/HER2WT cells. Growth of MCF10A/HER2L869R cells was inhibited by neratinib but not by lapatinib, whereas the HER2WT cells were sensitive to both TKIs. With these supporting data, the patient was enrolled in a clinical trial with single-agent neratinib (NCT01953926). Upon treatment, the patient exhibited an excellent clinical response, showing near disappearance of multiple skin metastases after 20 days (Fig. 1G), and a 77% reduction in marker lesions by RECIST criteria after 8 weeks. Because the patient harbored a co-occurring ERBB3E928G mutation, a known activating mutation in HER3 (15), we next asked whether HER2L869R and HER3E928G might co-operate to drive HER2 signaling. Mutations in ERBB2 and ERBB3 often co-occur in cancer. In the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Project GENIE dataset (>18,000 sequenced tumors), 8.3% of ERBB2-mutated cancers also harbor mutations in ERBB3, whereas only 2.3% of ERBB2 WT cancers have ERBB3 mutations (q value = 1.3 × 10−10; www.cbioportal.org/ genie). ERBB2L869R and ERBB3E928G were found to co-occur in another breast cancer case in the METABRIC dataset (16). Structural modeling of the HER2L869R/HER3E928G double mutant predicted that the HER3 mutation, located at the dimer interface, may enhance heterodimerization of the kinase domains through decreased bulk and electrostatic repulsion (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Calculating the change in free energy of WT heterodimers compared with mutant heterodimers demonstrated a significant difference in the capacity of the latter to bind to one another (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Furthermore, coexpression of the HER2L869R and HER3E928G intracellular domains resulted in enhanced transphosphorylation of HER3 and ERK as substrates compared with that induced by expression of either mutant alone (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Phosphorylation of mutant HER2 and HER3, as well as the elevated downstream signaling induced by the expression of both mutants, was blocked by treatment with neratinib (Supplementary Fig.  S1D). These data suggest that these cooccurring mutations in ERBB2 and ERBB3 enhance ERBB signaling output, which, in turn, can be blocked by neratinib. Acquired HER2T798I Mediates Neratinib Resistance After 5 months on therapy, the patient developed a painful metastasis in the sternum. The addition of the ER antagonist fulvestrant to neratinib induced a prompt symptomatic and clinical response. After 10 additional months on the combination, the patient progressed with new skin metastases. Targeted Research.

OF4 | CANCER DISCOVERY JUNE 2017 www.aacrjournals.org tissue-based NGS analysis of DNA from a new skin metastasis and plasma tumor, cell-free DNA (cfDNA; Guardant360) revealed that ERBB2L869R remained (44% allele frequency and 8.7% cfDNA, respectively; Supplementary Table S3). ERBB3E928G remained in the post-treatment biopsy as well. ERBB2T798I was found in plasma (1.3% cfDNA), but not in DNA from the synchronous skin metastasis. Additional single-gene deep sequencing of plasma ERBB2 using two rounds of targeted capture (average >4,000 reads per sample) in an independent plasma sample from that used for the Guardant360 test failed to identify ERBB2T798I in any of the plasma samples obtained at study enrollment or during the first 9 cycles of neratinib, but increased to 1.0% of reads at the time of clinical progression (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S4). In contrast, ERBB2L869R was detected in 6.8% of reads in the pretreatment sample, decreasing considerably during therapy, and rebounding up to 15.2% at progression. These data suggest that ERBB2T798I was acquired during neratinib therapy. HER2T798I is homologous to EGFRT790M and imatinibresistant KITT670I in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Fig. 2B). EGFRT790M drives resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs in NSCLC by two mechanisms: first, by mediating steric hindrance of ATP-competitive drugs, and second, by increasing the affinity of ATP, resulting in enhanced phosphotransfer and kinase activity (17). To determine whether HER2T798I functions in a similar manner, we constructed computational models of HER2WT and HER2T798I bound to neratinib. We found that the increased bulk of the isoleucine at position 798 would result in steric hindrance when neratinib binds (Fig.  2C). The closest approach between nonhydrogen atoms from residue T798 to neratinib is 4.1 Å in HER2WT, whereas this distance is reduced to 3.6 Å in HER2T798I, resulting in a reduced size of the binding pocket. Therefore, the isoleucine substitution at position 798 is expected to reduce neratinib binding. Next, we asked whether the T798I mutation would block neratinib action. HEK293 cells transfected with HER2WT, HER2L869R, HER2T798I, or HER2L869R/T798I (both mutations in cis) were treated with increasing doses of neratinib for 4 hours. Low doses of neratinib (20 nmol/L) blocked pHER2, pAKT, and pERK in cells expressing HER2WT or HER2L869R, but not in cells expressing HER2T798I or HER2L869R/T798I treated with up to 180 nmol/L neratinib (Fig. 2D). To confirm these findings, we stably transduced MCF10A cells with WT and mutant HER2. We noted that HER2T798I and HER2T798I/L869R were poorly expressed in HEK293 and MCF10A cells (Fig. 2D and E). Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 24 hours restored expression of the T798I mutants (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that this mutation decreases protein stability. Cells expressing HER2L869R or HER2L869R/T798I, but not HER2T798I alone, displayed enhanced pAKT, pERK, and pS6 (Fig.  2E). Furthermore, although HER2L869R and HER2L869R/T798I induced EGF-independent MCF10A cell proliferation, HER2T798I did not (Fig.  2F). Although untreated MCF10A/HER2L869R/T798I cells did not proliferate as fast as cells expressing HER2L869R, they were the only cells that grew in the presence of neratinib. A similar slow growth rate has been reported in EGFR TKI–resistant cell lines and patients’ tumors harboring EGFRT790M (18). MCF10A cells expressing both mutations displayed reduced sensitivity to neratinib (IC50 = 154 nmol/L) compared with cells expressing HER2L869R (IC50 = 23.9 nmol/L; Fig. 2G). These results suggest that, like EGFRT790M for gefitinib and erlotinib, HER2T798I confers a growth advantage in the presence of neratinib. The lack of transforming capacity of HER2T798I alone suggests that it is not a driver oncogene, but an acquired alteration as a result of therapeutic pressure. Consistent with this speculation, HER2T798I is exceedingly rare in tumors from patients not treated with HER2 TKIs (Supplementary Table S2). Of all of the tumors sequenced in the cBioPortal, COSMIC, Foundation Medicine, and Guardant Health databases (more than 100,000 samples sequenced in all), HER2T798I was found in only one colorectal cancer cell line (Foundation Medicine) and one endometrial cancer cell line (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia), strongly suggesting that in the patient reported herein, T798I was acquired due to selective pressure of neratinib treatment. We next examined a panel of other irreversible EGFR/ HER2 TKIs for their ability to block HER2L869R/T798I. These included afatinib, a covalent EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib (AZD9291), which exhibits selectivity against mutant EGFR (including T790M) but does not block WT HER2 (19), and AZ5104, an osimertinib metabolite that inhibits WT HER2 and EGFR (20). We performed computational modeling of HER2L869R/T798I bound to neratinib, afatinib, osimertinib, and AZ5104 (Fig.  3A–D). These small molecules are expected to bind HER2 using the same mechanism and position by which they bind EGFR. By analogy with EGFR, the HER2 kinase is predicted to adopt distinct conformations when bound by each inhibitor. Afatinib and neratinib have covalent binding modes that project deeply into the Figure 2.  HER2T798I induces acquired resistance to neratinib. A, The patient’s plasma was drawn at the time of clinical trial screening (SCR) and the indicated cycles of neratinib therapy (1 cycle = 28 days). Plasma cfDNA was subjected to ERBB2 targeted capture and sequenced. B, The amino acid sequences of human KIT, ERBB2, and EGFR were aligned using Clustal Omega. KITT670, ERBB2T798, and EGFRT790 gatekeeper residues are highlighted in yellow. C, The structure of HER2WT and a model of HER2T798I are shown with neratinib bound to the kinase pocket. The threonine (WT) or isoleucine (mutant) residue at position 798 is shown in pink.

The sterically larger side chain of HER2T798I decreases the available space and decreases the polar character of the binding pocket. This is predicted to affect neratinib binding, which, by being the largest of these small molecules, extends the deepest into the pocket. Although afatinib is predicted to make slight contact with T798I, it does not insert as far into the tunnel as neratinib does. Osimertinib and AZ5104 are predicted to bind much less deeply on the lip of the pocket (Fig. 3C and D). On the basis of these studies, HER2T798I is predicted to disrupt neratinib binding, but is not expected to significantly affect the binding of afatinib, osimertinib, or AZ5104. We next tested the ability of the panel of inhibitors to block mutant HER2 in stably transduced NR6 mouse fibroblasts, which lack endogenous EGFR (21), and MCF10A cells. In both cell types, neratinib more efficiently blocked HER2 phosphorylation in cells expressing HER2WT or HER2L869R compared with cells expressing HER2L869R/T798I (Fig.  3E and F). Treatment with afatinib and AZ5104 blocked phosphorylation of HER2WT as well as both HER2 mutants. In contrast, osimertinib failed to inhibit HER2WT, HER2L869R, or HER2T798I. Inhibition of pAKT, pERK, and pS6 with all small molecules mirrored that of pHER2 in MCF10A cells (Fig. 3F). MCF10A/HER2L869R and MCF10A/HER2L869R/T798I were highly sensitive to afatinib and AZ5104 in growth factor–depleted media, whereas higher doses of osimertinib were required to block the growth of both cell types (Fig. 4A). Neratinib and AZ5104 showed similar IC50 values in HER2L869R-expressing cells, whereas neratinib was less effective against HER2L869R/T798I-expressing cells. In 3-D Matrigel, 100 nmol/L of neratinib, afatinib, or AZ5104 completely blocked acini formation by MCF10A/HER2L869R cells, whereas 100 nmol/L of osimertinib only slightly suppressed acini growth (Fig. 4B). Both neratinib and osimertinib failed to suppress growth of MCF10A/HER2L869R/T798I cells in 3-D Matrigel, whereas this was completely blocked by afatinib and AZ5104, suggesting that the latter two inhibitors are able to overcome HER2T798I-mediated drug resistance. Recent reports have proposed the acquisition of HER2 mutations in patients with HER2WT amplification treated with anti-HER2 therapies (22). In addition, neratinib has shown clinical activity and is being used in patients with HER2WT amplification (23). Thus, we tested whether a HER2 gatekeeper mutation would confer resistance to neratinib when present in a background of HER2WT amplification. We used HER2-amplified BT474 cells stably expressing HER2T798M, which we previously reported to be lapatinib resistant (24). BT474GFP control cells and BT474/HER2T798M cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), lapatinib, neratinib, afatinib, osimertinib, or AZ5104. Lapatinib failed to suppress pHER2, pAKT, pERK, and pS6 in HER2T798Mexpressing cells (Fig.  4C). Treatment with neratinib inhibited pHER2, pAKT, and pS6 in BT474GFP cells but not in BT474/HER2T798M cells. Consistent with the findings in MCF10A cells, afatinib and AZ5104, but not osimertinib, blocked pAKT, pERK, and pS6 in both BT474GFP and BT474/HER2T798M cells. As only approximately 3% of the ERBB2 alleles in the BT474/HER2T798M cells harbor the mutation (24), these data suggest that just a few HER2T798M alleles can confer resistance to neratinib, but not afatinib, in cells with HER2WT gene amplification. DISCUSSION We report herein the identification of a HER2T798I gatekeeper mutation in a patient with HER2-mutant, nonamplified breast cancer with acquired resistance to neratinib. Structural modeling showed that the T798I mutation results in a steric clash with neratinib, which would reduce drug binding. HER2T798I directly promoted resistance to neratinib in lentivirally transduced cell lines. In contrast to neratinib, afatinib and the metabolite of osimertinib, AZ5104, blocked HER2T798I-induced signaling and cell growth. Although the initial neratinib-sensitizing HER2L869R mutation induced constitutive phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, and S6 and displayed gain-of-function activity when expressed in breast epithelial cells (Fig. 1), we failed to observe increased phosphorylation of this mutant compared with HER2WT (Figs. 1D and 2D and E). We speculate that the L869R mutation likely removes autoinhibitory interactions, thus placing the kinase in a better position to interact with other ERBB receptors and adaptor proteins/downstream substrates (25, 26). Notably, the HER2-mutant cancer also harbored a known activating HER3E928G mutation (15). We speculate these comutations resulted in increased dependence on the ERBB pathway and contributed to the tumor’s initial sensitivity to neratinib. Consistent with this speculation, preliminary results from the SUMMIT trial show that among 17 patients who exhibited clinical benefit from neratinib, 2 patients harbored ERBB3 missense mutations, whereas none of the 25 patients who did not benefit harbored ERBB3 alterations in their cancer (27). Our findings parallel the identification of the EGFRT790M gatekeeper mutation in NSCLC resistant to EGFR inhibitors. We note that for EGFR, two nucleotides would need to be mutated to change the threonine codon at position 790 to an isoleucine [ACG (Thr) > ATA, ATC, or ATT (Ile)], whereas only one nucleotide change is needed for the T790M mutation (ACG > ATG). The opposite is true for ERBB2 [ACA (Thr) > ATA (Ile) vs. ACA > ATG (Met)]. Thus, it is easier for the tumor to mutate ERBB2 codon 798 to an isoleucine rather than a methionine. EGFRT790M is reported to promote resistance by simultaneously increasing ATP affinity and decreasing drug binding (28). Although our data suggest that the HER2T798I mutation could affect neratinib binding through steric interactions, it could similarly affect ATP binding and kinase activity. Although the change in distance (0.5 Å) from residue 798 to neratinib could theoretically be accommodated by conformational changes, the structural evidence suggests that replacing a polar amino acid (Thr) with a hydrophobic residue (Ile) would decrease ATP affinity. The WT Thr side chain contains an -OH group that faces the ATP-binding site. In the AMP-PNP–bound crystal structure of EGFR (2GS7.pdb), that -OH group is within 3.4 Å of the N6 of AMP-PNP. Replacing the Thr with Ile would remove that favorable interaction and is expected to decrease ATP affinity. These structural assessments are consistent with our cell-based findings that T798I-expressing cells do not show increased HER2 phosphorylation, even when corrected for expression levels (Fig. 2D and E). HER2T798I and EGFRT790M also differ in that the former is exceedingly rare in untreated tumors (Supplementary Research.

Table S2), whereas EGFRT790M also occurs in germline DNA and can promote lung cancer formation (29), suggesting that EGFRT790M itself is oncogenic. This is also consistent with the notion that HER2T798I alone is not oncogenic, but requires another activating mutation in cis (e.g., L869R) to promote HER2 signaling and oncogenic growth (Fig. 2). We previously reported that a HER2T798M gatekeeper mutation increased HER2 autophosphorylation and association of HER3 with the p85-regulatory subunit of PI3K (24). In the current study, HER2T798I alone did not appear to enhance HER2 signaling or HER2-induced proliferation more than HER2WT (Fig.  2E and F). This discrepancy may be due to differences in experimental conditions (i.e., serum starvation), differences between the Met and Ile residues, or lower expression of the mutant receptor compared with WT, which we observed in multiple cell lines expressing T798I alone or Research.

We speculate that the decreased expression of the mutant may be due to decreased protein stability (Supplementary Fig.  S2). Despite this decreased expression, MCF10A cells expressing HER2T798I/ L869R displayed increased phosphorylation of HER2 signaling targets and EGF-independent proliferation compared with MCF10A/HER2WT cells, as well as robust growth in the presence of neratinib (Figs. 2E–G and 4B), altogether suggesting that even low levels of HER2T798I can promote neratinib resistance. We are unable to determine whether ERBB2L869R and ERBB2T798I occur in cis in the patient’s plasma, as these two mutations are 213 bp apart, longer than the length of cfDNA fragments shed from tumor cells. In NSCLC, EGFRT790M is usually found on the same allele as the initial TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutation (30), suggesting that the two ERBB2 mutations may also occur in cis. In addition, the allele frequency of ERBB2T798I in plasma tumor cfDNA in the patient progressing on neratinib was lower than the frequency of ERBB2L869R (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S3) consistent with HER2L869R being the initial driver mutation, and HER2T798I representing an acquired subclonal drug-resistant mutation. A similar relationship is typically seen with somatic EGFRT790M in the plasma of patients progressing on EGFR inhibitors compared with the level of the original drug-sensitive EGFR mutation (31). We also note that HER2T798I was not found in a new skin metastasis synchronous with the progression on neratinib, suggesting spatially heterogeneous mechanisms of drug resistance. This finding is consistent with other reports where plasma may serve as a repository of different acquired drug-resistant mutations found in some but not all metastatic sites, whereas a tissue biopsy of a single lesion may produce a less complete picture, as suggested by studies with drug-resistant NSCLC expressing EGFRT790M. For example, a subset of patients with EGFR TKI–resistant NSCLC with EGFRT790M detected in plasma but not in a tumor biopsy still responded to osimertinib (32). PIK3CAM1043I, an activating mutation in the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K (33), was found at 0.1% frequency in the same plasma sample where HER2T798I was first detected (Supplementary Table S3). PIK3CA mutations are associated with resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in HER2- overexpressing breast cancers (34). Whether PIK3CAM1043I contributes to a multifactorial resistance to neratinib is also possible but beyond the scope of this report. Although afatinib and neratinib are both irreversible covalent EGFR/ HER2 TKIs, we found that afatinib, but not neratinib, was able to block HER2L869R/T798I activity. We speculate that because neratinib is larger than afatinib, the former is more likely to be affected by a steric clash with the bulkier isoleucine residue in HER2T798I (Fig. 3A and B). Treatment with low doses of afatinib (10 nmol/L), easily achievable in patients (35), completely blocked growth of MCF10A/ HER2L869R/T798I cells, whereas treatment with neratinib at clinically achievable concentrations (36) failed to do so (Fig. 4A and B). We also observed moderate activity of the osimertinib metabolite AZ5104 (Fig. 4). However, this drug is not being developed independently of osimertinib, and only approximately 10% of osimertinib is metabolized into AZ5104 in humans (20). Immediately following progression on neratinib, the patient was treated with capecitabine chemotherapy. The patient responded well and remains in a partial response approximately 1 year later. We repeated NGS of her plasma tumor DNA after approximately 6 months on capecitabine; ERBB2L869R cfDNA dropped to 0.4% and ERBB2T798I and CCND1 amplification were no longer detectable, consistent with the decrease in tumor burden and the patient’s clinical response. If the patient progresses on capecitabine and the ERBB2 mutations are once again detectable, there will be strong consideration for treatment with afatinib at that time. As more patients with HER2-mutant cancers are treated with HER2 TKIs such as neratinib, we expect that acquired HER2T798I may be observed more frequently. We propose that afatinib is active against HER2T798I and is an alternative worthy of clinical investigation in cancers harboring the HER2 gatekeeper mutation. Finally, this report supports the development of HER2T798I-selective inhibitors that would spare the toxicity associated with therapeutic inhibition of WT ERBB receptors.  
1344||The serine/threonine protein kinase encoded by the Akf proto-oncogene is catalytically inactive in serumstarved primary and immortalized fibroblasts. Here we show that Akt and the Akt-related kinase AKT2 are activated by PDGF. The activation was rapid and specific, and it was abrogated by mutations in the Akt Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The Akt activation was also shown to depend on PDGFRp tyrosines Y740 and Y751, which bind phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) upon phosphorylation. Moreover, Akt activation was blocked by the PI 3-kinase-specific inhibitor wortmannin and the dominant inhibitory N17Ras. Conversely, Akt activity was induced following the addition of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate to Akt immunoprecipitates from serum-starved cells in vitro. These results identify Akt as a novel target of PI 3-kinase and suggest that the Akt PH domain may be a mediator of PI 3-kinase signaling. Introduction Following ligand binding, tyrosine kinase receptors undergo dimerization leading to the activation of their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation. The tyrosine-phosphorylated regions of the receptor, in turn, function as high affinity binding sites for a series of Src homology 2 (SH2) domain- and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain-containing proteins (Cohen et al., 1995; Pawson, 1995), which, upon phosphorylation, transduce receptor-generated signals (Heldin, 1995). The receptor binding of these signaling proteins is site specific (Cohen et al., 1995; Pawson, 1995). Mutation of individual receptor autophosphorylation sites prevents the transduction of signals mediated by the molecules that bind to these sites 1:Present address: Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Taejon, Korea 305-606. (Valius and Kazlauskas, 1993). On the basis of these observations, it has been proposed that the unique specificity of individual receptors in a given cell type is determined by the sum of the activities of the signaling proteins that interact with the receptor in its tyrosine-phosphorylated form. Accordingly, the interaction of overlapping subsets of signaling proteins with different activated receptors initiates distinct, receptor-specific signaling cascades (Heldin, 1995). Mitogenic signals are transmitted from the activated tyrosine kinase receptors through several known pathways. One such pathway involves the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (Divecha and Irvine, 1995); another, the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK or ERK [for extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase]) (Marshall, 1995); a third, the phosphorylation and activation of the p70 s6k kinase (Downward, 1994); and a fourth, the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of a family of cytoplasmic transcription factors called STATs (for signal transducer and activator of transcription) (Heldin, 1995). Triggering these pathways depends on direct protein-protein interactions, posttranslational modifications, and the induction of second messenger molecules (Marshall, 1995; Divecha and Irvine, 1995). The synthesis of one class of such molecules involves the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol and its D-4- and D-5-phosphorylated derivatives in the D-3 position, in a reaction catalyzed by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (Kapeller and Cantley, 1994). Recent studies have shown that the PI 3-kinase exhibits both lipid and protein kinase activities (Kapeller and Cantley, 1994), activates the p70 s6k (Downward, 1994), and in many cell types, plays a critical role in mitogenic or other signaling (Kapeller and Cantley, 1994). Akt (or c-akt), the cellular homolog of the viral oncogene v-akt, encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that is ubiquitously expressed (Bellacosa et al., 1993) and whose catalytic domain is closely related to the catalytic domain of all the members of the PKC family (Bellacosa et al., 1991). Akt, however, differs from other PKC family members in that it contains an N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-147) (Akt homology [AH] domain) (Bellacosa et al., 1991, 1993; Franke et al., 1994), part of which (amino acids 1-106) is related to the Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, present in a large number of signaling molecules (Cohen et al., 1995). Recent studies from this laboratory have shown that the AH domain of Akt is a domain of protein-protein interaction that mediates the formation of Akt multimeric complexes and that the formation of these complexes is associated with protein kinase activation (Datta et al., 1995). Probing DNA from vertebrate and invertebrate species with an AH/PH domain probe revealed that Akt is a member of a conserved family of kinases (Cheng et al., 1992; Franke et al., 1994).

Of these genes, AKT2/RAC,8 is amplified in approximately 10% of human ovarian neoplasms (Cheng et al., 1992). In this paper, we present evidence that Akt is activated rapidly and specifically following exposure of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), NIH 3T3 cells, and Rat-1 cells to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The related kinases AKT2 and Daktl are also activated by PDGF. Genetic, pharmacological, and biochemical studies revealed that the transduction of PDG F-generated Akt activation signals depends on the activation of the PI 3-kinase and on the Akt AH/PH domain. In addition to defining a signal that activates the Akt kinase, these data also provide a function for the PI 3-kinase-generated D-3- phosphorylated phosphoinositides and suggest that the Akt AH/PH domain may be a mediator of PI 3-kinase signaling.  Results PDGF Induces Akt Kinase Activity Previous studies had shown that the murine serine/threonine protein kinase Akt is ubiquitously expressed (Bellacosa et al., 1993). However, Akt immunoprecipitated from serum-starved immortalized mouse and rat embryo fibroblasts (NIH 3T3 and Rat-1 cells) as well as primary MEFs is catalytically inactive. Since PDGF is one of the major mitogens in serum (Stiles et al., 1979), we examined whether PDGF induced Akt protein kinase activity in serum-starved cells. NIH 3T3 cells were exposed to PDGF-AB (50 ng/ml) following 24 hr of serum starvation. After 10 min, the cells were lysed, and Akt was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-Akt antiserum raised against a peptide composed of the 15 C-terminal amino acids of Akt (anti-AktCT). In parallel reactions, the immunoprecipitation of Akt was competed by excess immunizing peptide (1 I~M). Akt kinase activity was induced rapidly, following exposure to PDGF (Figure 1A, left). Moreover, Akt was activated by PDGF not only in NIH 3T3 but also in Rat-1 and MEF cells by using a similar protocol (Figure 1A, right). The end point in the assays, shown in Figure 1A, was the autophosphorylation of Akt. To identify a suitable exogenous substrate, we carried out in vitro kinase reactions of Akt immunoprecipitated from serum-starved or serumstarved and PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells by use of the panel of proteins shown in Figure 1B. Among six proteins compared in this experiment, histone H2B was the most sensitive and specific Akt substrate. The PDGF-induced kinase activity could be due to the activation of Akt or to the activation of a coprecipitating protein kinase. To distinguish between these possibilities, we constructed a kinase-defective Akt mutant in which the lysine of the ATP-binding site at position 179 (Bellacosa et al., 1993) was replaced by a methionine (Akt K179M). Expression constructs of wild-type and kinase-defective Akt carrying a hemagglutinin (HA)-derived N-terminal epitope tag were transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. The wild-type and the kinase-defective mutant Akt proteins were subsequently immunoprecipitated from serumstarved, transiently transfected cells before and after PDGF stimulation. PDGF activated only the wild-type Akt kinase. These results confirmed that the PDGF-induced protein kinase activity associated with the Akt immunoprecipitates was due to the activation of Akt.

The lower parts of both panels show Western blots of total cell lysates, probed with the anti-Erk antibody. AKT2 was also activated by PDGF, we transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells with HA epitope-tagged AKT2 expression constructs. AKT2 immunoprecipitated from the transfected cells with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was activated by PDGF (Figure 1 D). The expression of the transiently transfected HA-AKT2 construct was confirmed by probing a Western blot of the anti-HA immunoprecipitates with the anti-Akt-CT antibody (Figure 1D). In similar experiments, the closest homolog of Akt in humans, AKT1, and the Drosophila homolog Daktl were also activated by PDG F (data not shown). Moreover, the protein encoded by the viral oncogene v-akt was shown to exhibit basal kinase activity and enhanced responsiveness to PDGF stimulation (T. F. F. and P. N. T., unpublished data). Akt Kinase Activity Is Induced Rapidly and Specifically by PDGF To determine the specificity of the PDGF-induced activation of Akt, we carried out in vitro kinase assays using Akt immunoprecipitates from serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells before and after exposure to PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, PDGFAB, epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). The results (Figure 2A) revealed that the PDGF-induced activation of Akt is highly specific, in that it is induced by all three isoforms of PDGF but not by the other tested factors, The failure of EGF, FGF, and PMA to induce the activation of Akt could be due to the failure of the NIH 3T3 cells to respond to these factors. To test this possibility, we examined the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis migration of the MAP kinases p44 Erkl and p42 Erk2, in the same lysates used for the in vitro kinase assays in Figure 2A, by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-Erk antiserum. EGF, FGF, and PMA each induced MAPK size shifts diagnostic of MAPK activation (Figure 2A) (Marshall, 1995). Therefore, the failure of these factors to induce Akt activation was not due to their inability to stimulate the NIH 3T3 cells. Subsequently, we examined the kinetics of Akt activation following exposure of serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells to PDGF at room temperature and at 4°C. Figure 2B shows the time course of Akt activation at room temperature. Akt was activated within 1 rain, with maximum activity reached within 3 min of exposure to PDGF. A delay in Akt activation (3 min) was observed when the stimulation was carried out at 4°C (data not shown). Western blot analyses of the cell lysates in Figure 2B, using the anti-Erk antiserum, showed that the PDGF-induced MAPK size shift was delayed relative to the PDGF-induced activation of Akt. Despite the rapidity of activation of Akt, however, immunoprecipitations of the PDGF receptor (PDGFR) or of Akt from lysates of PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells failed to show a direct association between the two molecules (data not shown). The PDGF-Induced Activation of Akt Is AH/PH Domain Dependent Given that the AH/PH domain is a characteristic feature of all the Akt family members (Cheng et al., 1992; Franke et al., 1994) and that all the known members of this family are activated by PDGF (this paper), we examined whether the AH/PH domain may be mediating PDGF-induced Akt signals. Constructs of two mutants, one carrying an arginine to cysteine mutation at am ino acid 25 (HA-Akt R25C) and another carrying a deletion of amino acids 11-35 (HAAkt 411-35), were transiently transfected in NIH 3T3 cells. In vitro kinase assays of the two mutants immunoprecipitated from lysates of serum-starved or serum-starved and PDGF-stimulated cells revealed that both fail to respond I Histone H2B I Phosphorylation HA.Akt (wt and mutants) Expression PDGF ~ , <. <. <. < "r I "lr" I II ]1 II - 4- + - + - 4- Figure 3.

(C) Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at position 740 (F740) or 751 (F751) of the PDGFRI3 do not abolish Akt activation. In vitro kinase assays of Akt immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody from TRMP cells stably transfected with PDGFRI3 mutants, as indicated, and supertransfected transiently with HA-Akt.

In vitro kinase assays of Akt immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody from primary MEFs and SV40-transformed MEFs from Src knockout mice (Src6), transiently transfected with HA-Akt. Following overnight serum starvation, the cells were stimulated with PDGF-AB (50 ng/ml). to PDGF stimulation (Figure 3). The R25C mutation was tested because a comparable mutation (R28C) in the PH domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) had been shown to be responsible for the induction of X-linked immunodeficiency in CBA/N mice (Rawlings et al., 1993). To determine whether these AH/PH mutations affected the basal kinase activity of Akt, we overexpressed the wild-type and mutant proteins in COS1 cells, and following serum starvation, we examined their kinase activity. The results (data not shown) revealed that the mutant proteins continued to exhibit kinase activity. Therefore, the AH/PH mutations did not affect the ability of these proteins to function as protein kinases. The Activation of Akt by PDGF Requires Signals That Depend upon the PDGFRI~ Tyrosines 740 and 751 To define the signaling pathway responsible for the PDGFinduced activation of Akt, we cotransfected canine kidney epithelial TRMP cells, which do not express PDGFR (Valius and Kazlauskas, 1993), with wild-type or mutant PDGFR and HA epitope-tagged Akt constructs. Following PDGF stimulation, Akt was immunoprecipitated from the transfected cells by use of the monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody. In vitro kinase assays of the Akt immunoprecipitates, shown in Figure 4A, revealed that both the a and the 15 subunits of the human PDGFR (Heldin, 1995) transduce Akt activation signals. However, the kinase-defective PDGFRI3 mutant M635R and another mutant, whose two tyrosine phosphorylation sites Y740 and Y751 had been mutated into phenylalanines (F2), failed to transmit PDGF signals leading to Akt activation. The phosphorylation of the PDGFRI3 tyrosine Y751 generates a high affinity binding site for Nck (Heldin, 1995), while the phosphorylation of tyrosines Y740 and Y751 generates a high affinity binding site for the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI 3-kinase  Akt Activation by PDGF via PI 3-Kinase 731 (Heldin, 1995). These data suggested, therefore, that the transduction of PDGF-induced Akt activation signals depends on the interaction of the activated PDGFR with PI 3-kinase, Nck, or both. To confirm and extend these results, we repeated the experiment in Figure 4A but used the wild-type PDGFRI3; a PDGFRI3 mutant whose tyrosine phosphorylation sites Y740, Y751, Y771, Y1009, and Y1021 had been mutated into phenylalanines (F5 mutant) (Valius and Kazlauskas, 1993); and three F5 phenylalanine to tyrosine add-back revertants (YY740/51, Y751, and Y771). The tyrosine phosphorylation sites Y771, Y1009, and Y1021 direct the binding of rasGAP, Syp, and phospholipase C (PLC)-y1 to PDGFRI~, respectively (Heldin, 1995). The results (Figure 4B) revealed that full activation of Akt required tyrosine residues at both the 740 and 751 positions. The phenylalanine to tyrosine mutation at position 751 could partially reconstitute the ability of the receptor to activate Akt following PDGF stimulation. Finally, the Y771 revertant was identical to the F5 mutant with regard to its inability to activate Akt. Both the HA-Akt and the PDGFR constructs were expressed in the transfected cells. Moreover, both the e and 13 subunits of the PDGFR as well as all the mutants of the PDGFRI3, with the exception of M635R, responded to PDGF stimulation with tyrosine autophosphorylation (Figures 4A and 4B). Therefore, the failure of some of the mutant receptors to activate Akt was not due to lack of expression or to lack of PDGF receptor activity. The results of the experiment in Figure 4B were confirmed by additional experiments utilizing TRMP cells stably transfected with expression constructs of PDGFRI3 m utants in which the tyrosines Y740, Y751, or Y1009 and Y1021 had been changed into phenylalanines. The end point in these experiments was the activation of the Akt protein kinase encoded by a transiently transfected HAAkt expression construct. The results (Figure 4C) showed that PDGFRI~ constructs with tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at position 740 or 751 encoded proteins that were able to transmit PDGF-induced Akt activation signals. TRMP cells stably transfected with PDGFRI3 constructs, carrying tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at positions Y1009 and Y1021, were also shown to respond to PDG F with full activation of the Akt kinase. These results confirmed the results of the preceding experiments. Moreover, they suggested that the phosphotyrosine phosphatase Syp and PLC-~,I, which bind to tyrosines Y1009 and Y1021, respectively (Heldin, 1995), are not involved in the activation of Akt. Finally, given that the mutant F751 retains the ability to transduce Akt activation signals, these data suggested that it is unlikely for Nck, which binds to phosphorylated Y751 (Heldin, 1995), to contribute to this process. In addition to the PDGFRI3 tyrosines mutated in the F5 mutant, other tyrosines involved in PDGF signaling are the tyrosines at positions 579 and 581. These tyrosines define the high affinity binding site for Src (Heldin, 1995). To determine whether Src is involved in the PDGF-induced activation of Akt, we could not use phenylalanine to tyrosine receptor mutants at this site, because these mutants lack tyrosine kinase activity (Heldin, 1995). To address this question, we used a large T antigen-immortalized mouse embryo fibroblast cell line derived from Src knockout mice (Soriano et al., 1991). PDGF stimulation induced full activation of the Akt kinase (Figure 4D). Although it may be possible that other Src-like kinases can substitute for Src in these cells (Heldin, 1995), these data suggest that it is unlikely for Src to play an important role in Akt activation. The data shown in Figure 4 therefore collectively suggest that the major factor responsible for the PDGF-induced activation of Akt is the activation of the PI 3-kinase. PDGF-Induced Akt Activation Is Inhibited by Wortmannin The preceding results suggested that Akt activation is PI 3-kinase dependent, However, it is possible that Akt activation signals might be transduced by other proteins interacting with tyrosines Y740 or Y751 of the PDGFR~, To address the role of the PI 3-kinase further, we examined the effects of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin on the PDGF-induced Akt activation, Wortmannin at nanomolar concentrations is known to inhibit only the PI 3-kinase, whereas at micromolar concentrations, it also inhibits proA  Wortmannin (riM) Rapamycin (ng/ml) (* in vitro) Histone H2B Phosphorylation Akt Expression p70 S6k p44Erkl/p42 Erk2 - - 100" 0.5 2.5 5 I0 20 50 100 500 - ........... 20 PDGF + + + + + + + + + + + B Wortmannin (nM) 100" 100 Rapamycin (ng/rnl) - 20 (* in vitro) PI-3-P -~ ori PDGF + + + + Figure 5.

The Activation of Akt Is Inhibited by Dominant Inhibitory N17Ras, but Akt Fails to Activate the MAPK (A) Dominant inhibitory N17Ras inhibits Akt activation.

(C) Akt does not induce MAPK activity, COS1 cells were transfected with Myc epitope-tagged MAPK (MT-p44) and v-akt or the indicated HA epitope-tagged Akt constructs. Akt and MAP kinase activities were examined in serum-starved or serum-starved and EGF-stimulated cells (100 ng/ml for 10 min). tein kinases (Powis et al., 1994). NIH 3T3 cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of wortmannin (0.5-500 nM) prior to PDGF stimulation. Alternatively, wortmannin was added in vitro to lysates of PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells (100 nM). Wortmannin inhibited Akt activation in vivo at concentrations similar to the ones inhibiting the PI 3-kinase (Powis et al., 1994). However, wortmannin failed to inhibit Akt in vitro (Figure 5A), suggesting that, at the concentrations used, it has no direct inhibitory effects on the activity of Akt. The tyrosine kinase receptor-mediated activation of the PI 3-kinase leads to the activation of the p70 s6k by a process that is inhibited not only by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin but also by the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin (Downward, 1994). Rapamycin inactivates the PI 3-kinaserelated protein RAFT1 (for rapamycin and FKBP12 target 1) by promoting its binding to FKBP12 (Sabatini et al., 1994). To determine whether Akt functions upstream or downstream of RAFT1 in the pathway leading to the activation of the p70 s6k, we examined the effects of rapamycin on the PDGF-induced activation of Akt. The results showed that rapamycin does not inhibit Akt (Figure 5A). Therefore, the activation of Akt is independent of RAFT1. Subsequently, we examined the effects of wortmannin and rapamycin on the activity of the PI 3-kinase in the serum-starved or serum-starved and PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells utilized in the preceding experiment. PI 3-kinase assays carried out as described in the Experimental Procedures showed that wortmannin concentrations inhibiting the PDGF-induced activation of Akt also blocked the activity of the PI 3-kinase, whereas rapamycin had no effect on the activity of either (Figure 5B). Therefore, the activation of the PI 3-kinase and Akt by PDGF appear to be functionally linked. PDGF-Induced Activation of Akt Is Inhibited by N17Ras GTP-bound c-Ha-Ras interacts with the catalytic subunit of the PI 3-kinase and contributes to its activation (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1994). In accordance with this, the dominant negative mutant of c-Ha-Ras, N17Ras, blocks the receptor-mediated activation of the PI 3-kinase (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1994). To test whether Akt is a downstream target of the PI 3-kinase, we also examined whether its activation by PDGF was inhibited by the dominant negative mutant of c-Ha-Ras, N17Ras. To this end, we examined the kinase activity of HA epitope-tagged Akt before and after PDGF stimulation following cotransfection of N17Ras and HA-Akt. N17Ras partially blocks the PDGF-induced activation of Akt (Figure 6A). To determine whether c-Ha-Ras was sufficient to induce Akt activation, we examined the kinase activity of the endogenous Akt protein, before and after PDGF stimulation, in NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with a construct of the activated form of c-Ha-Ras, V12Ras. V12Ras was not sufficient to activate Akt in the absence of PDGF (Figure 6B). This result may be due to the activation of the PI 3-kinase by V12Ras at levels below the threshold necessary for Akt activation (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1994). Alternatively, it may be due to the fact that the activation of Akt by PDGF may be mediated by both Ras-dependent and Rasindependent signals. The Ras-dependent activation of Akt shown in Figure 6A suggested that Akt may be a member of a signaling pathway that activates the MAP kinase (Marshall, 1995). To address this question, we tested the ability of overexpressed, enzymatically active v-akt and HA-Akt to activate MAPK in COS1 cells. EGF stimulation was used as a positive control, and the kinase-defective mutant of Akt (HA-  Akt Activation by PDGF via PI 3-Kinase 733 A Histone H2B Phosphorylation cC + + + + ~F---IF~II II B 0-= o_~" '~-~5 o~.¢ + +v +..4 + I II ]1 II I Histone H2B Phosphorylation 'o b v Q. £L OC O- Q.

In Vitro Activation of Akt Activity by PIP (A) Akt immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from serum-starved or serum-starved and PDGF-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells is activated by PIP (PI-3-P) but not PI or PIP2 (PI-4,5-P2). (B) Activation of Akt by PIP generated by PI 3-kinase immunoprecipirated either with anti-PI 3-kinase or with anti-PY. (C) Akt activity is induced by PIP in a dose-dependent manner. Increasing concentrations of enzymatically produced PIP were added to Akt from serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells. PIP was diluted in PI carrier. Akt activity in the presence of PIP plus PI carrier relative to its activity in the presence of PI only was as follows: PI plus 10 -2 PIP, 2.51 x; PI plus 10 -1 PIP, 4.54x; PIP, 4.49x. Akt K179M) was used as a negative control. Even though v-akt and HA-Akt were active as determined by the ability of the immunoprecipitated proteins to phosphorylate histone H2B, they both failed to activate MAPK (Figure 6C). Oncogenic v-raf and V12Ras induced MAP kinase activity in parallel experiments (data not shown). Furthermore, MAPK was not activated in NIH 3T3 cells expressing v-akt (data not shown). Akt Is Activated by PIP In Vitro The data presented in this manuscript indicate that the PDGF-induced activation of Akt depends upon the integrity of its AH/PH domain, and upon the activation of the PI 3-kinase. Moreover, recent studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2, also referred to as PI-4,5-P2) binds to the PH domain of pleckstrin (Cohen et al., 1995). This observation, combined with our genetic and pharmacological data, suggested that Akt may be activated through the interaction between its AH/ PH domain and PI 3-kinase-generated D-3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides. To test this hypothesis, we carried out in vitro kinase assays of Akt immunoprecipitated from serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells, in the presence of phosphatidylinositol (PI), PIP2, and enzymatically synthesized phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PIP, also referred to as Table 1.

PIP generated enzymatically, using PI as the substrate, was used either directly or after dilution in carrier PI as indicated. Mean and standard deviation values were calculated on the basis of five experiments, with the exception of the 104 and 10 -4 values, which were calculated on the basis of the results of three experiments. In all experiments PI was given a value of 1. Quantitation of experiments was performed with a Phosphorimager. PI-3-P) (Experimental Procedures). While PI or PIP2 appeared to suppress Akt activity, PIP activated the Akt kinase in vitro (Figure 7A; Table 1). To confirm that the enzyme immunoprecipitated from PDGF-stimulated cells was the PI 3-kinase, the experiment in Figure 7A was repeated using anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-PY) or anti-p85 immunoprecipitates. The proteins immunoprecipitated with both antibodies phosphorylated PI (data not shown), and the products of both reactions induced Akt activation (Figure 7B). Serial dilutions of enzymatically produced PIP (using PI as a carrier) induced the activation of Akt in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 7C; Table 1). Owing to the suppression of Akt activity by PI, however, the induction of Akt activation by PIP appeared to be partially masked. Perhaps because of this and variations in the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of PI to PIP between experiments, the ability of different preparations of PIP to activate Akt in vitro varied (Table 1). Discussion In this paper, we have shown that the product of the c-akt proto-oncogene is specifically activated by PDGF. To determine the mechanism for PDGF-induced Akt activation, we expressed the wild-type PDGFR and a series of PDGFRp tyrosine mutants in PDGFR-negative TRMP cells. Akt activity was examined in these cells before and after PDGF stimulation. The results showed that tyrosines Y740 and Y751, which upon autophosphorylation form a high affinity binding site for the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI 3-kinase (Heldin, 1995), are required for PDGFinduced Akt activation. These results suggested that Akt may be a downstream target of the PDGF-activated PI 3-kinase. Additional studies supporting this hypothesis showed that the activation of Akt by PDGF is abrogated by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Powis et al., 1994) and by the dominant negative mutant of c-Ha-Ras, N 17Ras. However, the activation of Akt was not abrogated by rapamycin (Figure 8), a macrolide antibiotic that inacti-  Cell 734 PDGF l "~"~lb P'~3"P ----~ Akt I MAP Wortmannin ~ kinase cascade Rapamycin ~ RAFT1 p70 ssk Figure 8. A Model for Akt Activation by PDGF PDGF- and Ras-dependent activation of the PI 3-kinase induces PIP (PI=3-P), which activates Akt perhaps via binding to the Akt PH domain (see Discussion for details), vates the PI 3-kinase homolog RAFT1 by promoting its interaction with FKBP12 (Sabatini et al., 1994). Mutational analysis of Akt revealed that the AH/PH domain is required for its PI 3-kinase-dependent activation. These results, combined, suggested that the PDGF-mediated activation of Akt may be due to conformational changes induced by the interaction of Akt with phosphoinositides phosphorylated in the D-3 position by the PDGF-activated PI 3-kinase. The ability of D-3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides to activate Akt was confirmed by in vitro kinase assays that examined the activity of Akt immunoprecipitated from serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells in the presence or absence of exogenously added phosphoinositides. The activation of Akt and perhaps other members of the Akt family of kinases via their interaction with this class of phospholipids is particularly interesting in light of the relationship of the Akt and PKC kinase families (Bellacosa et al., 1991). These findings, therefore, reinforce the concept that the two families are ancestrally related and that they may have been evolutionarily separated to optimize their response to different second messenger lipids. The N-terminal 147 amino acids of Akt define a domain that is conserved among Akt molecules (the AH domain) (Franke et al., 1994) and whose 106 N-terminal amino acids exhibit homology with the PH domain (Cohen et al., 1995). Recently, the solution structure of the PH domains of pleckstrin and I~-spectrin and the crystal structure of the PH domain of dynamin were determined (Cohen et al., 1995). All three structures revealed that the N-terminal portion of the PH domain forms a hydrophobic pocket consisting of seven antiparallel I~ sheets, whereas its C-terminal portion forms an amphipathic ~ helix that may cap the pocket. This structure suggested that PH domains may interact with lipids and perhaps other hydrophobic ligands. Support for this hypothesis was provided by experiments showing that PIP2 binds the PH domain of pleckstrin (Cohen et al., 1995) and by earlier studies suggesting that the PH domain of PLC-$1 may be involved in the binding of the enzyme to lipid bilayers containing PIP2 (Cifuentes et al., 1994). Viewed in the context of these observations, our data suggest that the PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of Akt may be due to the direct interaction of PIP with the hydrophobic pocket of the Akt AH/PH domain. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that minor phospholipid products of the P I 3-kinase or of other enzymes coimm unoprecipitated with the PI 3-kinase contribute to the activation of Akt in our assay system. To confirm these results, it will therefore be necessary to use purified or synthetic phospholipids as they become available (Divecha and Irvine, 1995). Our earlier studies had shown that Akt forms multimeric complexes through the interaction between AH domains and that the formation of such complexes may be associated with the activation of the Akt kinase (Datta et al., 1995). The PH domain alone fails to form complexes, suggesting that the interaction between Akt molecules depends on the integrity of the entire AH domain. Additional studies from other laboratories support the concept that PH domains are involved in protein-protein interactions (Touhara et al., 1994; Yao et al., 1994). These findings, combined with the results presented in this manuscript, suggest that PH domains may exert a dual function. Thus, Akt may interact with other proteins via its AH/PH domain, bringing it in close proximity to D-3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides and other hydrophobic molecules. The specificity of Akt activation by PDGF was somewhat unexpected in view of the findings suggesting that Akt is activated as a result of the interaction of D-3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides with the AH/PH domain. Indeed, D-3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides are induced not only by PDGF but also by growth factors (Kapeller and Cantley, 1994) th at do not activate Akt. This could be owing to the relatively higher levels of D-3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides generated by PDGF than by other growth factors, or to differences in the composition or subcellular distribution of phosphoinositides observed in cells treated with different factors (Kapeller and Cantley, 1994). Alternatively, different growth factors may activate PI 3-kinase enzymes that may vary with regard to their enzymatic properties, regulation, and subcellular distribution (Kapeller and Cantley, 1994). In addition, Akt activation may require the contribution of multiple signaling pathways. Thus, whereas the dominant inhibitory N17Ras inhibits Akt activation by PDGF, the activated V12Ras is not sufficient to stimulate Akt. While we cannot exclude the possibility that Vl 2Ras fails to stimulate Akt because it is a weak activator of the PI 3-kinase (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1994), these results suggest that other signals initiated by PDGF may act in concert with Ras to induce Akt activity. The specificity of Akt activation by PDGF suggests that Akt may transduce signals that distinguish PDGF from other growth factors. Therefore, the characterization of the signals transduced by activated Akt may provide significant insight into the specificity of the cellular response to growth factors. Our data to date indicate that Akt fails to activate the MAP kinase cascade despite the fact that its activation depends, at least in part, on Ras-rnediated signals. This suggests, therefore, that Akt functions in a Rasdependent pathway that is independent of the MAP kinases. One such pathway involving MEKK and the JNK kinases was indeed recently described (Marshall, 1995). The data presented in this report also show that PDGF  Akt Activation by PDGF via PI 3-Kinase 735 activates not only the rodent Akt but also the human AKT2. In addition, data not shown indicate that PDGF activates all the known members of the Akt family of kinases, including the human AKT1 and the Drosophila Daktl. AKT2 has been previously shown to be amplified and overexpressed in about 10% of ovarian neoplasms (Cheng et al., 1992). Moreover, it has been shown that the expression of PDGFR(~ is frequently elevated in ovarian tumors and that enhanced expression of PDGFR(z is associated with poor prognosis (Henriksen et al., 1993). Our data therefore indicate the need for future studies to address the combined effects of Akt and PDGFR overexpression on the induction, progression, and prognosis of human ovarian tumors. Overall, the studies presented in this report show that the PH domain is required for the enzymatic activation of Akt in response to signals originating in the PDGFR. Moreover, they show that Akt activation may be mediated by second messenger molecules generated via the PDGFinduced activation of the PI 3-kinase. These findings define a specific signal that activates Akt, identify a target for the PI 3-kinase, and implicate the Akt AH/PH domain as a mediator of PI 3-kinase signaling.    The serine–threonine kinase AKT regulates proliferation and survival by phosphorylating a network of protein substrates. In this study, we describe a kinase-independent function of AKT. In cancer cells harboring gain-of-function alterations in MET, HER2, or Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K), catalytically inactive AKT (K179M) protected from drug induced cell death in a PH-domain dependent manner. An AKT kinase domain mutant found in human melanoma (G161V) lacked enzymatic activity in vitro and in AKT1/AKT2 double knockout cells, but promoted growth factor independent survival of primary human melanocytes. ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors failed to block the kinase-independent function of AKT, a liability that limits their effectiveness compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors. Our results broaden the current view of AKT function and have important implications for the development of AKT inhibitors for cancer.

If any cells manage to escape these restrictions, they may rapidly divide and form tumors, which can lead to cancer.  A protein called AKT can encourage cells to survive and divide, and in healthy cells it is only allowed to be active at specific times. However, in many cancer cells, the genes that make and control AKT activity can be altered by mutations, which can result in AKT being active at the wrong times.  Part of the AKT protein acts as an enzyme called a kinase and adds chemical groups called phosphates to other proteins. The phosphate groups can activate or deactivate these proteins to control cell survival and cell division. However, there are other sections to the AKT protein and it is not clear how they are involved in this protein's activity.  In this study, Vivanco et al. show that AKT has another role in cell survival that does not depend on its kinase. The experiments show that even when the kinase part of the protein is missing, AKT can help cancer cells to survive drug treatments and external conditions that would normally kill them. This role requires another section of the protein called the PH-domain.  There are several chemicals—called inhibitors—that can stop AKT from working properly, and they have the potential to be used to treat some types of cancer. These inhibitors work in different ways: some were able to block the activity of the kinase, but others inhibited AKT by binding to other parts of the protein. Therefore, to develop AKT inhibitors into effective drugs, it will be important to know precisely what role the protein plays in different types of cancers.  DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03751.002  Go to: Introduction The serine–threonine kinase AKT is a non-receptor kinase that plays critical roles in growth and metabolism (Pearce et al., 2010). AKT is aberrantly activated in many human cancers, usually due to mutations in upstream components of the Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway. AKT signaling is required for tumor maintenance in certain genetic contexts, as has been shown for some cancer cell lines harboring PI3K mutations or amplification of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase (She et al., 2008). Encouraged by these results, several ATP-competitive and allosteric AKT inhibitors have been identified (Engelman, 2009), but optimal strategies for the clinical development of these agents are currently unknown.  Go to: Results To address this question, we compared the activity of the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206 (Hirai et al., 2010) with the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors GSK690693 (Heerding et al., 2008; Rhodes et al., 2008) and GDC0068 (Lin et al., 2013). Each of these AKT inhibitors dose dependently inhibited AKT kinase activity in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line EBC1 as determined by phosphorylation of three AKT substrates (PRAS40, GSK3β, and BAD) in whole-cell lysates (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Consistent with previous reports (Okuzumi et al., 2009), the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors induced hyper-phosphorylation of AKT at the two regulatory phosphorylation sites threonine 308 and serine 473. When we compared the ability of the AKT inhibitors to induce cell death using a trypan blue exclusion assay, we observed significantly greater cell death induction by the allosteric inhibitor MK2206 compared to the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors GSK690693 (Figure 1B—source data 1) and GDC0068 (Figure 1C—source data 1) despite less complete inhibition of AKT substrate phosphorylation at these drug concentrations (Figure 1A).  Figure 1. Figure 1. Differential sensitivity of human cancer cells to different classes of AKT inhibitors. We had selected EBC1 lung cancer cells for our initial studies because they harbor amplification of MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates critical oncogenic signals through the PI3K/AKT axis (Gherardi et al., 2012). To test whether other MET-amplified human cancer cells show a similar drug response pattern, we extended our experiments to MET-amplified H1993 and H1648 NSCLC cell lines and GTL-16 gastric cancer cells. MK2206 again induced significantly more cell death than GSK690693 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 1—source data 1). In cell lines with other PI3K pathway alterations previously associated with ‘AKT-dependence’ (She et al., 2008), we also found that MK2006 induced significantly more cell death than ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors. These cell lines included breast cancer cells with HER2 amplification and/or PIK3CA-mutation (Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 3, Figure 1—source data 1). In contrast, MK2206 did not induce cell death in non-transformed bronchial epithelial cells (data not shown). MK2206 also did not induce cell death in lung cancer cell lines with activating EGFR mutations (Figure 1—figure supplement 4, Figure 1—source data 1) which have been linked with aberrant PI3K pathway activation (Engelman et al., 2005), suggesting that the mode of PI3K activation is critical in establishing AKT addiction in cancer.  To exclude the possibility that the greater cell death induction by the allosteric AKT inhibitor was due to additional effects on proteins other than AKT, we stably expressed a synthetic AKT mutant in which a residue critical for allosteric inhibitor binding (tryptophan 80) (Green et al., 2008; Calleja et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010) had been replaced by an alanine. Expression of AKT1 W80A or AKT2 W80A but not wild-type AKT1 or wild-type AKT2 completely rescued MK2206-induced cell death (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 5, Figure 1—source data 1). Western blot analysis confirmed that these AKT alleles are biochemically insensitive to MK2206 and prevented the induction of PARP cleavage, a marker of apoptosis (Figure 1—figure supplement 6, Figure 1—source data 1).  Of note, all three inhibitors were able to induce near-complete proliferation arrest (Figure 1—figure supplement 7, Figure 1—source data 1). These results demonstrate that allosteric and ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors differ in their ability to block AKT-mediated survival, and that this survival signal can be mediated by AKT1 or AKT2.  AKT regulates survival through phosphorylation of several protein substrates. We were therefore surprised that ATP-competitive inhibitors induced less cell death than MK2206 despite greater or equal inhibition of AKT substrate phosphorylation (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 8). We could not explain these results by differential effects on induction of ErbB3 expression or IGF-IRβ phosphorylation (Figure 1—figure supplement 9) which can accompany AKT inhibition and mediate resistance to AKT inhibitors (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011).  One potential explanation for our observations is that ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors might induce an AKT conformation which can serve as a platform for a kinase-independent survival signal (Figure 2A). If true, ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors might antagonize cell death induction by a variety of cell death stimuli, for example, inhibition of the MET kinase in MET-amplified EBC1 cells. We found this to be the case. Despite inducing a modest amount of cell death as single agent, GSK690693 antagonized the ability of crizotinib to kill EBC1 cells. The allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206, in contrast, did not compromise the ability of crizotinib to induce cell death (Figure 2B, Figure 2—source data 1).  Figure 2. Figure 2. Catalytically inactive AKT supports the survival of AKT-dependent human cancer cells. To provide genetic evidence for the kinase-independent AKT function, we took advantage of a synthetic AKT mutant which is catalytically inactive due to substitution of lysine by methionine at position 179 at the ATP-binding site (AKT K179M) (Franke et al., 1995). When we expressed this mutant in MCF7 breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-361 breast cancer cells and EBC1 lung cancer cells, catalytically inactive AKT (Figure 2C/D/E, Figure 2—source data 1) but not wild-type AKT (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—source data 1), protected from MK2206-induced cell death. Compared to the complete cell death protection provided by the drug-resistant W80A-AKT allele (Figure 1E, Figure 1—source data 1), the protection by the K179M-AKT allele was only partial, consistent with the coexistence of kinase-independent and kinase-dependent AKT signals.  We also used an AKT knockdown strategy to minimize the effect of AKT overexpression on the stoichiometry of the AKT signaling complex. For this purpose, we first generated EBC1 cells with doxycycline-inducible human-specific shRNAs for both AKT 1 and AKT 2 and then expressed a kinase-deficient (AKT1-K179M) AKT1 cDNA of murine origin that is partially resistant to knockdown due to mismatches in the mouse sequence. Protein levels of the hairpin-resistant AKT allele after doxycycline induction were similar to the levels of endogenous AKT in parental EBC1 cells (Figure 2F, top, lanes 6 and 8 vs lanes 1 and 3). Similar to our results with pharmacological AKT blockade, catalytically inactive AKT protected from cell death following doxycycline treatment and AKT depletion of these cells (Figure 2F, bottom, Figure 2—source data 1).  We next examined the effects of AKT inhibitors on phosphoinositide (PI) binding. In the absence of growth factors, AKT is inactive because intermolecular interactions between the pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase domain (KD) keep the kinase in a closed conformation (Calleja et al., 2009). Following growth factor stimulation, AKT shifts to an open conformation and becomes accessible to phosphorylation on threonine 308 and serine 473, a process that requires localization of AKT to the plasma membrane through the interaction with the phospholipid products of PI3K, phosphatidyl-inositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns (3,4,5)P3], and PtdIns(3,4)P2. Using a PI pull-down assay, we observed that MK2206 markedly impaired phosphoinositide binding (Figure 3A). This result is consistent with findings from structural studies that allosteric AKT inhibitors lock AKT in a closed conformation with its phospholipid binding site blocked by the kinase domain (Wu et al., 2010). In contrast to our findings with MK2206, incubation with the ATP-competitive inhibitor GSK690693 increased binding of AKT to PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 and this was associated with increased localization of AKT to the plasma membrane (Figure 3B).  Figure 3. Figure 3. Kinase-dead AKT protects from drug-induced cell death in a PH-domain-dependent manner. We next explored the structural requirements for the pro-survival signal of catalytically inactive AKT. Similar to GSK690693-bound AKT, the AKT1-K179M (or AKT2-K181M) mutant was hyper-phosphorylated at T308 (Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This phosphorylation event occurs at the plasma membrane (Stephens et al., 1998) and immunofluorescence in MCF10A and EBC1 cells confirmed that kinase-dead AKT was constitutively localized to the plasma membrane (Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 2).  To examine whether membrane localization was sufficient for the pro-survival function of AKT1-K179M, we replaced the PH-domain of AKT1-K179M by a membrane-targeting myristoylation signal and expressed this mutant in EBC1 cells. This mutant was unable to inhibit MK2206-induced cell death (Figure 3E, Figure 3—source data 1) despite being constitutively phosphorylated in the presence of MK2206 (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Lastly, we abolished the ability of the AKT1-K179M mutant to bind phospholipids by introducing a second substitution at an amino acid residue (R86) critical for binding of AKT to PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 (Thomas et al., 2002). Consistent with a loss of membrane localization, the R86A/K179M double mutant showed loss of AKT phosphorylation at threonine 308 when expressed in HCT116 cells that express no endogenous AKT (Ericson et al., 2010) (Figure 3—figure supplement 4A) and it did not protect from MK2206-induced dephosphorylation in cells which do express endogenous AKT (Figure 3—figure supplement 4B). Abrogation of phosphoinositide binding by the R86A substitution did not impair the pro-survival function of kinase-defective AKT (Figure 3F, Figure 3—source data 1). We observed a similar result with a second mutation (R25C) known to abolish phosphoinositide binding (Thomas et al., 2002) (Figure 3—figure supplement 4C, Figure 3—source data 1).  Mutations in the coding sequence of AKT are rare in human cancers but provide important insights into AKT regulation (Parikh et al., 2012). We wondered whether there was precedence in human cancer for kinase-dead AKT mutations. Our survey of published cancer sequencing data identified five AKT2 kinase domain mutations that occurred in at least two independent samples (G161V/E, R170W, I289M, H355Y, R368C/H) (Figure 4A). We engineered each of these mutations into an AKT2 expression vector and stably expressed the mutant protein in HCT116 cells with targeted deletions of AKT1 and AKT2 (HCT116-DKO). AKT2-G161V, but none of the other four kinase domain mutants, showed complete loss of in vitro AKT substrate phosphorylation, comparable to the synthetic kinase-dead K181M-AKT2 mutant included as control in our experiments (Figure 4B). Whole-cell lysates from G161V-AKT2 expressing cells showed loss of phosphorylation for the endogenous AKT kinase substrates PRAS40 and BAD (Figure 4C). In the phosphoinositide pull-down assay, AKT2-G161V showed altered phosphoinositide binding with acquired preference for PtdIns(4,5)P2, again similar to the synthetic kinase-dead AKT2 mutant (Figure 4D).  Figure 4. Figure 4. AKT mutants found in human cancer can promote cell survival independently of kinase activity. Since AKT2-G161V was found in a human melanoma sample, we explored the pro-survival potential of this mutant in immortalized human melanocytes. These cells required 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for survival in culture, as has previously been reported (Arita et al., 1992), but acquired the ability to survive in TPA-deficient media (RPMI) after stable expression of AKT2-G161V (Figure 4E, Figure 4—source data 1).  The increased PI(4,5)P2 binding of the kinase-dead G161V-AKT2 mutant (Figure 4D) was reminiscent of the most common somatic AKT mutation in human cancer (E17K-AKT1) which localizes to the plasma membrane due to increased affinity for the constitutive plasma membrane lipid PI(4,5)P2 (Carpten et al., 2007; Landgraf et al., 2008). This raised the question whether kinase activity might be dispensable for the pro-survival functions of the oncogenic E17K-AKT1 mutant. To explore this question, we compared the effects of E17K-AKT1 and a kinase-defective allele of this mutant (E17K/K179M-AKT1) in EBC1 cells. Compared to cells transduced with wild-type AKT, cells transduced with the E17K-AKT1 mutant showed residual AKT phosphorylation at equimolar concentrations of MK2206 (Figure 4F), consistent with the reported reduced sensitivity of E17K-AKT1 to allosteric ATP kinase inhibitors (Calleja et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Parikh et al., 2012). Expression of E17K-AKT1 provided partial protection from MK2206-induced cell death (Figure 4G, Figure 4—source data 1). Interestingly, the E17K/K179M-AKT1 double mutant provided a similar degree of protection as the E17K-AKT1 single mutant, suggesting that this cancer-associated PH-domain mutant can mediate survival signals independent of its catalytic activity in certain cellular contexts.  Lastly, we identified a human endometrial cancer cell line with a kinase domain mutation in AKT1 (G311D) (Barretina et al., 2012) that failed to induce phosphorylation of endogenous AKT substrates in AKT1/2 DKO HCT116 cells (Figure 5A). While knockdown of endogenous AKT1 or AKT2 resulted in growth inhibition, knockdown of AKT1 resulted in substantially greater cell death induction than knockdown of AKT2 (Figure 5B, Figure 5—source data 1), suggesting a state of addiction to signals provided by the mutant AKT1.  Figure 5. Figure 5. Endometrial cancer cells expressing endogenous kinase-deficient AKT1 are sensitive to AKT1 but not AKT2 knockdown. Go to: Discussion The work presented here represents the first example of a kinase-independent function of AKT (Figure 4H). Our findings that catalytically inactivating kinase domain mutations (AKT1-K179M, AKT2-K181M, AKT2-G161V) or ATP-competitive inhibitor binding to wild-type AKT can promote phosphoinositide binding document the critical importance of the kinase domain conformation on AKT PH-domain functions. It also suggests that hyper-phosphorylation of AKT in response to ATP-competitive inhibitors (Okuzumi et al., 2009) may not only be due to impaired phosphatase access (Chan et al., 2011) but also due to increased phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, given that the loss of phosphoinositide binding does not completely abolish the pro-survival function of kinase-deficient AKT, we suspect that the PH-domain promotes cell survival through regulation of interacting protein partners, and that perturbations in the kinase domain can influence PH-domain function by altering the ability of AKT to reach the appropriate sub-cellular compartment (likely those richest in PI(4,5)P2) and/or interact with specific effector proteins. Further studies are required to identify the effectors of catalytically inactive AKT and define its contribution to other AKT-regulated cellular processes.  Our findings have implications for the development of drugs to block AKT in cancer. Previous studies have shown that cancer-associated AKT mutations that favor an open conformation show reduced sensitivity to allosteric AKT inhibitors but retain sensitivity to ATP-competitive inhibitors (Calleja et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Parikh et al., 2012). Here, we show that cancer cells with aberrant AKT activation by common PI3K pathway lesions (HER2, PIK3CA, MET) show the opposite drug sensitivity profile with reduced sensitivity to ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors. The inability of ATP-competitive inhibitors to suppress non-catalytic AKT functions in certain genetic contexts may represent a liability compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors.

Go to: Methods Western blots  Cells were harvested directly on tissue culture plates with 1% triton cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, and normalized to equal amounts of total protein using the DC protein assay (Biorad).  Retroviral infections  For transduction of wild-type and mutant AKT alleles into EBC1, HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/−, MCF7, and MDA-MB-361 cells, amphotropic retroviruses were generated by co-transfection of retroviral constructs carrying the appropriate cDNA and the packaging plasmid pCL-Ampho (IMGENEX, San Diego, CA) into 293T cells. Viral particles were collected after 36 and 60 hr following transfection and target cells were infected for 18 hr with the respective virus. Stable expressors were derived through antibiotic selection. To immortalize human epidermal melanocytes (iHEM), primary melanocytes (ScienCell) were retrovirally infected with amphotropic pbabe-hTERT + p53DD virus using the above transduction protocol. For lentiviral transduction of Tet-inducible shRNAs targeting AKT1 and AKT2, viral particles were produced by co-transfection of shRNA constructs (listed above) with two packaging plasmids (pMD2G and pPAX2) into 293T cells. Five different viruses were generated (2 AKT1 hairpins and 3 AKT2 hairpins). Viral particles were collected at 36 and 60 hr after transfection. All five viruses were mixed, and infection of EBC1 cells was carried out for 8 hr after each virus collection. 36 hours after the last infection, cells were selected with 10 µM puromycin to derive stable expressors. Following selection, cells were also transduced with pLNCX-HA-mAKT1-K179M retrovirus and selected with 1 mg/ml G148 to generate cells with a hairpin-resistant AKT1-K179M allele.  Cell death assay  Cells were seeded on 6 cm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then treated with the indicated drugs at the indicated doses. Each treatment group was seeded in triplicate. Following treatment, both attached and unattached cells were harvested and counted on a ViCell Cell Viability analyzer. The instrument uses trypan blue to assess cell death. Cell death was expressed as the fraction of trypan blue-positive cells over the total number of cells. Statistical significance was assessed by one-tailed unequal variance t-test (ns = p > 0.05; * = p ≤ 0.05; ** = p ≤ 0.01, *** = p ≤ 0.001).  AKT kinase assay  AKT kinase assays were carried out using the non-radioactive AKT Kinase Assay Kit from Cell Signaling Technologies (Catalog #9840) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modification: HA-Tag antibody Sepharose bead conjugate was used to isolate AKT kinase. Briefly, HCT116 AKT1/2 DKO cells expressing exogenous HA-tagged AKT alleles were lysed in 1× lysis buffer and sonicated. Sonicated lysates were normalized to equal amounts of total protein. AKT was then purified from normalized lysates by HA immunoprecipitation for 3 hr at 4°C. HA beads were then washed two times with 500 µl lysis buffer and once with 1× kinase buffer. Beads were then resuspended in 50 µl kinase buffer, and kinase reaction was carried out for 30 min after addition of 1 µg of substrate and ATP to a final concentration of 200 µM. Reaction was terminated by adding 3× Laemmli buffer. 10 µl of kinase reaction were analyzed by immunoblot. Substrate phosphorylation and AKT content in each reaction was measured by immunoblot.  PIP binding assay  HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/− (with or without exogenous AKT) cells were grown on a monolayer, washed once with cold PBS, and harvested on the dish using lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, and EDTA-free protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Lysates were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. Cleared lysates were then normalized to equal amounts of total protein. The amount of AKT in each lysate was then quantified by Western blot using an HA antibody and the lysates normalized for AKT content using image analysis of AKT immunoreactive bands. Lysate from parental HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/− cells was used to normalize a second time for total protein amount. Each lysate was then divided into 10 aliquots to verify the final normalization by Western blot and for PIP binding analysis. PIP beads were obtained from Echelon Biosciences Inc. (Echelon Inc, Salt Lake City, UT). Each lysate was incubated with one PIP variant (30 μl of 50% bead slurry equivalent to approximately 200 pmoles) for 3 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with 10 vol of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling PIP beads in 3× Laemmli Sample Buffer at 95°C.  Immunofluorescence  Cells were washed with 1× PBS at room temperature, fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min, and permeabilized for 2 min in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Coverslips were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (wt/vol) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Primary antibody incubation was done for 1 hr in blocking solution, followed by five 1× PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 washes. Secondary antibody incubation was carried out for 1 hr followed by five washes and incubated with DAPI for 2 min to visualize DNA. Fluorescent images were acquired on an upright microscope (Axio imager; Carl Zeiss) equipped with 100× oil objectives, NA of 1.45, a camera (ORCA ER; Hamamatsu Photonics), and a computer loaded with image-processing software (Axiovision).  For confocal analysis, EBC1 cells were plated on fibronectin coated coverslips, washed with 1× PBS, fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Coverslips were then incubated in blocking solution (10% donkey serum, 0.1% BSA in PBS) for 1 hr, followed by incubation with a primary antibody (anti-HA) in blocking solution for 1 hr. Alexa-488 anti-mouse antibodies were used for detection. Coverslips were then incubated with Phalloidin 546 for 30 min. Nuclei were stained with DAPI for 3 min. Coverslips were then mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade reagent and images were acquired with a 40× magnification lens in a Leica TCS-SP5 (WLL) multiphoton confocal microscope.  
1352||The serine–threonine kinase AKT regulates proliferation and survival by phosphorylating a network of protein substrates. In this study, we describe a kinase-independent function of AKT. In cancer cells harboring gain-of-function alterations in MET, HER2, or Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K), catalytically inactive AKT (K179M) protected from drug induced cell death in a PH-domain dependent manner. An AKT kinase domain mutant found in human melanoma (G161V) lacked enzymatic activity in vitro and in AKT1/AKT2 double knockout cells, but promoted growth factor independent survival of primary human melanocytes. ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors failed to block the kinase-independent function of AKT, a liability that limits their effectiveness compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors. Our results broaden the current view of AKT function and have important implications for the development of AKT inhibitors for cancer.  DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03751.001  Research organism: human, mouse Go to: eLife digest To maintain a healthy body, the ability of our cells to survive and divide is normally strictly controlled. If any cells manage to escape these restrictions, they may rapidly divide and form tumors, which can lead to cancer.  A protein called AKT can encourage cells to survive and divide, and in healthy cells it is only allowed to be active at specific times. However, in many cancer cells, the genes that make and control AKT activity can be altered by mutations, which can result in AKT being active at the wrong times.  Part of the AKT protein acts as an enzyme called a kinase and adds chemical groups called phosphates to other proteins. The phosphate groups can activate or deactivate these proteins to control cell survival and cell division. However, there are other sections to the AKT protein and it is not clear how they are involved in this protein's activity.  In this study, Vivanco et al. show that AKT has another role in cell survival that does not depend on its kinase. The experiments show that even when the kinase part of the protein is missing, AKT can help cancer cells to survive drug treatments and external conditions that would normally kill them. This role requires another section of the protein called the PH-domain.  There are several chemicals—called inhibitors—that can stop AKT from working properly, and they have the potential to be used to treat some types of cancer. These inhibitors work in different ways: some were able to block the activity of the kinase, but others inhibited AKT by binding to other parts of the protein. Therefore, to develop AKT inhibitors into effective drugs, it will be important to know precisely what role the protein plays in different types of cancers.  DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03751.002  Go to: Introduction The serine–threonine kinase AKT is a non-receptor kinase that plays critical roles in growth and metabolism (Pearce et al., 2010). AKT is aberrantly activated in many human cancers, usually due to mutations in upstream components of the Phosphatidyl-Inositol-3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway. AKT signaling is required for tumor maintenance in certain genetic contexts, as has been shown for some cancer cell lines harboring PI3K mutations or amplification of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase (She et al., 2008). Encouraged by these results, several ATP-competitive and allosteric AKT inhibitors have been identified (Engelman, 2009), but optimal strategies for the clinical development of these agents are currently unknown.  Go to: Results To address this question, we compared the activity of the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206 (Hirai et al., 2010) with the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors GSK690693 (Heerding et al., 2008; Rhodes et al., 2008) and GDC0068 (Lin et al., 2013). Each of these AKT inhibitors dose dependently inhibited AKT kinase activity in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line EBC1 as determined by phosphorylation of three AKT substrates (PRAS40, GSK3β, and BAD) in whole-cell lysates (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Consistent with previous reports (Okuzumi et al., 2009), the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors induced hyper-phosphorylation of AKT at the two regulatory phosphorylation sites threonine 308 and serine 473. When we compared the ability of the AKT inhibitors to induce cell death using a trypan blue exclusion assay, we observed significantly greater cell death induction by the allosteric inhibitor MK2206 compared to the ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors GSK690693 (Figure 1B—source data 1) and GDC0068 (Figure 1C—source data 1) despite less complete inhibition of AKT substrate phosphorylation at these drug concentrations (Figure 1A).  Figure 1. Figure 1. Differential sensitivity of human cancer cells to different classes of AKT inhibitors. We had selected EBC1 lung cancer cells for our initial studies because they harbor amplification of MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates critical oncogenic signals through the PI3K/AKT axis (Gherardi et al., 2012). To test whether other MET-amplified human cancer cells show a similar drug response pattern, we extended our experiments to MET-amplified H1993 and H1648 NSCLC cell lines and GTL-16 gastric cancer cells. MK2206 again induced significantly more cell death than GSK690693 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 1—source data 1). In cell lines with other PI3K pathway alterations previously associated with ‘AKT-dependence’ (She et al., 2008), we also found that MK2006 induced significantly more cell death than ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors. These cell lines included breast cancer cells with HER2 amplification and/or PIK3CA-mutation (Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 3, Figure 1—source data 1). In contrast, MK2206 did not induce cell death in non-transformed bronchial epithelial cells (data not shown). MK2206 also did not induce cell death in lung cancer cell lines with activating EGFR mutations (Figure 1—figure supplement 4, Figure 1—source data 1) which have been linked with aberrant PI3K pathway activation (Engelman et al., 2005), suggesting that the mode of PI3K activation is critical in establishing AKT addiction in cancer.  To exclude the possibility that the greater cell death induction by the allosteric AKT inhibitor was due to additional effects on proteins other than AKT, we stably expressed a synthetic AKT mutant in which a residue critical for allosteric inhibitor binding (tryptophan 80) (Green et al., 2008; Calleja et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010) had been replaced by an alanine. Expression of AKT1 W80A or AKT2 W80A but not wild-type AKT1 or wild-type AKT2 completely rescued MK2206-induced cell death (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 5, Figure 1—source data 1). Western blot analysis confirmed that these AKT alleles are biochemically insensitive to MK2206 and prevented the induction of PARP cleavage, a marker of apoptosis (Figure 1—figure supplement 6, Figure 1—source data 1).  Of note, all three inhibitors were able to induce near-complete proliferation arrest (Figure 1—figure supplement 7, Figure 1—source data 1). These results demonstrate that allosteric and ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors differ in their ability to block AKT-mediated survival, and that this survival signal can be mediated by AKT1 or AKT2.  AKT regulates survival through phosphorylation of several protein substrates. We were therefore surprised that ATP-competitive inhibitors induced less cell death than MK2206 despite greater or equal inhibition of AKT substrate phosphorylation (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 8). We could not explain these results by differential effects on induction of ErbB3 expression or IGF-IRβ phosphorylation (Figure 1—figure supplement 9) which can accompany AKT inhibition and mediate resistance to AKT inhibitors (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011).  One potential explanation for our observations is that ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors might induce an AKT conformation which can serve as a platform for a kinase-independent survival signal (Figure 2A). If true, ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors might antagonize cell death induction by a variety of cell death stimuli, for example, inhibition of the MET kinase in MET-amplified EBC1 cells. We found this to be the case. Despite inducing a modest amount of cell death as single agent, GSK690693 antagonized the ability of crizotinib to kill EBC1 cells. The allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206, in contrast, did not compromise the ability of crizotinib to induce cell death (Figure 2B, Figure 2—source data 1).  Figure 2. Figure 2. Catalytically inactive AKT supports the survival of AKT-dependent human cancer cells. To provide genetic evidence for the kinase-independent AKT function, we took advantage of a synthetic AKT mutant which is catalytically inactive due to substitution of lysine by methionine at position 179 at the ATP-binding site (AKT K179M) (Franke et al., 1995). When we expressed this mutant in MCF7 breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-361 breast cancer cells and EBC1 lung cancer cells, catalytically inactive AKT (Figure 2C/D/E, Figure 2—source data 1) but not wild-type AKT (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—source data 1), protected from MK2206-induced cell death. Compared to the complete cell death protection provided by the drug-resistant W80A-AKT allele (Figure 1E, Figure 1—source data 1), the protection by the K179M-AKT allele was only partial, consistent with the coexistence of kinase-independent and kinase-dependent AKT signals.  We also used an AKT knockdown strategy to minimize the effect of AKT overexpression on the stoichiometry of the AKT signaling complex. For this purpose, we first generated EBC1 cells with doxycycline-inducible human-specific shRNAs for both AKT 1 and AKT 2 and then expressed a kinase-deficient (AKT1-K179M) AKT1 cDNA of murine origin that is partially resistant to knockdown due to mismatches in the mouse sequence. Protein levels of the hairpin-resistant AKT allele after doxycycline induction were similar to the levels of endogenous AKT in parental EBC1 cells (Figure 2F, top, lanes 6 and 8 vs lanes 1 and 3). Similar to our results with pharmacological AKT blockade, catalytically inactive AKT protected from cell death following doxycycline treatment and AKT depletion of these cells (Figure 2F, bottom, Figure 2—source data 1).  We next examined the effects of AKT inhibitors on phosphoinositide (PI) binding. In the absence of growth factors, AKT is inactive because intermolecular interactions between the pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase domain (KD) keep the kinase in a closed conformation (Calleja et al., 2009). Following growth factor stimulation, AKT shifts to an open conformation and becomes accessible to phosphorylation on threonine 308 and serine 473, a process that requires localization of AKT to the plasma membrane through the interaction with the phospholipid products of PI3K, phosphatidyl-inositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns (3,4,5)P3], and PtdIns(3,4)P2. Using a PI pull-down assay, we observed that MK2206 markedly impaired phosphoinositide binding (Figure 3A). This result is consistent with findings from structural studies that allosteric AKT inhibitors lock AKT in a closed conformation with its phospholipid binding site blocked by the kinase domain (Wu et al., 2010). In contrast to our findings with MK2206, incubation with the ATP-competitive inhibitor GSK690693 increased binding of AKT to PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 and this was associated with increased localization of AKT to the plasma membrane (Figure 3B).  Figure 3. Figure 3. Kinase-dead AKT protects from drug-induced cell death in a PH-domain-dependent manner. We next explored the structural requirements for the pro-survival signal of catalytically inactive AKT. Similar to GSK690693-bound AKT, the AKT1-K179M (or AKT2-K181M) mutant was hyper-phosphorylated at T308 (Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This phosphorylation event occurs at the plasma membrane (Stephens et al., 1998) and immunofluorescence in MCF10A and EBC1 cells confirmed that kinase-dead AKT was constitutively localized to the plasma membrane (Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 2).  To examine whether membrane localization was sufficient for the pro-survival function of AKT1-K179M, we replaced the PH-domain of AKT1-K179M by a membrane-targeting myristoylation signal and expressed this mutant in EBC1 cells. This mutant was unable to inhibit MK2206-induced cell death (Figure 3E, Figure 3—source data 1) despite being constitutively phosphorylated in the presence of MK2206 (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Lastly, we abolished the ability of the AKT1-K179M mutant to bind phospholipids by introducing a second substitution at an amino acid residue (R86) critical for binding of AKT to PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 (Thomas et al., 2002). Consistent with a loss of membrane localization, the R86A/K179M double mutant showed loss of AKT phosphorylation at threonine 308 when expressed in HCT116 cells that express no endogenous AKT (Ericson et al., 2010) (Figure 3—figure supplement 4A) and it did not protect from MK2206-induced dephosphorylation in cells which do express endogenous AKT (Figure 3—figure supplement 4B). Abrogation of phosphoinositide binding by the R86A substitution did not impair the pro-survival function of kinase-defective AKT (Figure 3F, Figure 3—source data 1). We observed a similar result with a second mutation (R25C) known to abolish phosphoinositide binding (Thomas et al., 2002) (Figure 3—figure supplement 4C, Figure 3—source data 1).  Mutations in the coding sequence of AKT are rare in human cancers but provide important insights into AKT regulation (Parikh et al., 2012). We wondered whether there was precedence in human cancer for kinase-dead AKT mutations. Our survey of published cancer sequencing data identified five AKT2 kinase domain mutations that occurred in at least two independent samples (G161V/E, R170W, I289M, H355Y, R368C/H) (Figure 4A). We engineered each of these mutations into an AKT2 expression vector and stably expressed the mutant protein in HCT116 cells with targeted deletions of AKT1 and AKT2 (HCT116-DKO). AKT2-G161V, but none of the other four kinase domain mutants, showed complete loss of in vitro AKT substrate phosphorylation, comparable to the synthetic kinase-dead K181M-AKT2 mutant included as control in our experiments (Figure 4B). Whole-cell lysates from G161V-AKT2 expressing cells showed loss of phosphorylation for the endogenous AKT kinase substrates PRAS40 and BAD (Figure 4C). In the phosphoinositide pull-down assay, AKT2-G161V showed altered phosphoinositide binding with acquired preference for PtdIns(4,5)P2, again similar to the synthetic kinase-dead AKT2 mutant (Figure 4D).  Figure 4. Figure 4. AKT mutants found in human cancer can promote cell survival independently of kinase activity. Since AKT2-G161V was found in a human melanoma sample, we explored the pro-survival potential of this mutant in immortalized human melanocytes. These cells required 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for survival in culture, as has previously been reported (Arita et al., 1992), but acquired the ability to survive in TPA-deficient media (RPMI) after stable expression of AKT2-G161V (Figure 4E, Figure 4—source data 1).  The increased PI(4,5)P2 binding of the kinase-dead G161V-AKT2 mutant (Figure 4D) was reminiscent of the most common somatic AKT mutation in human cancer (E17K-AKT1) which localizes to the plasma membrane due to increased affinity for the constitutive plasma membrane lipid PI(4,5)P2 (Carpten et al., 2007; Landgraf et al., 2008). This raised the question whether kinase activity might be dispensable for the pro-survival functions of the oncogenic E17K-AKT1 mutant. To explore this question, we compared the effects of E17K-AKT1 and a kinase-defective allele of this mutant (E17K/K179M-AKT1) in EBC1 cells. Compared to cells transduced with wild-type AKT, cells transduced with the E17K-AKT1 mutant showed residual AKT phosphorylation at equimolar concentrations of MK2206 (Figure 4F), consistent with the reported reduced sensitivity of E17K-AKT1 to allosteric ATP kinase inhibitors (Calleja et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Parikh et al., 2012). Expression of E17K-AKT1 provided partial protection from MK2206-induced cell death (Figure 4G, Figure 4—source data 1). Interestingly, the E17K/K179M-AKT1 double mutant provided a similar degree of protection as the E17K-AKT1 single mutant, suggesting that this cancer-associated PH-domain mutant can mediate survival signals independent of its catalytic activity in certain cellular contexts.  Lastly, we identified a human endometrial cancer cell line with a kinase domain mutation in AKT1 (G311D) (Barretina et al., 2012) that failed to induce phosphorylation of endogenous AKT substrates in AKT1/2 DKO HCT116 cells (Figure 5A). While knockdown of endogenous AKT1 or AKT2 resulted in growth inhibition, knockdown of AKT1 resulted in substantially greater cell death induction than knockdown of AKT2 (Figure 5B, Figure 5—source data 1), suggesting a state of addiction to signals provided by the mutant AKT1.  Figure 5. Figure 5. Endometrial cancer cells expressing endogenous kinase-deficient AKT1 are sensitive to AKT1 but not AKT2 knockdown. Go to: Discussion The work presented here represents the first example of a kinase-independent function of AKT (Figure 4H). Our findings that catalytically inactivating kinase domain mutations (AKT1-K179M, AKT2-K181M, AKT2-G161V) or ATP-competitive inhibitor binding to wild-type AKT can promote phosphoinositide binding document the critical importance of the kinase domain conformation on AKT PH-domain functions. It also suggests that hyper-phosphorylation of AKT in response to ATP-competitive inhibitors (Okuzumi et al., 2009) may not only be due to impaired phosphatase access (Chan et al., 2011) but also due to increased phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, given that the loss of phosphoinositide binding does not completely abolish the pro-survival function of kinase-deficient AKT, we suspect that the PH-domain promotes cell survival through regulation of interacting protein partners, and that perturbations in the kinase domain can influence PH-domain function by altering the ability of AKT to reach the appropriate sub-cellular compartment (likely those richest in PI(4,5)P2) and/or interact with specific effector proteins. Further studies are required to identify the effectors of catalytically inactive AKT and define its contribution to other AKT-regulated cellular processes.  Our findings have implications for the development of drugs to block AKT in cancer. Previous studies have shown that cancer-associated AKT mutations that favor an open conformation show reduced sensitivity to allosteric AKT inhibitors but retain sensitivity to ATP-competitive inhibitors (Calleja et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Parikh et al., 2012). Here, we show that cancer cells with aberrant AKT activation by common PI3K pathway lesions (HER2, PIK3CA, MET) show the opposite drug sensitivity profile with reduced sensitivity to ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors. The inability of ATP-competitive inhibitors to suppress non-catalytic AKT functions in certain genetic contexts may represent a liability compared to allosteric AKT inhibitors.

Go to: Methods Western blots  Cells were harvested directly on tissue culture plates with 1% triton cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, and normalized to equal amounts of total protein using the DC protein assay (Biorad).  Retroviral infections  For transduction of wild-type and mutant AKT alleles into EBC1, HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/−, MCF7, and MDA-MB-361 cells, amphotropic retroviruses were generated by co-transfection of retroviral constructs carrying the appropriate cDNA and the packaging plasmid pCL-Ampho (IMGENEX, San Diego, CA) into 293T cells. Viral particles were collected after 36 and 60 hr following transfection and target cells were infected for 18 hr with the respective virus. Stable expressors were derived through antibiotic selection. To immortalize human epidermal melanocytes (iHEM), primary melanocytes (ScienCell) were retrovirally infected with amphotropic pbabe-hTERT + p53DD virus using the above transduction protocol. For lentiviral transduction of Tet-inducible shRNAs targeting AKT1 and AKT2, viral particles were produced by co-transfection of shRNA constructs (listed above) with two packaging plasmids (pMD2G and pPAX2) into 293T cells. Five different viruses were generated (2 AKT1 hairpins and 3 AKT2 hairpins). Viral particles were collected at 36 and 60 hr after transfection. All five viruses were mixed, and infection of EBC1 cells was carried out for 8 hr after each virus collection. 36 hours after the last infection, cells were selected with 10 µM puromycin to derive stable expressors. Following selection, cells were also transduced with pLNCX-HA-mAKT1-K179M retrovirus and selected with 1 mg/ml G148 to generate cells with a hairpin-resistant AKT1-K179M allele.  Cell death assay  Cells were seeded on 6 cm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then treated with the indicated drugs at the indicated doses. Each treatment group was seeded in triplicate. Following treatment, both attached and unattached cells were harvested and counted on a ViCell Cell Viability analyzer. The instrument uses trypan blue to assess cell death. Cell death was expressed as the fraction of trypan blue-positive cells over the total number of cells. Statistical significance was assessed by one-tailed unequal variance t-test (ns = p > 0.05; * = p ≤ 0.05; ** = p ≤ 0.01, *** = p ≤ 0.001).  AKT kinase assay  AKT kinase assays were carried out using the non-radioactive AKT Kinase Assay Kit from Cell Signaling Technologies (Catalog #9840) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modification: HA-Tag antibody Sepharose bead conjugate was used to isolate AKT kinase. Briefly, HCT116 AKT1/2 DKO cells expressing exogenous HA-tagged AKT alleles were lysed in 1× lysis buffer and sonicated. Sonicated lysates were normalized to equal amounts of total protein. AKT was then purified from normalized lysates by HA immunoprecipitation for 3 hr at 4°C. HA beads were then washed two times with 500 µl lysis buffer and once with 1× kinase buffer. Beads were then resuspended in 50 µl kinase buffer, and kinase reaction was carried out for 30 min after addition of 1 µg of substrate and ATP to a final concentration of 200 µM. Reaction was terminated by adding 3× Laemmli buffer. 10 µl of kinase reaction were analyzed by immunoblot. Substrate phosphorylation and AKT content in each reaction was measured by immunoblot.  PIP binding assay  HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/− (with or without exogenous AKT) cells were grown on a monolayer, washed once with cold PBS, and harvested on the dish using lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, and EDTA-free protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Lysates were sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. Cleared lysates were then normalized to equal amounts of total protein. The amount of AKT in each lysate was then quantified by Western blot using an HA antibody and the lysates normalized for AKT content using image analysis of AKT immunoreactive bands. Lysate from parental HCT116 AKT1−/− AKT2 −/− cells was used to normalize a second time for total protein amount. Each lysate was then divided into 10 aliquots to verify the final normalization by Western blot and for PIP binding analysis. PIP beads were obtained from Echelon Biosciences Inc. (Echelon Inc, Salt Lake City, UT). Each lysate was incubated with one PIP variant (30 μl of 50% bead slurry equivalent to approximately 200 pmoles) for 3 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with 10 vol of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling PIP beads in 3× Laemmli Sample Buffer at 95°C.  Immunofluorescence  Cells were washed with 1× PBS at room temperature, fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min, and permeabilized for 2 min in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Coverslips were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (wt/vol) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Primary antibody incubation was done for 1 hr in blocking solution, followed by five 1× PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 washes. Secondary antibody incubation was carried out for 1 hr followed by five washes and incubated with DAPI for 2 min to visualize DNA. Fluorescent images were acquired on an upright microscope (Axio imager; Carl Zeiss) equipped with 100× oil objectives, NA of 1.45, a camera (ORCA ER; Hamamatsu Photonics), and a computer loaded with image-processing software (Axiovision).  For confocal analysis, EBC1 cells were plated on fibronectin coated coverslips, washed with 1× PBS, fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Coverslips were then incubated in blocking solution (10% donkey serum, 0.1% BSA in PBS) for 1 hr, followed by incubation with a primary antibody (anti-HA) in blocking solution for 1 hr. Alexa-488 anti-mouse antibodies were used for detection. Coverslips were then incubated with Phalloidin 546 for 30 min. Nuclei were stained with DAPI for 3 min. Coverslips were then mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade reagent and images were acquired with a 40× magnification lens in a Leica TCS-SP5 (WLL) multiphoton confocal microscope.  The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available1 . Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of ‘personalized’ therapeutic regimens2 . Human cancer cell lines represent a mainstay of tumour biology and drug discovery through facile experimental manipulation, global and detailed mechanistic studies, and various high-throughput applications. Numerous studies have used cell-line panels annotated with both genetic and pharmacological data, either within a tumour lineage3–5 or across multiple cancer types6–12. Although affirming the promise of systematic cell line studies, many previous efforts were limited in their depth of genetic characterization and pharmacological interrogation. To address these challenges, we generated a large-scale genomic data set for 947 human cancer cell lines, together with pharmacological profiling of 24 compounds across ,500 of these lines. The resulting collection, which we termed the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), encompasses 36 tumour types (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1; see also http://www.broadinstitute.org/ccle). All cell lines were characterized by several genomic technology platforms. The mutational status of .1,600 genes was determined by targeted massively parallel sequencing, followed by removal of variants likely to be germline events (Supplementary Methods). Moreover, 392 recurrent mutations affecting 33 known cancer genes were assessed by mass spectrometric genotyping13 (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). DNA copy number was measured using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (Affymetrix SNP 6.0; Supplementary Methods). Finally, messenger RNA expression levels were obtained for each of the lines using Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays. These data were also used to confirm cell line identities (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figs 2–4). We next measured the genomic similarities by lineage between CCLE lines and primary tumours from Tumorscape14, expO, MILE and COSMIC data sets (Fig. 1b–d and Supplementary Methods). For most lineages, a strong positive correlation was observed in both chromosomal copy number and gene expression patterns (median correlation coefficients of 0.77, range 5 0.52–0.94, P , 10215,for copy number, and 0.60, range 5 0.29–0.77, P , 10215, for expression, respectively; Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4), as has been described previously3–5,15. A positive correlation was also observed for point mutation frequencies (median correlation coefficient 5 0.71, range 5 20.06– 0.97, P , 1022 for all but 3 lineages; Supplementary Fig. 5), even when TP53 was removed from the data set (median correlation coefficient 5 0.64, range 5 20.31–0.97, P , 1022 for all but 3 lineages; Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 5). Thus, with relatively few exceptions (Supplementary Information), the CCLE may provide representative genetic proxies for primary tumours in many cancer types. Given the pressing clinical need for robust molecular correlates of anticancer drug response, we incorporated a systematic framework to ascertain molecular correlates of pharmacological sensitivity in vitro. First, 8-point dose–response curves for 24 compounds (targeted and cytotoxic agents) across 479 cell lines were generated (Supplementary Tables 1 and 6, and Supplementary Methods). These curves were represented by a logistical sigmoidal function with a maximal effect level (Amax), the concentration at half-maximal activity of the compound (EC50), a Hill coefficient representing the sigmoidal transition, and the concentration at which the drug response reached an absolute inhibition of 50% (IC50). Broadly active compounds, exemplified by the HDAC inhibitor LBH589 (panobinostat), showed a roughly even distribution of Amax and EC50 values across most cell lines (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the RAF inhibitor PLX4720 had a more selective profile: Amax or EC50 values for most cell lines could be categorized as ‘sensitive’ or ‘insensitive’ to *These authors contributed equally to this work. 1 The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142, USA. 2 Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. 3 Center for Cancer Genome Discovery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. 4 Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA. 5 Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, San Diego, California 92121, USA. 6 Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Emeryville, California 94608, USA. 7 Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. 8 Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland 20815, USA. {Present addresses: Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA (J.B.); Sage Bionetworks, 1100 Fairview Ave. N., Seattle, Washington 98109, USA (A.A.M.); Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA (M.F.B.). 29 MARCH 2012 | VOL 483 | NATURE | 603 ©2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved PLX4720, with sensitive lines enriched for the BRAFV600E mutation (Fig. 2a). To capture simultaneously the efficacy and potency of a drug, we designated an ‘activity area’ (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 6). The 24 compounds profiled showed wide variations in activity area, and those with similar mechanisms of action clustered together (Supplementary Fig. 7). Genomic correlates of drug sensitivity may be extracted by predictive models using machine learning techniques6,10. We therefore assembled all CCLE genomic data types into a matrix wherein each feature was converted to a z-score across all lines (Supplementary Methods). Next, we adapted a categorical modelling approach that used a naive Bayes classification and discrete sensitivity calls, or an elastic net regression analysis16 for continuous sensitivity measurements. Both approaches were applied to all compounds and genomic data with or without gene expression features (Supplementary Methods). Prediction performance was determined using tenfold cross-validation, and the elastic net features were bootstrapped to retain only those that were consistent across runs (Supplementary Methods). Out of .50,000 input features, the regression-based analysis identified multiple known features as top predictors of sensitivity to several agents (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Figs 8 and 9), with robust cross-validated performance (Supplementary Fig. 10 and 11). For example, activating mutations in BRAF andNRASwere among the top four predictors of sensitivity in models generated for the MEK inhibitor PD-0325901 (ref. 10) (Fig. 2c). Additional predictive features for MEK inhibition included expression of PTEN, PTPN5 and SPRY2 (which encodes a regulator of MAPK output). KRAS mutations were also identified, albeit with a lower predictive value (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Tables 8 and 9 and Supplementary Fig. 8). Other top predictors included EGFR mutations and ERBB2 amplification/overexpressionfor erlotinib8 and lapatinib17, respectively; BRAFV600E for RAF inhibitors (PLX4720 (ref. 18) and RAF265); HGF expression and MET amplification for the MET/ALK inhibitor PF- 2341066 (ref. 19); and MDM2 overexpression for Nutlin-3 (ref. 20) sensitivity. Variants affecting the EXT2 gene, which encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in heparin sulphate biosynthesis, were significantly correlated with erlotinib effects (Supplementary Fig. 12). This observation is intriguing in light of a report linking heparin sulphate with erlotinib sensitivity21. In addition, NQO1 expression was identified as the top predictive feature for sensitivity to the Hsp90 inhibitor 17- AAG, a quinone moiety metabolized by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). NQO1 produces a high-potency intermediate (17-AAGH2)22, and has previously been identified as a potential biomarker for Hsp90 inhibitors23. Because some genetic/molecular alterations occur commonly in specific tumour types, lineage may become a confounding factor in predictive analyses. Indeed, a classifier built using the entire cell-line data set performed suboptimally when applied exclusively to melanoma-derived cell lines (Fig. 2d), whereas a model built with only melanoma cell lines performed better (Fig. 2d). Predictive features in the melanoma-only model showed a strong overexpression of genes regulated by the transcription factors MITF and SOX10 (Supplementary Table 10), which may also help predict RAF inhibitor drug sensitivity in melanoma cell lines. Nonetheless, lineage emerged as the predominant predictive feature for several compounds. For example, elastic net studies of the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat identified haematological lineages as predictors of sensitivity (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 9). Interestingly, most clinical responses to panobinostat and related compounds (for example, vorinostat and romidepsin) have been observed in haematological cancers. Similarly, most multiple myeloma cell lines (12 of 14 lines tested) exhibited enhanced sensitivity to the IGF1 receptor inhibitor a c b CCLE Primary tumours (Tumorscape) Colorectal Lung SC Lung squam.

All rights reserved AEW541 (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Figs 8 and 9) and showed high IGF1 expression (Fig. 2f). Interestingly, elevated IGF1R expression also correlated with AEW541 sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 9). The CCLE results indicate that multiple myeloma may be a promising indication for clinical trials of IGF1 receptor inhibitors24 and that these drugs may have enhanced efficacy in cancers with high IGF1 orIGF1R expression. Whereas BRAF and NRAS mutations are known single-gene predictors of sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, several ‘sensitive’ cell lines lacked mutations in these genes, whereas other lines harbouring these mutations were nonetheless ‘insensitive’ (Fig. 2c). The elastic net regression model derived from the subset of cell lines with validated NRAS mutations identified elevated expression of the AHR gene (which encodes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor) as strongly correlated with sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor PD-0325901 (Fig. 3a). This finding was interesting in light of previous studies indicating that a related MEK inhibitor (PD-98059) may also function as a direct AHR antagonist25. We therefore hypothesized that the enhanced sensitivity of some NRAS-mutant cell lines to MEK inhibitors might relate to a coexistent dependence on AHR function. To test this hypothesis, we first confirmed the correlation between AHR expression and sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in a subset of NRAS-mutant cell lines (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 13). Next, we performed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of AHR in cell lines with high or low AHR expression (Fig. 3c). Silencing of AHR suppressed the growth of three NRAS-mutant cell lines with elevated AHR expression (Fig. 3d–f), but had no effect on the growth of two lines with low AHR expression (Fig. 3g, h). The growth inhibitory effect was confirmed with two additional shRNAs, where evidence for dose dependence was also apparent (Fig. 3i, j). We also tested the hypothesis that allosteric MEK inhibitors may suppress AHR function by measuring the effect of PD-0325901 and PD-98059 on endogenous CYP1A1 mRNA, a transcriptional target of AHR in some contexts. Both compounds reduced CYP1A1 levels in NRAS-mutant melanoma cells (IPC-298 and SK-MEL-2; Fig. 3k) but not in neuroblastoma cells (CHP-212; Fig. 3k), indicating that other factors may govern CYP1A1 expression in the latter lineage. Together, these results suggest that AHR dependency may co-occur with MAP kinase activation in some NRAS-mutant cancer cells, and that elevated AHR may serve as a a c d Drug concentration Amax –1 EC50 0 –0.5 IC50 Relative growth inhibition (%) False positive rate Average true positive rate 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Melanoma-only categorical model Global categorical model applied to all CCLE Global categorical model applied to melanoma Random Activity area 2 3 4 5 6 7 Panobinostat activity area Haematopoietic Solid P = 7.06 10–21 IGF1 expression (log2, RMA) AEW541 activity area 3456789 0 1 2 3 4 P = 5.88 10–8 P = 3.14 10–8 Multiple myeloma Other −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 e f −8 −7 −6 −5 −120 −100 −80 −60 −40 −20 0 EC50 (log10) Amax PLX4720 (BRAF V600E) PLX4720 (BRAF WT) Panobinostat b −0.3 0 0.1 Weights 100 200 300 400 Expr.

We also looked for markers predictive of response to several conventional chemotherapeutic agents (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 6) and identified SLFN11 expression as the top correlate of sensitivity to irinotecan (Fig. 4a), a camptothecin analogue that inhibits the topoisomerase I (TOP1) enzyme. SLFN11 expression also emerged as the top predictor of topotecan sensitivity (another TOP1 inhibitor; Supplementary Figs 8 and 14). Overall, 12 of 16 lineages showed significant SLFN11 associations for topotecan or irinotecan sensitivity (Pearson’s r $ 0.2, Supplementary Fig. 14b). This finding was independently validated using data from the NCI-60 collection (Supplementary Fig. 15). SLFN11 knockdown did not affect steady-state growth sensitivity profiles (Supplementary Fig. 14d–f).

All rights reserved All three Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines screened showed both high SLFN11 expression and sensitivity to irinotecan (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 14). Ewing’s sarcomas also exhibited the highest SLFN11 expression among 4,103 primary tumour samples spanning 39 lineages (Fig. 4c), suggesting that TOP1 inhibitors might offer an effective treatment option for this cancer type. Towards this end, several ongoing trials in Ewing’s sarcoma are examining irinotecanbased combinations, or the addition oftopotecan to standard regimens26. For some lineages with high SLFN11 expression (for example, cervical adenocarcinoma), topoisomerase inhibitors already comprise a standard chemotherapy regimen. In other tumours where topoisomerase inhibitors are commonly used (for example, colorectal and ovarian cancers), a range of SLFN11 expression was observed, raising the possibility that high SLFN11 expression might enrich for tumours more likely to respond. If confirmed in correlative clinical studies, SLFN11 expression may offer a means to stratify patients for topoisomerase inhibitor treatment. By assembling the CCLE, we have expanded the process of detailed annotationofpreclinicalhumancancermodels(http://www.broadinstitute. org/ccle). Genomic predictors of drug sensitivity revealed both known and novel candidate biomarkers of response. Even within genetically defined sub-populations—or when agents were broadly active without clear genetic targets—elastic net modelling studies identified key predictors ormechanistic effectors of drug response. Additional efforts that increase the scale and provide complementary types of information (for example, whole-genome/transcriptome sequencing, epigenetic studies, metabolic profiling or proteomic/phosphoproteomic analysis) should enable additional insights. In the future, comprehensive and tractable cell-line systems provided through this and other efforts27 may facilitate numerous advances in cancer biology and drug discovery.   
1756||Current genomic and biochemical analysis revealed mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes associated with several neoplasms and a novel enzymatic activity of IDH mutations to catalyze α-ketoglutarate to d-2-hydroxyglutarate, contributing to tumorigenesis. We identified a broad range of IDH1 mutations, including a previously unidentified IDH1-R132Q mutation, in cartilage tumors. Cartilage-specific Col2a1-Cre/ERT2;Idh1-R132 mutant knock-in mice developed multiple enchondroma-like lesions. These data show that mutant Idh in growth-plate cells causes persistence of chondrocytes, giving rise to enchondromas adjacent to the growth cartilage in bone.  Keywords: isocitrate dehydrogenase, cartilage tumor, hedgehog Go to: ABSTRACT Enchondromas are benign cartilage tumors and precursors to malignant chondrosarcomas. Somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes (IDH1 and IDH2) are present in the majority of these tumor types. How these mutations cause enchondromas is unclear. Here, we identified the spectrum of IDH mutations in human enchondromas and chondrosarcomas and studied their effects in mice. A broad range of mutations was identified, including the previously unreported IDH1-R132Q mutation. These mutations harbored enzymatic activity to catalyze α-ketoglutarate to d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG). Mice expressing Idh1-R132Q in one allele in cells expressing type 2 collagen showed a disordered growth plate, with persistence of type X-expressing chondrocytes. Chondrocyte cell cultures from these animals or controls showed that there was an increase in proliferation and expression of genes characteristic of hypertrophic chondrocytes with expression of Idh1-R132Q or 2HG treatment. Col2a1-Cre;Idh1-R132Q mutant knock-in mice (mutant allele expressed in chondrocytes) did not survive after the neonatal stage. Col2a1-Cre/ERT2;Idh1-R132 mutant conditional knock-in mice, in which Cre was induced by tamoxifen after weaning, developed multiple enchondroma-like lesions. Taken together, these data show that mutant IDH or d-2HG causes persistence of chondrocytes, giving rise to rests of growth-plate cells that persist in the bone as enchondromas.  Enchondromas, one of the most common benign tumors occurring in bone, are present in more than 3% of the population (1, 2). They are composed of cells derived from chondrocytes and occur as solitary lesions or multiple lesions in enchondromatosis syndromes (Ollier disease or Maffucci syndrome—in the latter, enchondromas are associated with vascular malformations). Clinical problems caused by enchondromas include pain, fractures, and skeletal deformity. There is a potential for malignant progression to chondrosarcoma that may be greater than 50% in some cases of multiple enchondromatosis (i.e., Maffucci syndrome) (3–7). Many chondrosarcomas are thought to derive from enchondromas, and such sarcomas are termed central chondrosarcomas (3).  The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is constitutively active in enchondromas and chondrosarcomas (8, 9). Hh is important in growth-plate chondrocyte differentiation, where it cooperates with parathyroid hormone-like hormone in a negative feedback loop to inhibit the differentiation of proliferative growth-plate chondrocytes (6, 10–14). Disruption of this feedback loop can result in either skeletal dysplasias with abnormal bone growth or enchondromas; 5% of enchondromas harbor mutation in parathyroid hormone-like hormone receptor (PTHR1), resulting in activation of Hh signaling (6, 10–14), and expression of a mutant PTHR1 or overexpression of the Hh-regulated transcription factor Gli2 under the Col2a1 promoter causes enchondroma-like cartilage lesions to develop adjacent to the growth-plate cartilage in mice (8).  The majority of enchondromas and chondrosarcomas harbor somatic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or IDH2 mutations (15–18). Mutations in IDH genes are common in several other neoplasms, including glioma, glioblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, angioimmunoblatic T-cell lymphoma, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (19–22). Biochemical studies in these cancer types identified a neomorphic enzymatic activity of the mutant IDH that converts α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG), which builds up to high concentrations in IDH mutant cells. d-2HG can competitively inhibit the function of a large group of α-KG–dependent enzymes and thereby, modulate a number of cellular processes, including DNA methylation, histone methylation, and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (23–25). However, how IDH mutations contribute to enchondroma and chondrosarcoma tumorigenesis is unclear.  We previously established tissue-specific Idh1 mutant knock-in (KI) mice and reported the pathological phenotypes in the hematopoietic system and the brain. Specifically, the Idh1-KI mutant mouse lines showed brain hemorrhage, increased numbers of early hematopoietic progenitors, and anemia with extramedullary hematopoiesis, which is known to progress to acute myeloid leukemia (26, 27). Here, we generated cartilage-specific Idh1-KI mice to examine the effect of mutant Idh1 on the differentiation of chondrocytes and the development of cartilaginous neoplasia.  Go to: RESULTS Human Enchondromas and Chondrosarcomas Have a Broad Variety of IDH Mutations That Results in d-2HG Production. To identify the range of IDH mutations in cartilage tumors, we assessed the presence of mutations in a cohort of 43 chondrosarcomas and 13 enchondromas. Sanger sequencing was used to genotype the tumor samples. Sequencing showed that 20 of the chondrosarcomas and 8 of the enchondromas harbored an IDH mutation. We confirmed the somatic nature of the mutations by comparing with the germ line of the patients, finding a wild-type (WT) sequence in the germ line in all cases. The most frequent mutation in IDH1 was R132C followed by R132G, R132L, R132H, and R132Q (Fig. 1A and Tables 1 and and2).2). This distribution is a broader range of IDH1 mutations than previously identified, although all of the mutations change the same amino acid residue. We further examined whether this IDH1 mutation results in the acquisition of the altered enzymatic activity capable of converting α-KG to d-2HG before conducting experiments in a genetically engineered mouse model. To quantify the d-2HG–producing neoactivity compared with a known human oncogenic mutation, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) consumption was measured using recombinant mouse IDH1-R132Q, the well-characterized human IDH1-R132H, and the WT IDH1 protein. The results revealed that the R132Q mutation confers the same neoactive ability to produce d-2HG as previously reported for R132H and other IDH1 and IDH2 oncogenic mutations (Fig. 1B and Table 3) (28). To further examine this mutation in a cell-based assay, HEK293T cells were transfected with mouse R132H, R132Q, and WT IDH1. d-2HG was greatly elevated in the culture media of both IDH1 R132Q and IDH1 R132H but not in WT IDH1-overexpressing HEK293T cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, for all tumor-associated amino acid substitutions described to date, including the previously undescribed R132Q, a mutation of IDH1 at R132 causes a gain of function that produces d-2HG.

Kinetic parameters of IDH1 R132Q and R132H Mutant Idh1 Disrupts Growth-Plate Structure. To determine how mutant Idh alters chondrocyte function in vivo, we generated conditional Idh1-KI mutant mice. A conditional Idh1-KI mouse line previously generated (29) was crossed with Col2a1-Cre transgenic mice to generate the KI mice. Unexpectedly, Col2a1-Cre;Idh1-KI pups were rarely found alive after birth. Even if the mutant mice did survive after birth, they died before weaning (Table S1). Because other cartilage-specific mutant mice are known to have dysfunction of the respiratory system, rib cage and tracheal cartilage were examined by whole-mount skeletal staining with alcian blue and alizarin red. This approach showed dwarfism in Idh1 mutant mice as well as pectus excavatum characterized by a caved-in or sunken appearance of the chest and dysplasia of tracheal cartilage (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1). These changes likely caused the early deaths in these mutant mice.  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Col2a1-Cre;Idh1-KI mice showed impaired chondrocyte differentiation. (A) Whole-mount skeletal staining with alcian blue and alizarin red in Col2a1-Cre;Idh1-KI mutant and WT littermates. Arrowhead shows pectus excavatum in the mutant mice. (B) d-2HG levels ... The Col2a1-Cre;Idh1-KI mice showed high levels of d-2HG in analysis of their limbs, whereas control mice did not (Fig. 2B). Histological analysis of the tibia showed reduced cartilage mineralization in the middle section (Fig. 2C). These mice also exhibited a disrupted columnar structure of proliferative chondrocytes, especially in the middle of the growth plate, with ectopic expression of Col10a1 (Fig. 2 D and E). This latter phenotype could be detected from embryonic day (E) 16.5 to day 0 after birth (Fig. S2). This region of the growth plate is reported to be hypoxic, and similar disruption of columnar structure has been found in Vhlh-deficient mice (30). Thus, Idh mutation has a cell-autonomous effect on chondrocytes, resulting in a cartilaginous dysplasia of the long bones, ribs, and tracheal cartilage.  Idh1 Mutations and 2HG Regulate Proliferation and Expression of Markers of Hypertrophic Differentiation. Because the fetal limbs showed a persistence of cells expressing type X collagen, we examined how mutant Idh might alter the expression of genes characteristically produced by hypertrophic chondrocytes. Chondrocytes from the mice were grown as primary cell cultures for 4 d. Cells were examined for the expression of Sox9, type 2 collagen, Runx2, and type X collagen or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation over the last 12 h of culture. They were also examined for the expression of the Hh target genes Gli1 and Ptch1, because these genes are known to be expressed in enchondromas (8). There was increased expression of genes expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes, Runx2, and type X collagen (Fig. 3A) in the cells from the mice expressing the mutation. In contrast, there was no difference in expression of Sox9 or type 2 collagen. There was also a mild increase in proliferation as detected by BrdU incorporation in the mutant cultures (Fig. 3D). WT chondrocyte cultures were then treated with 10 μM Octyl-d-2HG or l-2HG, an enantiomer of d-2HG. Treatment with either agent caused the same effect. In both cases, this treatment caused an up-regulation of Runx2 and collagen X expressions to levels similar to those observed in the mutant cultures as well as an increase in BrdU incorporation (Fig. 3 B and D). In addition, there was an increase in expression of Hh target genes in chondrocytes from mice expressing the mutant Idh1 or control chondrocytes treated with 2HG (Fig. 3E). Thus, mutant Idh1 as well as 2HG treatment result in an increase in expression of Hh target genes (genes characteristic of hypertrophic chondrocytes) and an increase in cell proliferation.  Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Idh1-R132Q and 2HG increase the expression of hypertrophic chondrocyte markers and increase cell proliferation. (A) Expression of markers of hypertrophic chondrocytes is significantly higher in chondrocytes from mice expressing Idh1-R132Q. Relative expression ... Conditional Idh Mutant Mice Develop Enchondroma-Like Cartilage Lesions. Because Col2a1-Cre;Idh1-KI mice could not survive after weaning, a tamoxifen-inducible Col2a1-Cre/ERT2 transgenic mouse line was crossed with the Idh1-KI mouse line to examine the effect of mutant Idh1 on the postnatal mouse growth plate. Tamoxifen was injected into mutant and WT littermates at 4 wk of age for 10 doses at 100 mg/kg body weight, and their skeletons were harvested 3 mo after the injection was completed. Histological analysis of their knees showed multiple enchondroma-like cartilage lesions adjacent to the growth plates (Fig. 4A). Between four and eight cartilage lesions were detected in the growth plates of each mutant knee (Fig. 4C). No lesions were observed in the control mice. Immunohistochemistry showed patchy expression of Col10a1 in the cartilage lesions (Fig. 4B), also suggesting dysregulation of chondrocyte differentiation. To determine the longer-term effect of mutant Idh1 on growth-plate cartilage, mutant mice were observed 6 mo after induction of the conditional allele. Multiple cartilage lesions were also found in knees of older Col2a1-Cre/ERT2;Idh1-KI mutant mice, although no obvious difference in size or numbers of such lesions was observed (Fig. S3).  Fig. 4.

Go to: DISCUSSION Here, we show that there is a high variability in the types of IDH mutations present in enchondromas and chondrosarcomas at IDH1 R132 and that these mutations result in the production of d-2HG. Both mutant IDH and treatment with d-2HG increase cell proliferation and the expression of genes associated with hypertrophic chondrocytes. In vivo, this mutation also results in the persistence of type X collagen-producing chondrocytes. Conditional expression of a mutant Idh in chondrocytes inhibits growth-plate chondrocyte differentiation, and driving the mutation postnatally results in an enchondroma-like phenotype, showing that the presence of the Idh mutation alone is sufficient to cause enchondromatosis.  We found a broad range of IDH1 mutations in enchondromas and chondrosarcomas, including the IDH1-R132Q mutation, which has not been previously reported to our knowledge. As has been described for all other IDH1 driver mutations, this mutation resulted in increased production of d-2HG. As such, it seems that any substitution at R132 observed in human tumors samples functions to produce d-2HG. In our cell culture studies, either a mutant Idh or treatment with d-2HG caused the same changes in gene expression and an increase in cell proliferation.  Data from enchondromas in humans and mice overexpressing Gli2 or a mutant PTHR1 in chondrocytes show that these tumors consist of rests of cartilage that persist in the ends of bone. These cells proliferate slowly as the animals mature but then do not enlarge over time after skeletal maturity (8). This phenotype is similar to what we observed in the Idh mutant mice. As such, persistence of hypertrophic chondrocytes likely allows rests of growth-plate cells to remain near the end of the bone, resulting in enchondromas. The mild proliferative advantage that we observed is likely enough to maintain these chondrocytes, preventing their normal replacement by bone, but does not result in a lesion that grows with time.  Previous studies found IDH mutations in a variety of benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumors, including osteosarcomas and giant cell tumors of bone (16, 31, 32). Furthermore, the mouse mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2 expressing the IDH2 R172K mutation can give rise to poorly differentiated sarcomas in xenograft models (17). Although IDH mutations can be found in a number of neoplastic conditions, they may not be causative in all. Because IDH mutations are present in both enchondromas and chondrosarcomas and expression of mutant Idh in mice results in the development of enchondroma-like lesions, not chondrosarcomas, it is likely that the mutation is causative for the benign precursor lesion, and additional mutations are needed for malignant progression. This notion is supported by the overall low frequency of genes harboring mutations in chondrosarcomas (33). This finding is consistent with previous data from mice overexpressing the Gli2 transcription factor, which develop enchondroma-like lesions but when crossed with mice deficient in p53, develop chondrosarcomas (34). Indeed, we found reregulation of Hh target genes with expression of the mutant receptor, and the phenotype that we observed was identical to that seen with overexpression of Gli2 in chondrocytes. The fatal nature of driving the mutation during development supports the concept that a somatic event during growth causes this lesion.  We found that a mutant IDH and 2HG result in a persistence of hypertrophic chondrocytes. This finding is consistent with data from a genetically modified mouse, in which Gli2 transcriptional activation inhibits chondrocyte differentiation, causing enchondromas (8), which show a similar phenotype. 2HG causes persistence of growth-plate chondrocytes, resulting in enchondromas, which then could undergo additional genetic events to become chondrosarcomas. This etiology raises the possibility that therapies to drive terminal differentiation could be used to treat these tumors, for which there are no current universally effective therapies. Because IDH mutants produce d-2HG that inhibits differentiation, IDH-targeted therapy is one such potential approach. Future experiments will evaluate the effects of mutant IDH inhibitors in this model and others of IDH-driven disease.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Sequencing. All human chondrosarcoma samples were coded and handled according to the ethical guidelines of the host institutions. Genomic DNA from frozen tumors was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Capillary Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze the samples for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations after PCR amplification on exon 4 of IDH1 and IDH2. Standard cloning followed by Sanger sequencing was used to confirm sequencing results for the R132Q mutation.  Animals. Idh1-KI (27), Col2a1-Cre (35), and Col2a1-Cre/ERT2 (36) have been described previously. The Idh1-KI mouse used in this study is identical to the animal previously described (27) but bears an R132Q mutation rather than an R132H mutation. A mouse protocol describing the above experimental procedures was approved by the animal care committee of the Hospital for Sick Children. For analysis of perinatal skeletons, mice from E15.5 to postnatal day 1 were examined, and at least three mice of each genotype were analyzed. The tumor phenotypes between at least five littermates of each genotype and age group were compared. Tamoxifen was injected into mutant and WT littermates at 4 wk of age for 10 doses at 100 mg/kg body weight, and their skeletons were harvested 3 mo after the injection was completed.  Chondrocyte Cultures. The chondrocyte isolation protocol was modified from previously published methods. Growth plates of hind limbs from 16.5-d postcoitum embryos were isolated and incubated in collagenase type 4 solution (3 mg/mL; Worthington) for 45 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in a Petri dish (37). Cells were cultured for 4 d with or without l-2HG (Toronto Research Chemicals) or octyl-d-2HG ester (Toronto Research Chemicals). BrdU was added for the last 12 h in culture and detected immunohistochemically as previously reported (38).  Histological Analysis. Samples were fixed in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for histological evaluation. Adult mouse bones were treated with Immunocal (Decal) for decalcification before embedding. Safranin O, H&E, von Kossa, and alcian blue staining was performed using standard techniques. Col10 staining was used as a marker for chondrocyte-terminal differentiation by incubating the sections with a 1:50 dilution of anti-human recombinant Col10 (Quartett Immunodiagnostika Biotechnologie GMBH) at 4 °C overnight. For whole-mount alizarin red and alcian blue staining, embryos were stained after they were fixed in 100% ethanol and transferred to acetone as described previously (39).  Real-Time Quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted and purified using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified RNA was reverse-transcribed with QuantiTect Reverse Transcription (Qiagen). cDNAs were subjected to quantitative PCR using SYBR green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences are available on request.  IDH1 Enzymology. WT and mutant IDH1 vectors were created in the pET30A plasmid by standard PCR-directed mutagenesis; 6× His-tagged recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia coli and purified using a standard nickel column. The spectrophotometric assay for NADPH consumption was performed under the following conditions: 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% BSA, 2 mM α-KG, and 0.05 mM NADPH. The reaction was initiated by adding recombinant protein at the indicated concentration. Spectrophotometric measurement of NADPH was made directly at 340 nm over time; for determination of kinetic parameters with regard to α-KG, NADPH concentration was held constant, and α-KG was varied from 0.1 to 10 mM. For in-cell assays, HEK293T cells (ATCC) were transfected with pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vectors as indicated and allowed to grow for 24 h. Transfected cells were collected to assess protein expression by Western blot and plated to 96-well plates to measure cellular d-2HG production. After another 48 h, media were collected to measure d-2HG production by the transfected cells.  Metabolite Determinations. For d-2HG measurement, metabolites were extracted using 80% aqueous methanol as previously described (17). Briefly, 10–15 mg limb cartilage at E16.5 or 200 μL culture medium was immersed in 80% methanol at −80 °C and homogenized. Extracts were subjected to ion-paired, reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to negative-mode electrospray triple-quadrupole MS using multiple reaction monitoring. Integrated elution peaks were compared with metabolite standard curves for absolute quantification.  Mutations in metabolic enzymes, including isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2, in cancer strongly implicate altered metabolism in tumorigenesis. IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze the interconversion of isocitrate and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). 2OG is a TCA cycle intermediate and an essential cofactor for many enzymes, including JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases, TET 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases, and EglN prolyl-4-hydroxylases. Cancer-associated IDH mutations alter the enzymes such that they reduce 2OG to the structurally similar metabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2HG]. Here we review what is known about the molecular mechanisms of transformation by mutant IDH and discuss their implications for the development of targeted therapies to treat IDH mutant malignancies.  Keywords: 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, cancer metabolism, chondrosarcoma, glioma, isocitrate dehydrogenase, leukemia Cellular metabolism has been hypothesized to play a central role in cancer since the observation made almost a century ago by Otto Warburg (Warburg 1956) that cancer cells preferentially generate energy by metabolizing glucose to lactate. Even in the presence of oxygen, cancer cells switch from generating ATP by the highly energy-efficient process of oxidative phosphorylation to the much less efficient process of glycolysis (Vander Heiden et al. 2009; Dang 2012). Why this switch occurs has long been a mystery, although the observation that normal cells use “aerobic glycolysis” during periods of increased proliferation supports the hypothesis that this metabolic switch is an important feature of rapidly dividing cells (Locasale and Cantley 2011; Lunt and Vander Heiden 2011). Recent work suggests that aerobic glycolysis facilitates cellular transformation by producing the high levels of glycolytic intermediates that proliferating cells need for the biosynthesis of lipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids. Moreover, metabolic reprogramming appears to be sufficient to mediate tumorigenesis in some systems (Lyssiotis and Cantley 2012; Sebastian et al. 2012). Nevertheless, whether altered cellular metabolism is a cause of cancer or merely an adaptive response of cancer cells in the face of accelerated cell proliferation is still a topic of some debate.  The recent identification of cancer-associated mutations in three metabolic enzymes suggests that altered cellular metabolism can indeed be a cause of some cancers (Pollard et al. 2003; King et al. 2006; Raimundo et al. 2011). Two of these enzymes, fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), are bone fide tumor suppressors, and loss-of-function mutations in FH and SDH have been identified in various cancers, including renal cell carcinomas and paragangliomas. The third mutated enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), is a more complicated case. Mutations in two isoforms of IDH, IDH1 and IDH2, are common in a diverse array of cancers, including gliomas and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (Dang et al. 2010). The mutant enzymes are not catalytically inactive. Rather, the cancer-associated mutations alter the catalytic activity of the enzymes such that they produce high levels of a metabolite, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2HG], which is normally found at very low levels in cells (Dang et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2010). How this aberrant enzymatic activity contributes to cellular transformation is an area of intense interest and some controversy, and several hypotheses have been proposed for how IDH mutations promote tumorigenesis. It has been suggested that (R)-2HG functions as an “oncometabolite” to promote cellular transformation, perhaps by altering the redox state of cells or modulating the activity of metabolic and epigenetic tumor suppressor enzymes that use the structurally similar metabolite α-ketoglutarate as a cosubstrate (Reitman and Yan 2010; Yen et al. 2010; Kaelin 2011). Others have posited that loss of IDH activity from either loss of the wild-type allele or gain of a dominant-negative mutant allele alters normal mitochondrial function and promotes the metabolic switch of cancer cells to glycolysis (Leonardi et al. 2012; Oermann et al. 2012).  Here, we review the spectrum of tumors that harbor IDH mutations and discuss what has been learned to date about how mutant IDH and (R)-2HG contribute to tumorigenesis. We also discuss the potential of mutant IDH as a therapeutic target in cancer and discuss some of the outstanding questions about mutant IDH biology that warrant further investigation.  Go to: Normal functions of the IDH family of metabolic enzymes Eukaryotic cells express three different isoforms of IDH (Fig. 1; Dalziel 1980). IDH1 and IDH2 are homodimeric NADP+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to produce α-ketoglutarate (also known as 2-oxoglutarate [2OG]), NADPH, and CO2 (Fig. 2). IDH3 is a structurally unrelated heterotetrameric NAD+-dependent enzyme that similarly decarboxylates isocitrate and produces 2OG, NADH, and CO2. The reactions catalyzed by IDH1 and IDH2 are reversible, and the directionality of the reactions therefore depends in large part on the relative Km values of the forward and reverse reactions and the relative levels of isocitrate and 2OG in the cell (Lemons et al. 2010). The reaction catalyzed by IDH3, on the other hand, is irreversible under physiologic conditions and is principally regulated by substrate availability and positive and negative allosteric effectors. Calcium, ADP, and citrate activate IDH3, whereas ATP, NADH, and NADPH inhibit this enzyme (Gabriel et al. 1986).  Figure 1. Figure 1. The role of the IDH family of enzymes in the TCA cycle. Shown here are the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic reactions that involve IDH; also shown are the principal mechanisms of entry of glucose and glutamine-derived carbon molecules into the TCA cycle. ... Figure 2. Figure 2. Reactions catalyzed by wild-type and mutant IDH1 and IDH2. Wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze a two-step reaction (indicated by blue arrows). The first step involves the oxidation of isocitrate to the unstable intermediate oxalosuccinate. In this reaction, ... The different IDH isoforms have overlapping, but nonredundant, roles in cellular metabolism (Fig. 1; Mailloux et al. 2007; Reitman and Yan 2010). IDH1 localizes to the cytoplasm and peroxisomes and plays a role in promoting the activity of the numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear dioxygenases that require 2OG as a cosubstrate (Hausinger 2004). Another important function of IDH1 is the generation of nonmitochondrial NADPH. NADPH provides critical reducing equivalents needed for lipid biosynthesis and is also an essential antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress and radiation damage (Jo et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2007). Finally, as the reaction catalyzed by IDH1 is reversible, IDH1 is capable of catalyzing the reductive carboxylation of 2OG to isocitrate, which can then be further metabolized to acetyl-CoA to support lipid biosynthesis (Koh et al. 2004; Filipp et al. 2012; Metallo et al. 2012).  IDH2 and IDH3, in contrast, localize to the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 1). IDH3 plays a central role in mitochondrial respiration by catalyzing one of the rate-limiting steps of the TCA cycle. The 2OG produced by IDH3 is further metabolized to succinate, and the NADH is used by the electron transport chain to generate ATP (Barnes et al. 1971). It is not clear whether IDH2 likewise contributes to flux through the TCA cycle. Rather, IDH2 is thought to regulate energy metabolism by modulating the relative abundance of isocitrate and 2OG in the mitochondria (DeBerardinis et al. 2008). Under conditions where levels of mitochondrial glutamate are high or under hypoxic conditions when glucose-dependent citrate production is compromised, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) converts glutamate to 2OG (Sazanov and Jackson 1994; Comte et al. 2002). The resultant increase in the 2OG:isocitrate ratio favors the reverse IDH2 reaction, which results in conversion of 2OG and NADPH to isocitrate and NADP+. This isocitrate can then be fed into the TCA cycle by IDH3, which converts the isocitrate back to 2OG and produces additional NADH, or isomerized by aconitase to produce citrate. Citrate, in addition to being a TCA cycle intermediate, is a critical metabolite required for fatty acid biosynthesis. Accordingly, IDH2-mediated reductive carboxylation of 2OG plays an important role in sustaining energy production and promoting cell proliferation during periods of hypoxia (Wise et al. 2011; Filipp et al. 2012). IDH2, as an important source of mitochondrial NADPH, also plays a critical role in the protection of cells from mitochondrial-specific oxidative stress, such as that generated by the electron transport chain (Lee et al. 2004, 2007).  Go to: IDH mutations in human cancer Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly invasive brain tumor that is notoriously refractory to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In 2008, in an effort to identify novel therapeutic targets in GBM, Parsons et al. (2008) undertook a landmark genomic sequencing effort of 22 adult primary and secondary GBM tumors. They identified recurrent somatic mutations at Arg132 of IDH1 that were present in five of the six secondary GBMs but none of the 16 primary GBMs included in the study. Several follow-up sequencing studies of malignant gliomas confirmed that IDH1 Arg132 mutations are very common in specific types of adult brain tumors, occurring in >70% of adult grade II and grade III gliomas and >80% of adult secondary GBMs (Balss et al. 2008; Bleeker et al. 2009). Moreover, many of the grade II/III gliomas and secondary GBMs that are IDH1 wild type harbor mutations at the analogous codon, Arg172, of IDH2 (Hartmann et al. 2009; Yan et al. 2009). Overall, 80%–90% of adult grade II/III gliomas and secondary GBMs harbor mutations at either Arg132 of IDH1 or Arg172 of IDH2 (Table 1; Chang et al. 2011). Conversely, <10% of primary GBMs and pediatric GBMs harbor IDH mutations, and no IDH mutations have been identified to date in brain tumors of nonglial subtypes (Balss et al. 2008; Yan et al. 2009; Capper et al. 2010; Byeon et al. 2012).  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of IDH1 and IDH2 mutant alleles in human cancers In 2009, Mardis et al. (2009) performed whole-genome sequencing of a case of normal karyotype AML (NK-AML) and identified a mutation at Arg132 of IDH1. Further sequencing efforts confirmed that IDH mutations are highly recurrent in clonal myeloid disorders. Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are present in 5%–20% of cases of de novo NK-AML and in 10%–20% of cases of secondary AML that result from leukemic transformation of “premalignant” myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) (Kosmider et al. 2010; Pardanani et al. 2010; Tefferi et al. 2010; Patnaik et al. 2012; Rakheja et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2012). IDH mutations are also present, albeit at a lower frequency (5%–10%), in chronic-phase MDS and MPN but are rare in translocation-positive AML (Mardis et al. 2009; Abbas et al. 2010). IDH2 mutations are also present in 10%–40% of cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) but are uncommon in other T- or B-cell lymphoid malignancies (Cairns et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012).  IDH mutations have been found in a number of other solid tumors besides gliomas. Over 50% of chondrosarcomas harbor IDH mutations (Amary et al. 2011a; Arai et al. 2012; Meijer et al. 2012), and IDH mutations have been linked to the pathogenesis of the enchondromatosis syndromes Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome (Pansuriya et al. 2010). Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome are rare nonhereditary pediatric cancer predisposition syndromes in which affected children develop cartilaginous tumors as their developing bones undergo endochondral ossification. Recently, sequencing analysis has determined that 40%–90% of the tumors in these patients harbor mutations at Arg132 of IDH1 or Arg172 of IDH2 (Amary et al. 2011b; Pansuriya et al. 2011). Interestingly, many of these patients develop multiple independent IDH mutant tumors but express wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 in their normal tissues. This suggests that their IDH mutations are occurring during embryonic development and that their tumors are a consequence of somatic mosaicism of mutant IDH-expressing cells. Interestingly, Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome appear to be associated with an increased risk of secondary neoplasms; in particular, gliomas and AML. IDH mutations have also been found in 10%–20% of cholangiocarcinomas as well as a few rare cases of paraganglioma, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer (Sjoblom et al. 2006; Bleeker et al. 2009; Kang et al. 2009; Gaal et al. 2010; Sequist et al. 2011; Borger et al. 2012).  Among the cancers associated with IDH mutations, the mutations appear to have a predilection for certain tumor subtypes or locations. In cholangiocarcinoma, the frequency of IDH mutations in intrahepatic tumors is 28%, whereas the frequency is only 7% in extrahepatic tumors (Borger et al. 2012). In chondrosarcomas, IDH mutations appear to be exclusive to central, periosteal, and dedifferentiated tumors, with no IDH mutations having been identified to date in peripheral chondrosarcomas or other cartilaginous tumors (Amary et al. 2011a; Arai et al. 2012).  IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur at different frequencies in different tumor types (Table 1). In gliomas, >80% of IDH mutations occur at Arg132 of IDH1 and result in replacement of the arginine residue with a histidine (IDH1 R132H) (Balss et al. 2008; Yan et al. 2009; Chang et al. 2011). In cholangiocarcinomas and chondrosarcomas, IDH1 Arg132 mutations are also far more common than IDH2 Arg172 mutations, although the IDH1 mutations in these tumors most often result in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution (IDH1 R132C) (Amary et al. 2011a; Arai et al. 2012; Borger et al. 2012). This is in contrast to AML, where IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur at similar frequencies (Abbas et al. 2010; Marcucci et al. 2010; Paschka et al. 2010; Koszarska et al. 2012). The single most common IDH mutation in AML is the replacement of Arg140 of IDH2 with a glutamine (IDH2 R140Q). Interestingly, IDH2 Arg140 mutations have not been found in gliomas, cholangiocarcinomas, or chondrosarcomas. However, an IDH1 mutation analogous to Arg140 of IDH2, IDH1 Arg100, has been described in rare cases of glioma (Pusch et al. 2011). In AITL, all of the IDH mutations reported to date are IDH2 mutations, with >90% occurring at IDH2 Arg172 (Cairns et al. 2012). Why the frequency of these different amino acid substitutions is so variable in different tumors is not known. It is also worth noting that IDH1 and IDH2 mutations appear to be mutually exclusive. There are no reported cases of brain tumors harboring both mutations, and although rare cases of IDH1/IDH2 double mutant AML have been reported, it is not clear whether these mutations occur in the same or different leukemic subclones (Paschka et al. 2010).  The prognostic significance of IDH mutations is not consistent across all tumor types. In the case of GBM, IDH mutations appear to confer a more favorable prognosis, with a median survival for patients with IDH mutant GBM of 31 mo, as compared with a median survival of 15 mo for patients with IDH wild-type GBM (Yan et al. 2009; SongTao et al. 2012). Whether this difference is driven by the IDH mutational status of the tumors or reflects other fundamental biological differences between primary and secondary GBM is as yet unclear. In AML, the prognostic significance of IDH mutations is still somewhat ambiguous. Several studies have reported that IDH mutational status does not impact prognosis in AML, whereas other studies have found that IDH mutations are associated with an increased or decreased risk of disease relapse when compared with IDH wild-type disease, depending on the specific patient population examined (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2011; Rakheja et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2012). In MDS and MPN, IDH mutations have been consistently found to be markers of poor prognosis. Furthermore, the observation that the frequency of IDH mutations is higher in late stage MPN and high-risk MDS (20%) than in early stage and low-risk disease (<4%), coupled with the observation that IDH mutations are frequently present in secondary AML, has lead to speculation that IDH mutations are involved in the progression of chronic MDS and MPN to full-blown leukemia. (Tefferi et al. 2010, 2012; Thol et al. 2010; Patnaik et al. 2012).  Go to: Catalytic activity of mutant IDH When IDH mutations were first identified in cancer, they were hypothesized to contribute to tumorigenesis by causing loss of function and dominant-negative inhibition of wild-type IDH activity (Yan et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2009). However, subsequent studies found that, on the contrary, tumor-associated IDH mutations cause a gain of function (Dang et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2010). The mutations are all located in the active sites of the enzymes. Arg100 and Arg132 in IDH1 and Arg140 and Arg172 in IDH2 form hydrogen bonds with the α-carboxyl and β-carboxyl groups of isocitrate and mediate isocitrate binding (Xu et al. 2004). Mutations at these residues decrease the binding affinity of the enzyme active sites for isocitrate and increase their binding affinity for NADPH, which significantly abrogates the normal oxidative decarboxylation activity of the enzymes (Dang et al. 2009). In addition to abrogating the “forward” catalytic activity of IDH, the mutations change the conformation of the enzyme active site such that the “reverse” reaction is only a partial reaction, one in which 2OG is reduced but not carboxylated. This results in conversion of 2OG to (R)-2HG rather than isocitrate (Fig. 2). In short, IDH mutations cause the reverse IDH reaction to be favored but partially disrupted, leading to high-level production of (R)-2HG.  Interestingly, although IDH1 and IDH2 mutants both produce (R)-2HG, they appear to have somewhat distinct enzymatic properties. Cells that express mutant IDH1 accumulate less (R)-2HG than do mutant IDH2-expressing cells (Ward et al. 2013). Moreover, (R)-2HG production by mutant IDH1 is enhanced by coexpression of wild-type IDH1, whereas mutant IDH2-expressing cells accumulate high levels of (R)-2HG independent of wild-type IDH2 activity. It has been hypothesized that the lower production of (R)-2HG by mutant IDH1 is due to the fact that cytoplasmic 2OG is limiting in cells, whereas mitochondrial 2OG is not. Consistent with this model, the addition of a mitochondrial localization signal to mutant IDH1 results in enhanced (R)-2HG production. Interestingly, mutant IDH1 forms heterodimers with wild-type IDH1, but mutant IDH2 does not bind wild-type IDH2 (Dang et al. 2009; Ward et al. 2013). It has been hypothesized that heterodimerization of wild-type and mutant IDH1 in the cytoplasm provides the mutant subunit with a local source of 2OG that can then be metabolized to (R)-2HG. Consistent with this model, it has recently been reported that loss of the wild-type IDH1 allele in IDH1 mutant gliomas is associated with significantly lower tumor levels of (R)-2HG than are seen in heterozygous IDH1 mutant tumors (Jin et al. 2013).  Go to: Mutant IDH is an oncogene In a number of different in vitro transformation assays, expression of mutant IDH promotes the proliferation and inhibits the differentiation of cells. Expression of a tumor-derived IDH1 mutant (IDH1 R132H), but not a catalytically inactive form of the mutant enzyme, enhances the proliferation and soft agar colony formation of immortalized human astrocytes and confers growth factor independence and blocks the erythropoietin-induced differentiation of TF-1 cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line (Koivunen et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013). Expression of mutant IDH is also able to inhibit the differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and the differentiation of primary murine hematopoietic stem cells and immortalized murine myeloid progenitor cells (Figueroa et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013).  Although mutant IDH is able to promote cellular transformation in vitro, the mutant enzyme does not appear to be sufficient to transform primary cells in vivo. Sasaki et al. (2012a,b) have characterized the phenotype of a conditional knock-in mouse model in which they inserted IDH1 R132H into the endogenous IDH1 locus and expressed mutant IDH in either the brains or the hematopoietic systems of mice. Brain-specific expression of IDH1 R132H during embryogenesis results in perinatal lethality of the mice from cerebral hemorrhage without evidence of underlying malignancy (Sasaki et al. 2012a). Although it is possible that the mice would develop brain tumors if they lived longer, the hematopoietic-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, which have a normal life span, similarly do not develop malignancy (Sasaki et al. 2012b).  Despite the lack of a cancer phenotype in the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, the hematopoietic stem cell phenotype of the mice does provide some insights into how mutant IDH contributes to tumorigenesis. Although IDH1 R132H-expressing bone marrow cells are not immortalized, the mice do show selective expansion of their hematopoietic stem and early progenitor compartments but not their committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitor compartments. This observation is quite interesting given the distinct self-renewal properties of these different cell types. Normal committed progenitors are unable to self-renew and are consigned to undergo further differentiation, whereas stem cells and early progenitors have inherent self-renewal capabilities (Chao et al. 2008; Orford and Scadden 2008; Seita and Weissman 2010). When stem cells and early progenitors divide, they make the decision to undergo either symmetric division, in which both daughter cells are identical to the original cell, or asymmetric division, in which one daughter cell is identical to the original cell and the other is committed to undergoing further differentiation. The balance between symmetric and asymmetric cell division is crucial to cellular homeostasis. Excessive symmetric division causes inappropriate expansion of stem cell compartments, whereas excessive asymmetric division results in stem cell exhaustion (Jacob and Osato 2009; Marciniak-Czochra et al. 2009; Matsumoto and Nakayama 2013). The observation that only stem and early progenitor cells are expanded in the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice suggests that mutant IDH promotes leukemogenesis by increasing symmetric division within a population of cells that have inherent self-renewal capacity but that mutant IDH is not, by itself, able to immortalize self-renewing cells or bestow self-renewal upon more differentiated cells. This observation has important biological implications. The limited ability of mutant IDH to promote the proliferation of primary cells suggests that the specific cell lineage in which the IDH mutation occurs significantly influences the ability of the mutation to contribute to transformation. An IDH mutation in a committed progenitor cell would likely not confer a proliferative advantage to that cell, whereas the same mutation in a more primitive cell would contribute to clonal expansion.  It is also notable that hematopoietic stem cells isolated from IDH1 R132H knock-in mice are able to differentiate normally in vitro and are able to competitively repopulate the bone marrow of transplanted recipient mice. This suggests that expression of mutant IDH has little if any effect on cellular differentiation in otherwise normal hematopoietic cells. This limited ability of mutant IDH to block the differentiation of normal primary cells suggests that other specific mutations that cooperate with mutant IDH to block cellular differentiation are likely to be required to bring about the maturation arrest that is characteristic of leukemia cells.  Go to: Mutant IDH-derived (R)-2HG is an oncometabolite 2HG is a five-carbon dicarboxylic acid with a chiral center at the second carbon atom (Fig. 2). There are therefore two possible enantiomers of 2HG: (R)-2HG [otherwise known as (D)-2HG] and (S)-2HG [otherwise known as (L)-2HG]. (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG are both byproducts of normal mitochondrial metabolism (Kranendijk et al. 2012). The principal source of (R)-2HG in IDH wild-type cells is a reaction catalyzed by hydroxyacid–oxoacid transhydrogenase (HOT) (Struys et al. 2005b). HOT converts γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) to succinic semialdehyde (SSA), with concomitant reduction of 2OG to (R)-2HG. (S)-2HG is generated during conversion of oxaloacetate to (L)-malate by (L)-malate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the TCA cycle (Rzem et al. 2007).  (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG are believed to be unwanted byproducts of cellular metabolism, and their intracellular levels in normal cells are maintained at <0.1 mM. 2HG is prevented from accumulating in cells by the actions of two enzymes—(D)-2HG and (L)-2HG dehydrogenase (2HGDH)—that convert (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG, respectively, back to 2OG (Struys et al. 2005a; Steenweg et al. 2010). There is currently no known physiologic role for either enantiomer in normal metabolism.  IDH mutants exclusively produce the (R) enantiomer of 2HG, and the levels of (R)-2HG in IDH mutant tumors can be extremely elevated, ranging from 1 mM to as high as 30 mM (Dang et al. 2009; Gross et al. 2010; Choi et al. 2012). These high levels of (R)-2HG appear to be a consequence of a significant imbalance between (R)-2HG production and metabolism in tumor cells. IDH1 R132H has an estimated catalytic rate (Kcat) of 1.0 × 103 sec−1 (Dang et al. 2009), whereas recombinant D2HGDH has an estimated Kcat of 0.8 sec−1 (Engqvist et al. 2009). It is therefore likely that mutant IDH overwhelms the capacity of D2HGDH to oxidize the excess (R)-2HG back to 2OG. This model is supported by the observation that in patients with type I (D)-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D2HGA), an inborn neurometabolic disorder caused by germline mutations in D2HGDH, levels of (R)-2HG are elevated but to a much lesser extent than is observed in IDH mutant tumors (Wickenhagen et al. 2009). Type II D2HGA, which is caused by germline IDH2 R140Q and IDH2 R140G mutations, is associated with higher levels of (R)-2HG and a more severe clinical course (Kranendijk et al. 2010, 2011). Interestingly, D2HGA is not associated with an increased incidence of cancer. It is important to note, however, that many patients with severe D2HGA die in infancy and early childhood, and it is therefore difficult to make definitive conclusions about an association between high levels of (R)-2HG and long-term susceptibility to cancer.  High intracellular concentrations of (R)-2HG are sufficient to mediate the in vitro transforming effects of mutant IDH. Treatment of TF-1 leukemia cells with concentrations of a cell-permeable form of (R)-2HG that achieve tumor-relevant intracellular levels is able to recapitulate the effects of mutant IDH expression (Losman et al. 2013), and treatment of cells with cell-permeable (R)-2HG is able to inhibit the differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and immortalized murine myeloid progenitor cells (Lu et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013). Furthermore, tumor cells that harbor IDH mutations and produce high levels of (R)-2HG appear to require continuous (R)-2HG to remain transformed. Withdrawal of (R)-2HG from TF-1 leukemia cells transformed by cell-permeable (R)-2HG reverses their growth factor independence and restores their ability to differentiate (Losman et al. 2013), and inhibition of mutant IDH1 expression in glioma cell lines that harbor naturally occurring IDH1 R132H mutations impairs in vitro colony formation and in vivo tumor engraftment by the cells (Rohle et al. 2013). Finally, highly potent and specific inhibitors of mutant IDH have been developed that are able to reverse the transformation of TF-1 cells expressing IDH1 R132H and IDH2 R140Q (Popovici-Muller et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013). These inhibitors also induce the differentiation of primary IDH mutant human leukemia cells in vitro and recapitulate the effects of suppression of IDH1 R132H expression in IDH mutant glioma cell lines in vitro and in vivo (Rohle et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013). Taken together, these findings suggest that the transforming activity of mutant IDH is mediated by (R)-2HG and that (R)-2HG is necessary to maintain the transformed phenotype of tumor cells that harbor IDH mutations.  Go to: Mechanisms of transformation by (R)-2HG Several mechanisms of mutant IDH-mediated transformation have been proposed. One model for how mutant IDH contributes to tumorigenesis, and the one that has perhaps gained the most traction since the discovery of (R)-2HG, is transformation by 2OG antagonism. (R)-2HG is structurally and chemically very similar to 2OG (Fig. 2), and it has been proposed that (R)-2HG transforms cells by competitively inhibiting 2OG-dependent enzymes that function as tumor suppressors (Chowdhury et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012; Lu et al. 2012). There are ∼70 known and putative 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in the GenBank DNA database that could be relevant targets of (R)-2HG in mutant IDH-mediated transformation (Table 2).  Table 2. Table 2. List of known and putative 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in the in the GenBank DNA database TET2  The myeloid tumor suppressor TET2 is a particularly intriguing candidate to be a pathogenically relevant target of (R)-2HG in IDH mutant tumors. TET1, TET2, and TET3 are members of a family of 2OG-dependent DNA-modifying enzymes that hydroxylate 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to generate 5-hydroxymethycytosine (5hmC) (Tahiliani et al. 2009; Ito et al. 2010). The TET enzymes are also able to further oxidize 5hmC to generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) (He et al. 2011; Ito et al. 2011). Somatic mutations in TET2, including chromosomal microdeletions and missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, are common in clonal myeloid disorders, occurring in 10%–40% of cases of AML, MDS, MPN, and CMML (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2009; Delhommeau et al. 2009; Tefferi et al. 2009; Couronne et al. 2010; Chou et al. 2011). Interestingly, TET2 appears to be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. Although a subset of cases of MDS and AML present with biallelic TET2 loss, the majority of cases present with heterozygous TET2 mutations (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2009; Bejar et al. 2011; Gaidzik et al. 2012). The other TET family members are not recurrently mutated in hematopoietic malignancies, although TET1 is an infrequent MLL fusion partner in rare cases of MLL translocation-positive AML (Lorsbach et al. 2003).  TET enzymes are thought to play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by mediating the demethylation of DNA. The conversion of 5mC to 5hmC and then to 5fC and 5caC by TET enzymes results in the generation of guanine:oxidized cytosine base-pair mismatches. It has been hypothesized that these mismatches are substrates for base excision repair by thymine–DNA glycosylase (TDG) (He et al. 2011; Raiber et al. 2012). It has also been suggested that 5caC residues are substrates for an as yet unidentified enzyme that can decarboxylate 5caC to generate unmethylated cytosine (Ito et al. 2011). In either case, oxidation of 5mC by TET enzymes, followed by TDG-mediated base excision or 5caC decarboxylation, would result in DNA demethylation. Indeed, overexpression of TET2 in HEK293 cells results in decreased 5mC levels and increased 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC levels, whereas knockdown of TET1 in mouse embryonic stem cells results in decreased 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC levels (Ito et al. 2011).  Given the putative role for TET2 in DNA demethylation, it would be expected that loss of TET2 activity should impair DNA demethylation and result in DNA hypermethylation. However, different studies have found inconsistent and even contradictory associations between TET2 mutational status and DNA methylation status in myeloid diseases. One study reported that TET2 mutant AML has a DNA hypermethylation signature (Figueroa et al. 2010). Two other studies found that genomic DNA is hypermethylated in TET2 wild-type myeloid diseases and is hypomethylated in TET2 mutant myeloid diseases (Ko et al. 2010; Perez et al. 2012). In yet another study, 5hmC levels were reported to be lower in TET2 mutant CMML than in TET2 wild-type disease, but global DNA methylation was the same in both cohorts (Yamazaki et al. 2012). In this last study, when locus-specific CpG island methylation was analyzed, only 11 of 27,578 CpG sites were differentially methylated between 5hmC-low and 5hmC-high patient samples. In the 5hmC-low patient samples, of the differentially methylated CpG sites, two were hypermethylated and the other nine were hypomethylated, suggesting that 5hmC levels do not correlate with 5mC levels at all. Some of these inconsistencies may be due to technical differences in experimental approach. It is also possible that TET2 mutations alter the methylation state of DNA at specific loci and only variably alter global DNA methylation.  Although 5mC and 5hmC are the only known substrates of TET2, TET2 may have other hydroxylation substrates besides DNA that mediate its tumor suppressor functions. Moreover, the hydroxylation of 5mC and the oxidation of 5hmC by TET2 might have other functions besides being intermediate steps in DNA demethylation. It has been observed that, in some cells, 5hmC modifications are copied to daughter strands during DNA replication (Szulwach et al. 2011). This requires a considerable expenditure of energy, as the daughter strands would first need to be methylated and then hydroxylated in order to maintain parental DNA 5hmC status. It seems unlikely that there would be significant selective pressure to maintain a nonfunctional transitional state of DNA demethylation. Rather, it seems more likely that 5hmC modifications and perhaps also 5fC and 5caC modifications play specific roles in the regulation of 5mC in the regulation of gene expression, perhaps by serving as recognition sites for the binding of distinct epigenetic and transcriptional regulators. Consistent with this hypothesis, specific “readers” of 5mC, 5hmC, and oxidized forms of 5hmC have recently been identified (Mellen et al. 2012; Spruijt et al. 2013). These include the transcriptional repressor MeCP2, which preferentially binds 5mC and 5hmC; the cell cycle regulator p53, which preferentially binds 5fC; and the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, which preferentially binds 5caC. How the binding of these “readers” to modified cytosine residues contributes to the regulation of gene expression is not well understood, but it is likely that any perturbation of these interactions through imbalances in hydroxylation and oxidation of cytosine residues would have profound effects on cellular homeostasis.  There are several lines of evidence to suggest that TET2 is an important target of (R)-2HG in mutant IDH-mediated transformation. The catalytic activity of TET2 is potently inhibited by (R)-2HG in vitro (Xu et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012). Furthermore, IDH mutant brain tumors and leukemias frequently display global DNA hypermethylation signatures (Figueroa et al. 2010; Ko et al. 2010; Turcan et al. 2012). Perhaps the most persuasive evidence for a link between IDH and TET2 mutations is the observation that IDH mutations are mutually exclusive with TET2 mutations in AML (Figueroa et al. 2010; Gaidzik et al. 2012). This suggests that the two mutations act on the same leukemogenic pathways and have redundant effects on cellular transformation. Indeed, (R)-2HG enhances the transforming effects of partial inhibition of TET2. In TF-1 cells, depletion of TET2 induces growth factor independence and blocks cellular differentiation similarly to expression of mutant IDH, and this transformation by TET2 depletion is potentiated by cell-permeable (R)-2HG (Losman et al. 2013).  It is unclear whether TET2 and IDH are similarly linked in other tumors. Depletion of TET2 in immortalized human astrocytes phenocopies the transforming effects of mutant IDH expression, but TET2 mutations have not been described in brain tumors (Koivunen et al. 2012). Interestingly, TET2 promoter methylation is increased in some cases of IDH wild-type grade II/III glioma (Kim et al. 2011). Given that promoter methylation is frequently associated with transcriptional silencing, this suggests that TET2 expression and activity are lost in these IDH wild-type gliomas. Taken as a whole, these observations suggest that loss of TET2 activity by either a loss-of-function mutational event, epigenetic silencing, or inhibition of TET2 activity by (R)-2HG is a frequent and important pathogenic event in brain tumors and myeloid diseases.  The evidence that IDH and TET2 mutations function in the same oncogenic pathway notwithstanding, it is worth noting that the phenotype of the conditional TET2 knockout mouse is quite distinct from that of the IDH1 R132H knock-in mouse described above (Moran-Crusio et al. 2011; Sasaki et al. 2012b). Homozygous deletion of TET2 in the hematopoietic compartment of mice does not cause leukemia but does result in a more significant expansion of hematopoietic stem and early progenitor cells than is seen in IDH1 R132H knock-in mice. Furthermore, TET2-null hematopoietic stem cells have a marked competitive repopulating advantage in transplanted recipient mice when compared with TET2 wild-type stem cells. This increased repopulating activity is not seen with IDH1 R132H knock-in stem cells, suggesting that self-renewal is more markedly enhanced by loss of TET2 than by expression of mutant IDH. TET2-null mice also show granulocyte and monocyte precursor lineage expansion and a skewing of myeloid differentiation toward monocyte/macrophage lineages, phenotypes that are not observed in IDH1 R132H knock-in mice.  There appears to be a dose-dependent effect of loss of TET2 activity on murine hematopoiesis. Mice with heterozygous loss of TET2 show an intermediate hematologic phenotype, with a less dramatic increase in stem cell self-renewal and a less dramatic dysregulation of myeloid differentiation than is seen in the TET2-null mice. This observation raises an interesting point. If transformation by TET2 suppression is indeed gene dosage-dependent, then it is reasonable to assume that selective pressure exists for heterozygous TET2 mutant cells and IDH mutant cells to further inhibit TET2 activity. A heterozygous TET2 mutant clone could do this by mutating the remaining wild-type TET2 allele or acquiring an IDH mutation. An IDH mutant clone could do this by acquiring a TET2 mutation. Why, then, are IDH mutations and heterozygous TET2 mutations mutually exclusive? One possible explanation is that the clonal advantage conferred by loss of TET2 is less dose-dependent in human myeloid cells than it is in mice. A cell that has already partially inhibited TET2 activity by either losing one allele of TET2 or acquiring an IDH mutation might not benefit significantly from further TET2 inhibition. With this in mind, it is interesting to note that, although biallelic TET2 loss is relatively common in MDS, occurring in >25% of cases, complete loss of TET2 is not associated with a more aggressive clinical disease phenotype (Jankowska et al. 2009; Mohamedali et al. 2009; Bejar et al. 2011).  Another possible explanation for the mutual exclusivity of TET2 and IDH mutations in leukemia is that acquisition of an IDH mutation confers a clonal disadvantage to TET2 mutant cells. Cells expressing mutant IDH grow more slowly under optimal culture conditions than their parental counterparts (Seltzer et al. 2010; Bralten et al. 2011; Losman et al. 2013). This suggests that mutant IDH and (R)-2HG have growth-suppressive effects that coexist with their transforming, growth-promoting effects. Perhaps in cells that do not require mutant IDH for cell growth and survival (for example, cells in which TET2 is already mutated), the negative effects of (R)-2HG on proliferation overwhelm the positive effects of (R)-2HG on transformation. This explanation could also account for the less pronounced phenotype of the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice as compared with the TET2 conditional knockout mice. Perhaps the mild phenotype of the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice is not the result of inadequate inhibition of TET2 but rather is a reflection of the balance between the protransforming effects of (R)-2HG inhibition of TET2 and the anti-transforming effects of (R)-2HG inhibition of other, growth-promoting enzymes.  JmjC histone demethylases  The JmjC family of histone lysine demethylases is another family of enzymes that may be a pathogenically relevant target of (R)-2HG. Histone demethylases play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression (Klose et al. 2006; Shilatifard 2006). Histone methylation defines the structure of chromatin, and methylation of some histone residues (H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79) is often associated with transcriptionally active euchromatin, whereas other histone methylation marks (H3K9, H3K27, and H4K20) are usually associated with transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. The patterns of histone methylation at different genetic loci are a function of the balance between the activities of histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases, each of which binds and alters the methylation of specific histone lysine residues. Disruption of histone methylation or demethylation can have profound effects on gene expression, and JmjC histone demethylases have been linked to the pathogenesis of a number of different cancers (Cloos et al. 2008; Varier and Timmers 2011).  Several JmjC histone demethylases appear to function as tumor suppressors. The H3K36 JmjC demethylase KDM2B (JHDM1B/FBX10) is a transcriptional repressor that regulates ribosomal gene expression and represses c-Jun-mediated transcription (Frescas et al. 2007; Koyama-Nasu et al. 2007). Consistent with its putative role as a tumor suppressor, KDM2B expression is significantly lower in brain tumors than in normal brain tissue. The H3K9 JmjC demethylase KDM3B (JMJD1B) is frequently deleted in 5q− MDS and AML (Hu et al. 2001), and the H3K4 JmjC demethylase KDM5C (JARID1C) is occasionally mutated and inactivated in clear cell renal carcinoma (Dalgliesh et al. 2010; Hakimi et al. 2013). The H3K27 JmjC demethylase KDM6A (UTX) and its paralog, KDM6B (JMJD3), can also function as tumor suppressors. KDM6A cooperates with the Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein to enforce cell cycle blockade and also negatively regulates the activity of NOTCH (Herz et al. 2010; Terashima et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010). KDM6B is involved in the regulation of p53 and has been shown to promote the terminal differentiation of glioblastoma cells (Barradas et al. 2009; Sola et al. 2011).  It is possible that inhibition of tumor suppressor histone demethylases by (R)-2HG contributes to transformation by mutant IDH. In fact, (R)-2HG has been shown to inhibit the activity of many 2OG-dependent dioxygenases in vitro, including the JmjC histone demethylases KDM2A, KDM4A, KDM4C, and KDM7A (Chowdhury et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2012). Although the IC50 values for inhibition of 2OG-dependent enzymes by (R)-2HG vary considerably (ranging from 25 μM to >10 mM), it is important to remember that (R)-2HG can accumulate to millimolar levels in tumors. Moreover, overexpression of mutant IDH and treatment of cells with cell-permeable (R)-2HG has been reported to increase H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, and H3K79 histone methylation marks in cell culture models (Lu et al. 2012).  The biological significance of the histone methylation changes induced in vitro by (R)-2HG is not clear, and it is not yet known whether (R)-2HG affects histone methylation in primary human IDH mutant tumors. H3K9 trimethylation is frequently increased in IDH mutant gliomas (Vanneti et al. 2013). However, many IDH wild-type gliomas also display H3K9 hypermethylation, suggesting that aberrant histone methylation is a common finding in brain tumors irrespective of IDH mutational status. In the hematopoietic-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, bone marrow stem cells show a modest increase in methylated H3K4 levels but no change in other histone methylation marks (Sasaki et al. 2012b). Furthermore, no differences in global histone methylation are apparent in the brains of the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice (Sasaki et al. 2012a). Although this could be interpreted as evidence that (R)-2HG does not significantly affect histone methylation in vivo, it is also possible that (R)-2HG induces biologically important changes in histone methylation only at specific genetic loci that promote tumor formation. Histone methylation changes that are beneficial could be preferentially retained in mutant IDH-expressing cells, whereas deleterious changes could be reversed by compensatory changes such as down-regulation of specific histone methyltransferases.  As described above, several JmjC histone demethylases can function as tumor suppressors. However, some histone demethylases are also known to promote tumor growth. Moreover, there are multiple examples of chromatin-modifying enzymes—including histone demethylases and their opposing methyltransferases—that can act as either oncoproteins or tumor suppressors in different cellular contexts (Cloos et al. 2008). It is interesting to speculate that the different functions of the JmjC histone demethylases in different tissues could explain, at least in part, the tissue specificity of IDH mutations in cancer. If the proliferation and survival of a particular cell were dependent on the activity of JmjC histone demethylases that are potently inhibited by (R)-2HG, that cell would likely be relatively resistant to transformation by mutant IDH. Conversely, a cell in which those same JmjC histone demethylases are dispensable for proliferation or have tumor suppressor functions might be particularly vulnerable to transformation by mutant IDH.  EglN prolyl-4-hydroxylases  EglN1, EglN2, and EglN3 are members of a family of 2OG-dependent dioxygenases that regulate the activity of HIF, a heterodimeric transcription factor that mediates the cellular response to hypoxia (Kaelin and Ratcliffe 2008; Semenza 2012). In the presence of oxygen, EglN hydroxylates specific proline residues on HIFα, and these hydroxylated proline residues are then recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3–ubiquitin ligase complex. The VHL complex polyubiquitylates HIFα and targets it for proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, when intracellular levels of oxygen are low, the activity of EglN is inhibited. This permits accumulation of HIFα, which can then heterodimerize with HIFβ, translocate to the nucleus, and activate the transcriptional response of cells to hypoxia. EglN1 is believed to be the principal HIF prolyl-hydroxylase, with EglN2 and EglN3 playing variable compensatory roles in the regulation of HIF in different tissues under specific cellular conditions.  EglN enzymes were initially reported to be inhibited by (R)-2HG (Zhao et al. 2009). However, further study has shown that, on the contrary, (R)-2HG potentiates EglN activity in vitro and in vivo and blunts the induction of HIFα in response to hypoxia in cell culture models (Koivunen et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013). Consistent with this observation, IDH mutant brain tumors display decreased HIF activation compared with their wild-type counterparts (Williams et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012). It should be noted that HIFα levels are elevated in the brains of the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice (Sasaki et al. 2012a). However, these mice succumb at birth to cerebral hemorrhage, suggesting that their brain perfusion during development is abnormal. It is possible that tissue hypoxia, rather than a direct effect of (R)-2HG on EglN activity, is the cause of increased brain levels of HIFα in these mice.  Likewise, there is no evidence that HIF is activated in human IDH mutant leukemias. On the contrary, there is evidence to suggest that activation of HIF inhibits myeloid leukemia. A number of human myeloid leukemia cell lines have been reported to proliferate more slowly and undergo terminal differentiation and apoptosis upon exposure to hypoxia and upon overexpression of HIFα (Huang et al. 2003; di Giacomo et al. 2009; Zhang and Chen 2009; He et al. 2013), and inhibition of HIFα expression by RNAi blocks the differentiation of leukemia cells in response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (Zhang et al. 2008; Zhang and Chen 2009). Moreover, in a mouse model of acute promyelocytic leukemia, exposure of diseased mice to intermittent hypoxia induces leukemia cell differentiation and prolongs survival of the mice (Liu et al. 2006). These observations suggest that HIF may be a tumor suppressor in myeloid leukemia. However, it is not known whether the HIF response to hypoxia is truly blunted in IDH mutant tumors in vivo, as one would predict given that (R)-2HG can serve as an EglN agonist.  The ability of (R)-2HG to function as an EglN cosubstrate appears to play an important role in mutant IDH-mediated cellular transformation. In immortalized human astrocytes, either overexpression of EglN1 or depletion of HIF1α is sufficient to promote soft agar colony formation (Koivunen et al. 2012). Conversely, depletion of EglN1 in mutant IDH-transformed astrocytes inhibits the growth and soft agar colony formation of the cells. Intriguingly, (S)-2HG, which potently inhibits EglN in vitro, is unable to promote transformation of TF-1 leukemia cells. In fact, (S)-2HG antagonizes TF-1 cell transformation induced by TET2 loss (Losman et al. 2013). This is despite the fact that (S)-2HG is a more potent inhibitor of TET2 than is (R)-2HG (Xu et al. 2011; Koivunen et al. 2012). Depletion of EglN1 in transformed TF-1 cells reverses transformation induced by expression of mutant IDH or by depletion of TET2, suggesting that the anti-leukemic properties of (S)-2HG relate to its ability to inhibit EglN1 (Losman et al. 2013). In short, inhibition of EglN1 by (S)-2HG reverses the leukemic transformation that would otherwise ensue as a result of its inhibition of TET2 activity.  Other candidate targets of (R)-2HG  A number of other 2OG-dependent enzymes might be inhibited by (R)-2HG in IDH mutant tumors (Table 2). Three types of collagen hydroxylases—the Leprecan family of prolyl-3-hydroxylases, the P4HA family of prolyl-4-hydroxylases, and the PLOD family of lysyl-5-hydroxylases—all require 2OG for activity, and P4HA1 has been found to be inhibited by (R)-2HG in vitro (Koivunen et al. 2012). The collagen prolyl-hydroxylases mediate the hydroxylation of proline residues required for formation of the collagen triple helix (Gorres and Raines 2010), and the collagen lysyl-hydroxylases mediate the hydroxylation of lysine residues required for collagen cross-linking into stable fibrils (Bank et al. 1999). Interestingly, collagen maturation has been found to be impaired in the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, suggesting that these enzymes are targets of inhibition by mutant IDH in vivo (Sasaki et al. 2012a). Although a role for these enzymes in cancer has not been established, the observation that expression of collagen prolyl-3-hydroxylases and prolyl-4-hydroxylases is down-regulated in many B-cell lymphomas suggests that these enzymes function as tumor suppressors in some tissues (Teodoro et al. 2006; Hatzimichael et al. 2012).  Other potential 2OG-dependent targets of (R)-2HG include FIH1 (factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1), an asparaginyl hydroxylase that regulates the transcriptional activity of HIF (Mahon et al. 2001); the ABH family of DNA demethylases that are involved in DNA damage repair (Lee et al. 2005); and the RNA demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated), which is believed to be important for the regulation of cellular metabolism (Jia et al. 2008; Berulava et al. 2013).  Go to: Other possible mechanisms of transformation by mutant IDH Another proposed mechanism of transformation by mutant IDH harkens back to Warburg's mitochondrial model of oncogenesis. Warburg (1956) hypothesized that the primary defect in cancer cells is impaired mitochondrial function, which causes cells to switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Warburg's model has been somewhat discredited by the observation that mitochondrial function is not impaired in most cancer cells (Wallace 2012). However, there are data to suggest that (R)-2HG directly interferes with normal mitochondrial function. Some D2HGA patients have elevated levels of urinary lactate, suggesting that they have some degree of mitochondrial dysfunction (Kranendijk et al. 2012). Furthermore, the activity of two enzyme complexes in the electron transport chain, complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and complex V (ATP synthase), can be inhibited by (R)-2HG in vitro (Kolker et al. 2002; Latini et al. 2005). Inhibition of ATP synthase expression and activity has been observed in some cancers and is believed to directly promote cellular transformation by causing the accumulation of excess electrons that are then transferred to molecular oxygen to generate superoxide (O2−) (Willers and Cuezva 2011).  Mutant IDH-expressing cells may have an impaired ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Latini et al. 2003). Conversion of 2OG to (R)-2HG by mutant IDH consumes NADPH, and the high catalytic rate of the mutant IDH reaction could conceivably result in depletion of cellular NADPH (Yan et al. 2009; Bleeker et al. 2010). NADPH is the electron donor used by glutathione reductase to regenerate reduced glutathione, which is the principal cellular and mitochondrial antioxidant that regulates cellular redox (Kirsch and De Groot 2001; Block and Gorin 2012). Depletion of NADPH might therefore decrease the ability of cells to neutralize DNA-damaging oxygen-free radicals. NADPH also has other regulatory functions in cells that could contribute to cellular transformation. NADPH plays a role in nutrient sensing and participates in the regulation of the cellular metabolic rate (Newsholme et al. 2010; Newsholme and Krause 2012), and NADPH is also involved in the regulation of thioredoxins, enzymes that regulate the thiol-disulphide redox state and activity of several transcription factors, including NF-κB and AP1 (Arner and Holmgren 2000; Kabe et al. 2005).  Although dysregulation of cellular redox has been shown to contribute to transformation in other types of cancer, it is not clear whether NADPH and ROS are in fact dysregulated in IDH mutant tumors. Consistent with the notion that mutant IDH can perturb cellular NADPH levels, the embryonic brains of the brain-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice have a slight increase in their NADP+:NADPH ratio and slightly decreased levels of reduced glutathione (Sasaki et al. 2012a). However, the brains of the IDH1 R132H mice have lower, not higher, levels of ROS than control mice. In the hematopoietic-specific IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, the NADP+:NADPH ratio and the levels of ROS are normal in the bone marrow (Sasaki et al. 2012b). Despite the apparent lack of increased ROS in the IDH1 R132H knock-in mice, it is nonetheless possible that cellular redox dysregulation plays a role in transformation by mutant IDH. The mice may have subtle or compartmentalized, and yet pathophysiologically relevant, perturbations in their brain and bone marrow redox states that only become apparent under conditions of oxidative stress. It is also possible that otherwise normal cells have compensatory mechanisms that largely maintain redox homeostasis in the presence of mutant IDH and that these mechanisms are defective in cancer cells.  Another potential contributor to mutant IDH-mediated transformation is deficiency of wild-type IDH activity. Although most tumor-associated mutations in IDH result in (R)-2HG production, a few rare IDH1 and IDH2 mutants that do not produce (R)-2HG have recently been identified in lymphoid and thyroid tumors (Ward et al. 2012). These mutations are monoallelic and result in either decreased enzymatic activity or loss of expression of the mutant enzyme. It has not yet been determined whether these loss-of-function mutations contribute to cellular transformation or are simply passenger mutations, but they do raise the possibility that IDH haploinsufficiency in IDH mutant cells could be tumorigenic.  Go to: Therapeutic targeting of IDH mutant tumors The observation that (R)-2HG is sufficient to promote cellular transformation and that transformation by (R)-2HG is reversible suggests that inhibiting (R)-2HG production by mutant IDH would have efficacy in the treatment of IDH mutant cancers. In this regard, first-generation mutant IDH inhibitors capable of suppressing the production of (R)-2HG in vitro and in vivo have recently been reported (Popovici-Muller et al. 2012; Losman et al. 2013; Rohle et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013).  As described above, EglN activation plays a causal role in the transformation of astrocytes by mutant IDH in cell culture models and appears to play a permissive role in the transformation of TF-1 leukemia cells by mutant IDH. These findings, if proven robust, warrant further exploration of the potential of EglN inhibitors for the treatment of IDH mutant neoplasms. A number of EglN inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of anemia and tissue ischemia, some of which have advanced to human clinical trials (Robinson et al. 2008; Miyata et al. 2011; Sen Banerjee et al. 2012; Forristal et al. 2013).  Finally, it seems likely that the millimolar levels of (R)-2HG that accumulate in IDH mutant tumors also create certain liabilities for tumor cells. For example, inhibition of certain enzymes by (R)-2HG, whether they are pathogenic targets or “bystanders,” might decrease cellular fitness and hence decrease the resistance of cells to certain forms of therapeutic attack. There is some indirect evidence to support this idea. For example, introduction of mutant IDH into TF-1 cells confers a growth disadvantage to the cells under cytokine-rich conditions even though mutant IDH confers a growth advantage to the cells under cytokine-poor conditions (Losman et al. 2013). Moreover, stable expression of IDH1 R132H impedes the growth and migration of human IDH1 wild-type GBM cell lines both in vitro and in mouse xenografts models (Bralten et al. 2011). The relatively good prognosis and enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation therapy of IDH mutant brain tumors might also reflect deleterious effects of (R)-2HG in tumor cells (Houillier et al. 2010; SongTao et al. 2012; Li et al. 2013). Therefore, another strategy for tackling IDH mutant tumors could be to systematically identify and target the unique dependencies that are created in the presence of millimolar concentrations of (R)-2HG, thereby converting the oncometabolite into an Achilles' heel.  Mutations in the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are a common feature of a major subset of primary human brain cancers. These mutations occur at a single amino acid residue of the IDH1 active site resulting in loss of the enzyme’s ability to catalyze conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. However, only a single copy of the gene is mutated in tumors, raising the possibility that the mutations do not result in a simple loss of function. Here we show that cancer-associated IDH1 mutations result in a new ability of the enzyme to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(−)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Structural studies demonstrate that when R132 is mutated to histidine, residues in the active site are shifted to produce structural changes consistent with reduced oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate and acquisition of the ability to convert α-ketoglutarate to 2HG. Excess accumulation of 2HG has been shown to lead to an elevated risk of malignant brain tumors in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism. Similarly, in human malignant gliomas harboring IDH1 mutations, we find dramatically elevated levels of 2HG. These data demonstrate that the IDH1 mutations result in production of the onco-metabolite 2HG, and suggest that the excess 2HG which accumulates in vivo contributes to the formation and malignant progression of gliomas.  Mutations in the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are found in approximately 80% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas in humans 1–3. These mutations occur at a single amino acid residue of IDH1, arginine 132, which is most commonly mutated to histidine (R132H)1, 3, 4. Only a single copy of the gene has been found to be mutated in tumors 1–6. Many of the high grade gliomas with IDH1 mutations are secondary glioblastomas that have progressed from lower grade lesions 1–3, 5. When analyzed in relation to other genes implicated in brain tumors, the compiled evidence suggests that IDH1 is often the first mutation that occurs 2. While these findings suggest that IDH1 mutations are selected for early during tumorigenesis, why mutations in a single allele of IDH1 result in predilection for malignant progression is uncertain. It has been reported that the R132H mutation disrupts the ability of IDHl to convert isocitrate to αKG 3, 7, but the consequences of this impaired enzymatic activity on cellular metabolism have not been systematically analyzed. For example, while R132 IDH1 mutations might reduce the rate of cytosolic αKG production as suggested by others 7, whether IDH1 mutations can influence the enzyme’s ability to act on αKG as a substrate has not been explored. This latter activity may be particularly important for the tumorigenic role of IDH1 mutations since cytosolic αKG is in equilibrium via transamination with the glutamate that plays a unique role in glial cell physiology, and IDH1 mutations are especially prevalent in malignant gliomas.  Go to: Metabolite profiling identifies elevated 2HG levels in IDH1 mutant expressing cells To understand the impact of IDH1 mutation on cellular metabolism, we profiled metabolites to identify changes in metabolite levels in cells expressing R132 mutant IDH1 compared with cells expressing wild-type IDH1. To initiate these studies, we stably transfected U87MG glioblastoma cells, which are wild-type for IDH1, with myc-tagged wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1. Cells expressing either myc-tagged wild-type or mutant IDH1 were used for metabolite profiling experiments (Figure 1a). Metabolites extracted from exponentially growing cells were profiled by liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In initial survey analyses, full-scan LC-MS in negative ion mode (exact mass) was used to examine differences in metabolite species with an m/z between 110 and 1000. Relative quantitative data were collected for approximately 850 ions and identities were proposed by comparison with known human metabolites. Identities of > 100 species identified by a combination of exact mass and retention time match to purified standards were assigned 8. There were no significant differences between cells expressing wild-type IDH1 when compared with parental cells. The levels of most observed ions were also similar between wild type and R132H mutant IDH1 expressing cells (Figure 1b), with no significant changes found in canonical TCA cycle species (P > 0.05 for citrate, isocitrate, αKG, succinate, fumarate, and malate). However, three species were significantly more abundant in R132H mutant IDH1 expressing cells (P < 0.001 for each). The mass of the one of these ions matched precisely to 2HG (expected m/z 147.0299, measured 147.0299). The other ions co-eluted with 2HG, and had masses consistent with the sodium adduct and a dehydrated form of 2HG. Subsequent injection of 2HG standard confirmed a retention time match to the biological peak, and that it forms all three of the observed ions during LC-MS ionization (data not shown). The cellular accumulation of 2HG was quantified by targeted triple-quadrupole LC-MS-MS analysis of cell extracts (Figure 1c). The structure of 2HG is close to αKG, the product of the IDH1 enzyme. Thus, the sole metabolite identified by untargeted metabolite profiling to be markedly altered by R132H mutant IDH1 expression was also implicated by its structure to be IDHl-related.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Cells expressing human R132H IDH1 contain dramatically elevated levels of 2HG The accumulation of 2HG was not restricted to cell extracts as 2HG was found to rapidly accumulate in the medium of cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 (Figure 1d). No appreciable 2HG could be found in the medium of wild-type cells or cells transfected with wild-type IDH1 (Figure 1d). Isotope-labeling experiments on whole cells using uniformly labeled 13C-glutamine as a culture media nutrient demonstrated that the carbons in 2HG are derived from glutamine, with reasonably high overall pathway flux from glutamine through glutamate and αKG to 2HG. Moreover, labeling experiments did not demonstrate any other major alterations in central carbon metabolic flux in cells expressing R132H mutant 2HG (data not shown). The presence of a myc epitope tag did not alter activity of R132H mutant IDH1. Despite being expressed at lower levels than the myc-tagged R132H IDH1, cells transfected with untagged R132H IDH1 demonstrated a comparable increase in 2HG production (Supplementary Figure 1). To determine whether 2HG production in cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 is unique to U87MG cells, we stably expressed wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 in wild-type IDHl-expressing LN-18 glioblastoma cells (Supplementary Figure 2a). Similar to results obtained with U87MG cells, the major difference in metabolite levels observed in LN-18 cells expressing R132H mutant IDH1 was an increased level of 2HG (Supplementary Figure 2b).  Go to: Mutant IDH1 directly converts αKG to 2HG The R132H mutation has been reported to result in loss of function for enzyme activity3, 7. However, in these studies only the NADP+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to αKG was assessed. To understand how IDH1 activity is altered in cells by the presence of R132H mutant IDH1, we expressed increasing amounts of wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 separately or in combination and assessed isocitrate-dependent NADPH production and αKG-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates. Consistent with published results, expression of R132H mutant IDH1 resulted in no measurable production of NADPH from isocitrate, and isocitrate-dependent NADPH production increased with increasing amounts of wild-type enzyme (Supplementary Figure 3a, b). The ability of the wild-type enzyme to generate NADPH was decreased slightly by co-expression of the R132H mutant IDH1. Opposite results were obtained, however, when NADPH consumption was measured in the presence of αKG. NADPH consumption by wild-type enzyme was not observed, while R132H mutant IDH1 expression resulted in αKG-dependent NADPH consumption (Supplementary Figure 3c). Although the overall consumption of NADPH was slow, if anything co-expression of wild-type IDH1 with R132H mutant IDH1 facilitated the αKG-dependent consumption of NADPH. These findings demonstrate that in contrast to wild-type IDH1, R132H mutant IDH1 promotes an NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG. Furthermore, as this reduction was not inhibited by co-expression of wild-type IDH1, these data suggest that the novel activity of mutant IDH1 can persist even in the presence of a wild-type IDH1 allele. In fact, it is possible that in the case of a heterodimer of wild-type and mutant IDH1, the αKG and NADPH produced locally by the wild-type subunit could be used as substrates for the mutant subunit explaining the decrease in NADPH production observed in lysates when wild-type and mutant IDH1 are co-expressed.  To understand how R132 mutations alter the enzymatic properties of IDH1, wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 proteins were produced and purified from E coli. When NADP+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate was measured using purified wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1 protein, it was confirmed that R132H mutation impairs the ability of IDH1 to catalyze this reaction3, 7, as evident by the loss in binding affinity for both isocitrate and MgCl2 along with a 1000-fold decrease in catalytic turnover (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 4a). In contrast, when NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG was assessed using either wild-type or R132H mutant IDH1 protein, only R132H mutant could catalyze this reaction (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 4b). Part of this increased rate of αKG reduction results from an apparent increase in affinity for both the cofactor NADPH and substrate αKG in the R132H mutant IDH1 (Figure 2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that while the R132H mutation leads to a loss of enzymatic function for oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, this mutation also results in a gain of enzyme function for the NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG.  Figure 2 Figure 2 R132H mutation alters the enzymatic properties of IDH1 Reduction of the α-ketone in αKG can result in 2HG. To determine whether R132H mutant protein directly produced 2HG from αKG we examined the product of the mutant IDH1 reaction using negative ion mode triple quadrupole electrospray LC-MS. These experiments confirmed that 2HG was the direct product of NADPH-dependent αKG reduction by the purified R132H mutant protein through comparison with known metabolite standards (Figure 3a). Conversion of αKG to isocitrate was not observed. To determine the chirality of the 2HG produced, we derivatized the products of the R132H reaction with diacetyl-L-tartaric anhydride, which allowed us to separate the (S) and (R) enantiomers of 2HG by simple reverse-phase LC and detect the products by tandem mass spectrometry 9 (Figure 3b). The peaks corresponding to the (S) and (R) isomers of 2HG were confirmed using racemic and R(−)-2HG standards. The reaction product from R132H co-eluted with R(−)-2HG peak, demonstrating that the R(−) stereoisomer is the product produced from αKG by R132H mutant IDH1.  Figure 3 Figure 3 R132H mutation in IDH1 results in production of R(−)-2HG To determine whether the altered enzyme properties resulting from R132H mutation were shared by other R132 mutations found in human gliomas, recombinant R132C, R132L and R132S mutant IDH1 proteins were generated and the enzymatic properties assessed. Similar to R132H mutant protein, R132C, R132L, and R132S mutations all result in a gain-of-function for NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG (Supplementary Figure 4). Thus, in addition to impaired oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, one common feature shared among the IDH1 mutations found in human gliomas is the ability to catalyze direct NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG.  Go to: Structural studies revealed a distinct active site of R132H mutant IDH1 To define how R132 mutations alter the enzymatic properties of IDH1, the crystal structure of R132H mutant IDH1 bound to αKG, NADPH, and Ca2+ was solved at 2.1 Å resolution (see Supplementary Table 1 for crystallographic data and refinement statistics). The overall quaternary structure of the homodimeric R132H mutant enzyme adopts the same closed catalytically competent conformation (shown as a monomer in Figure 4a) that has been previously described for the wild-type enzyme 10.  Figure 4Figure 4 Figure 4 Structural analysis of R132H mutant IDH1 Two important features were noted by the change of R132 to histidine: the effect on conformation equilibrium and the reorganization of the active-site. Located atop a β-sheet in the relatively rigid small domain, R132 acts as a gate-keeper residue and appears to orchestrate the hinge movement between the open and closed conformations. The guanidinium moiety of R132 swings from the open to the closed conformation with a distance of nearly 8 Å. Substitution of histidine for arginine is likely to change the equilibrium in favor of the closed conformation that forms the catalytic cleft for cofactor and substrate to bind efficiently, which partly explains the high-affinity for NADPH exhibited by the R132H mutant enzyme. This feature may be advantageous for the NADPH-dependent reduction of αKG to R(−)-2HG in an environment where NADPH concentrations are low. Secondly, closer examination of the catalytic pocket of the mutant IDH1 structure in comparison to the wild-type enzyme showed not only the expected loss of key salt-bridge interactions between the guanidinium of R132 and the α/β carboxylates of isocitrate, as well as changes in the network that coordinates the metal ion, but also an unexpected reorganization of the active-site. Mutation to histidine resulted in a significant shift in position of the highly conserved residues Y139 from the A subunit and K212′ from the B subunit (Figures 4b & c), both of which are thought to be critical for catalysis by this enzyme family11. In particular, the hydroxyl moiety of Y139 now occupies the space of the β-carboxylate of isocitrate.  The electron density in the active site was not sufficient to assign αKG and its orientation unambiguously. We have modeled the substrate based on the available electron density, taking into consideration the coordination between the carbonyl oxygen of αKG and the calcium ion as well as an orientation of αKG that would produce R(−)-2HG, the experimental product. The model required a significant repositioning of αKG compared to isocitrate, such that the distal carboxylate of αKG now points upward to make new contacts with N96 and S94. Overall, this single R132H mutation results in formation of a distinct active site compared to wild-type IDH1.  Go to: 2HG levels are elevated in human glioma samples Our data demonstrate that mutation of R132 can result in the ability of IDH1 to generate R(−)-2HG from αKG. To determine if 2HG production is characteristic of tumors harboring mutations in IDH1, metabolites were extracted from human malignant gliomas that were either wild-type or mutant for IDH1 (see Supplementary Table 2 for summary of tumor characteristics). It has been suggested that αKG levels are decreased in cells transfected with mutant IDH17. We observe that the average αKG level from 12 tumor samples harboring various R132 mutations was slightly less than the average αKG level observed in 10 tumors which are wild-type for IDH1. This difference in αKG was not statistically significant, and a range of αKG levels was observed in both wild-type and mutant tumors (Figure 5). Similarly, a range of levels was observed for other proximal TCA cycle metabolites with no significant differences observed between wild-type IDH1 tumors and tumors with R132 IDH1 mutations. In contrast, increased 2HG levels were found in all tumors that contained an R132 IDH1 mutation (Figure 5, Supplementary Table 2). All R132 mutant IDH1 tumors examined had between 5 and 35 μmol of 2HG per gram of tumor, while tumors with wild-type IDH1 had over 100 fold less 2HG. This increase in 2HG in R132 mutant tumors was statistically significant (p<0.0001). We confirmed that (R)-2HG was the isomer present in tumor samples (data not shown). Together these data establish that the novel enzymatic activity associated with R132 mutations in IDH1 results in the production of 2HG in human brain tumors that harbor these mutations.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Human malignant gliomas containing R132 mutations in IDH1 contain increased concentrations of 2HG Go to: Discussion 2HG is known to accumulate in the inherited metabolic disorder 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. This disease is caused by deficiency in the enzyme 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, which converts 2HG to αKG12. Patients with 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase deficiencies accumulate 2HG in the brain as assessed by MRI and CSF analysis, develop leukoencephalopathy, and have an increased risk of developing brain tumors 13–15.  Furthermore, elevated brain levels of 2HG result in increased ROS levels16, 17, potentially contributing to an increased risk of cancer, and alterations in NADPH metabolism resulting from mutant IDH1 expression could further exacerbate this effect. The ability of 2HG to act as an NMDA receptor agonist may contribute to this effect 16. 2HG may also be toxic to cells by competitively inhibiting glutamate and/or αKG utilizing enzymes. These include transaminases which allow utilization of glutamate nitrogen for amino and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and αKG-dependent prolyl hydroxylases such as those that regulate Hif1α levels. Alterations in Hif1α have been reported to result from mutant IDH1 protein expression 7. Regardless of mechanism, it appears likely that the gain-of-function ability of cells to produce 2HG as a result of R132 mutations in IDH1 contributes to tumorigenesis. Patients with 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency have a high risk of CNS malignancy 15. The ability of mutant IDH1 to directly act on αKG may explain the prevalence of IDH1 mutations in tumors from CNS tissue, which are unique in their high level of glutamate uptake and its ready conversion to αKG in the cytosol18, thereby providing high levels of substrate for 2HG production. Myeloid cells also display a high ability to metabolize glutamine and recently R132 IDH1 mutations have also been described in a subset of AML19. The apparent co-dominance of the activity of mutant IDH1 with that of the wild-type enzyme is consistent with the genetics of the disease, in which only a single copy of the gene is mutated. As discussed above, the wild-type IDH1 could directly provide NADPH and αKG to the mutant enzyme. These data also demonstrate that mutation of R132 to histidine, serine, cysteine, glycine, or leucine share a common ability to catalyze the NADPH-dependent conversion of αKG to 2HG. These findings help clarify why mutations at other amino acid residues of IDH1, including other residues essential for catalytic activity, are not found. Finally, these findings have clinical implications in that they suggest that 2HG production will identify patients with IDH1 mutant brain tumors. This will be important for prognosis as patients with IDH1 mutations live longer than patients with gliomas characterized by other mutations5. In addition, patients with lower grade gliomas may benefit by the therapeutic inhibition of 2HG production. Inhibition of 2HG production by mutant IDH1 might slow or halt conversion of lower grade glioma into lethal secondary glioblastoma, changing the course of the disease.  Go to: Methods Summary R132H, R132C, R132L and R132S mutations were introduced into human IDH1 by standard molecular biology techniques. 293T and human glioma U87MG and LN-18 cell lines were transfected using standard techniques. Protein expression levels were determined by Western blot. Metabolites were extracted from cultured cells and from tissue samples using 80% aqueous methanol (−80°C) as previously reported 8. Metabolite levels in samples were determined by negative mode electrospray LC-MS. For untargeted profiling, extract components were resolved using reverse phase HPLC running and metabolites were detected in ultra-high resolution mode (resolution ~100,000) by accurate mass ion-trap MS, collecting at one scan/second over an m/z range of 110–1100. For targeted evaluation of 2HG, αKG, and other TCA intermediates, extracts were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC system and metabolites detected by triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry, using multiple-reaction monitoring. Enzymatic activity in cell lysates was assessed by following a change in NADPH fluorescence over time in the presence of isocitrate and NADP, or αKG and NADPH. For enzyme assays using recombinant IDH1 enzyme, proteins were purified from E coli using Ni affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Enzymatic activity for recombinant IDH1 protein was assessed by following a change in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm using a stop-flow spectrophotometer. Chirality of 2HG was determined as described previously9. For crystallography studies, purified R132H IDH1 was pre-incubated with NADPH, calcium chloride, and αKG. Crystals were obtained at 20°C by vapor diffusion equilibration using 3 μL drops mixed 2:1 (protein:precipitant) against a well-solution of MES pH 6.5 and PEG 6000. Patient tumor samples were obtained after informed consent as part of a UCLA IRB-approved research protocol, collected by surgical resection, snap frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The IDH1 mutation status of each sample was determined as described previously3.  Go to: Supplemental Methods Cloning, Expression, and Purification of ICDH1 wt and mutants in E coli  The open reading frame (ORF) clone of human isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (cDNA) (IDH1; ref. ID NM_005896) was purchased from Invitrogen in pENTR221 (Carlsbad, CA) and Origene Inc. in pCMV6 (Rockville, MD). To transfect cells with wild-type or mutant IDH1, standard molecular biology mutagenesis techniques were utilized to alter the DNA sequence at base pair 395 of the ORF in pCMV6 to introduce base pair change from guanine to adenine, which resulted in a change in the amino acid code at position 132 from arginine (wt) to histidine (mutant; or R132H), and confirmed by standard DNA sequencing methods. For 293T cell transfection, wild-type and R132H mutant IDH1 were subcloned into pCMV-Sport6 with or without a carboxy-terminal Myc-DDK-tag. For stable cell line generation, constructs in pCMV6 were used. For expression in E coli, the coding region was amplified from pENTR221 by PCR using primers designed to add NDEI and XHO1 restrictions sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends respectively. The resultant fragment was cloned into vector pET41a (EMD Biosciences, Madison, Wl) to enable the E coli expression of C-terminus His8-tagged protein. Site directed mutagenesis was performed on the pET41a-ICHD1 plasmid using the QuikChange® MultiSite-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA)to change G395 to A, resulting in the Arg to His mutation. R132C, R132L and R132S mutants were introduced into pET41a-ICHD1 in an analogous way.  Wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in and purified from the E coli Rosetta™ strain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as follows. Cells were grown in LB (20 μg/ml Kanamycin) at 37°C with shaking until OD600 reaches 0.6. The temperature was changed to 18°C and protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to final concentration of 1 mM. After 12–16 hours of IPTG induction, cells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (20mM Tris, pH7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 % glycerol) and disrupted by microfluidation. The 20,000g supernatant was loaded on metal chelate affinity resin (MCAC) equilibrated with Nickel Column Buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH7.4, 500mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and washed for 20 column volumes. Elution from the column was effected by a 20 column-volume linear gradient of 10% to 100% Nickel Column Buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 500 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol) in Nickel Column Buffer A). Fractions containing the protein of interest were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed twice against a 200-volume excess of Gel Filtration Buffer (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris 7.5, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM MnSO4, 10% glycerol), then concentrated to 10 ml using Centricon (Millipore, Billerica, MA) centrifugal concentrators. Purification of active dimers was achieved by applying the concentrated eluent from the MCAC column to a Sephacryl S-200 (GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) column equilibrated with Gel Filtration Buffer and eluting the column with 20 column volumes of the same buffer. Fractions corresponding to the retention time of the dimeric protein were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled for storage at −80°C.  Cell lines and Cell Culture  293T cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagles Medium) with 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected using pCMV-6-based IDH1 constructs in six-well plates with Fugene 6 (Roche) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Parental vector pCMV6 (no insert), pCMV6-wt IDH1 or pCMV6-R132H were transfected into human glioblastoma cell lines (U87MG; LN-18 (ATCC, HTB-14 and CRL-2610; respectively) cultured in DMEM with 10 % fetal bovine serum. Approximately 24 hrs after transfection, the cell cultures were transitioned to medium containing G418 sodium salt at concentrations of either 500 ug/ml (U87MG) or 750 ug/ml (LN-18) to select stable transfectants. Pooled populations of G418 resistant cells were generated and expression of either wild-type IDH1 or R132 IDH1 was confirmed by standard Western blot analysis.  Western blot  For transient transfection experiments in 293T cells, cells were lysed 72 hours after transfection with standard RIPA buffer. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with goat-anti-IDHc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc49996) or rabbit-anti-MYC tag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology #2278) and then detected with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat or HRP-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc2004). IDH1 antibody to confirm expression of both wild-type and R132H IDH1 was obtained from Proteintech. The IDH2 mouse monoclonal antibody used was obtained from Abeam.  Metabolite extraction  48h prior to profiling the appropriate culture medium was changed to identical medium with dialyzed fetal calf serum. All cells were grown in 10 cm tissue culture dishes, and the medium was replaced again with identical medium 24 h and 1h prior to metabolite extraction. All samples were harvested at a non-confluent density (1.5 – 2.0 × 106 cells). Metabolism was quenched and metabolites extracted by aspiration of media and immediate addition of 3.6 mL 80:20 methanol:water at −80°C, and transfer to a dry-ice bed to simultaneously lyse cells and quench metabolism. Cell remnants were scraped from the tissue culture dish and transferred, along with the methanol:water, into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was moved to a new tube. A 1 mL portion of the supernatant was then dried under nitrogen gas, dissolved in 100 μL of aq. LC buffer, spun at 13,000 × g for 10 min to remove any remaining debris and analyzed by LC-MS within 24h, as described below. At the time of harvest, an equivalently treated plate to each of those harvested was used to determine the total cell count, enabling subsequent normalization of LCMS signal intensities between culture dishes.  Non-targeted LC-MS  Samples were analyzed using high resolution (~100,000 fwhm resolution) exact mass ion-trap mass spectrometry in full-scan mode (1 scan/second, set to high dynamic range), coupled to liquid chromatography via negative mode electrospray ionization (−3.0 kV). The scan range was picked to avoid abundant ions like phosphate and sulfate entering the ion trap, and was set as follows: 0–3 min: no scanning, 3–5 min: 85–800 m/z, 5.0–6.7 min: 100–800 m/z, 6.7–9.0 min: 85–800 m/z, 9–16 min: 110–1000 m/z, 16–24 min: 220–1000 m/z. For chromatography, a Synergi Hydro-RP, 100mm × 2 mm, 2.1 μm particle size column was used (Phenomonex, Torrance, CA). Solvent A was 10 mM tributylamine and 15 mM acetic acid in 97% water/3% methanol. Solvent B was methanol. The gradient was (t=0–2.5 min, 0% B; t=5–7.5 min, 20% B; t=13 min, 55% B; t=15.5–18.5 min, 95% B; 19–25 min 0% B). The flow rate was 200 μL/min.  Targeted Liquid Chromatography—Mass Spectrometry, 2HG and TCA metabolite measurements  To detect secreted 2HG in culture media, 500 μL aliquots of conditioned media were collected, mixed 80:20 with methanol, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The resulting supernatant was collected and stored at −80°C prior to LC-MS to assess 2HG levels. To measure whole-cell associated metabolites, media was aspirated and cells were harvested as described above. Two different liquid chromatography (LC) separation methods were used, each coupled by negative electrospray ionization (ESI, −3.0 kV) to triple-quadrupole mass spectrometers operating in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, with MS parameters optimized on infused metabolite standard solutions. In both methods, metabolites were separated by reversed phase chromatography using 10 mM tributyl-amine as an ion pairing agent in the aqueous mobile phase, according to a variant of a previously reported method20. The first method allowed resolution of TCA metabolites: t = 0, 50% B; t = 5, 95% B; t= 7, 95% B; t= 8, 0% B, where B refers to an organic mobile phase of 100% methanol. The second method was specific for 2HG, running a fast linear gradient from 50%–95% B (buffers as defined above) over 5 minutes. In both methods, the column was a Synergi Hydro-RP, 100mm × 2 mm, 2.1 μm particle size (Phenomonex), as above. Metabolites were quantified by comparison of peak areas with pure metabolite standards at known concentration. Metabolite flux studies from 13C-glutamine were performed as described previously21.  Detection of isocitrate, αKG, and 2HG in purified enzyme reactions by LC-MS  Enzyme reactions performed as described in the text were run to completion as judged by measurement of the oxidation state of NADPH at 340 nm. Reactions were extracted with eight volumes of methanol, and centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. The supernatant was dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in H2O. Analysis was conducted on an API2000 LC-MS-MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sample separation and analysis was performed on a 150 × 2 mm, 4 uM Synergi Hydro-RP 80 A column, using a gradient of Buffer A (10 mM tributylamine, 15 mM acetic acid, 3% (v/v) methanol, in water) and Buffer B (methanol) using MRM transitions.  Cell lysates based enzyme assays  293T cell lysates for measuring enzymatic activity were obtained 48 hours after transfection with M-PER lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000g, supernatants were collected and normalized for total protein concentration. To measure IDH oxidative activity, 3 μg of lysate protein was added to 200 μl of an assay solution containing 33 mM Tris-acetate buffer (pH 7.4), 1.3 mM MgCl2, 0.33 mM EDTA, 100 μM β-NADP, and varying concentrations of D-(+)-threo-isocitrate. Absorbance at 340 nm, reflecting NADPH production, was measured every 20 seconds for 30 min on a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), Data points represent the mean activity of 3 replicates per lysate, averaged among 5 time points centered at every 5 min. To measure IDH reductive activity, 3 μg of lysate protein was added to 200 μl of an assay solution which contained 33 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.4, 1.3 mM MgCl2,25 μM β-NADPH, 40 mM NaHCO3, and 0.6 mM αKG. The decrease in 340 nm absorbance over time was measured to assess NADPH consumption, with 3 replicates per lysate.  Recombinant IDH1 Enzyme Assays  All reactions were performed in standard enzyme reaction buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5,10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.03% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). For determination of kinetic parameters, sufficient enzyme was added to give a linear reaction for 1 to 5 seconds. Reaction progress was monitored by observation of the reduction state of the cofactor at 340 nm in an SFM-400 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (BioLogic, Knoxville, TN). Enzymatic constants were determined using curve fitting algorithms to standard kinetic models with the Sigmaplot software package (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).  Determination of chirality of reaction products from enzyme reactions and tumors  Enzyme reactions were run to completion and extracted with methanol as described above, then derivatized with enantiomerically pure tartaric acid before resolution and analysis by LC-MS. After being thoroughly dried, samples were resuspended in freshly prepared 50 mg/ml (2R,3R)-(+)-Tartaric acid in dichloromethane:acetic acid (4:1) and incubated for 30 minutes at 75°C. After cooling to room temperature, samples were briefly centrifuged at 14,000g, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and resuspended in H2O Analysis was conducted on an API200 LC-MS-MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using an isocratic flow of 90:10 (2 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.6:MeOH) on a Luna C18(2) 150 × 2 mm, 5 uM column. Tartaric-acid derivatized 2HG was detected using the 362.9/146.6 MRM transition and the following instrument settings: DP -1, FP -310, EP -4, CE-12, CXP-26. Analysis of the (R)-2HG standard, 2HG racemic mixture, and methanol-extracted tumor biomass (q.v.) was similarly performed. (R)-2HG standard was obtained from Sigma and synthesized internally.  Crystallography  For crystallography studies, purified R132H IDH1 was pre-incubated with NADPH, calcium chloride, and αKG. Crystals were obtained at 20°C by vapor diffusion equilibration of 3 μL drops of mixed 2:1 (protein:precipitant) against a well solution of MES pH 6.5 and PEG 6000. A diffraction dataset with 92% completeness was collected under cryo conditions with 1.08 Å wavelength radiation on an ADSC Quantum 315R detector at Beamline X29A of the NSLS at Brookhaven National Laboratories. The dataset was integrated using HKL2000 and scaled using SCALEPACK22. A single molecular replacement solution was obtained with PHASER23 using published coordinates from wild type IDH1 in the ‘closed’ conformation as search model (PDB accession code 1T0L). Model building was performed using COOT24 and the final model was refined by the CCP4 program REFMAC525; graphics were produced using PyMOL26. Water molecules were selectively modeled into the structure based upon strong spherical electron density difference peaks, having proper coordination geometry and distance, located within the first solvent shell layer, and having B-factors <80 and electron density sigma level >1.0. After the final refinement, 92.4% of residues fit in the most favored regions in the Ramachandran plot, with 6.8% in the additional allowed regions and 0.7% in general allowed regions. The final structure model in the closed form conformation at a resolution of 2.1 Å contains three polypeptide chains of IDH1R132H each chain consisting of 425 amino acids (414 residues plus a C-term His-tag, with residues 4–410 placed into the model), three NADPH molecules, and 301 total waters.  Clinical Specimens, metabolite extraction and analysis  The collection of human brain tumor samples was approved by the UCLA IRB. Human brain tumors were obtained during surgical resection, snap frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Clinical classification and grading of the tissue was performed using standard clinical histopathology as established by the WHO. Genomic sequence analysis was deployed to identify brain tumor samples containing either wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) or mutations altering amino acid 132. Genomic DNA was isolated from 50–100 mgs of brain tumor tissue using standard methods. A polymerase chain reaction on the isolated genomic DNA was used to amplify a 295 base pair fragment of the genomic DNA that contains both the intron and 2nd exon sequences of human IDH1 and mutation status assessed by standard molecular biology techniques.  Metabolite extraction was accomplished by adding a 10× volume (m/v ratio) of −80 C methanol:water mix (80%:20%) to the brain tissue (approximately 100mgs) followed by 30 s homogenization at 4 C. These chilled, methanol extracted homogenized tissues were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 minutes to sediment the cellular and tissue debris and the cleared tissue supernatants were transferred to a screw-cap freezer vial and stored at −80°C. For analysis, a 2× volume of tributylamine (10 mM) acetic acid (10 mM) pH 5.5 was added to the samples and analyzed by LCMS as follows. Sample extracts were filtered using a Millex-FG 0.20 micron disk and 10 μl were injected onto a reverse-phase HPLC column (Synergi 150mm × 2 mm, Phenomenex Inc.) and eluted using a linear gradient LC-MS-grade methanol (50%) with 10 mM tributylamine and 10 mM acetic acid) ramping to 80 % methanohl:10 mM tributylamine: 10 mM acetic acid over 6 minutes at 200 μL/min. Eluted metabolite ions were detected using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer, tuned to detect in negative mode with multiple-reaction-monitoring mode transition set according to the molecular weights and fragmentation patterns for 8 known central metabolites, including 2-hydroxyglutarate as described above. Data was processed using Analyst Software (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and metabolite signal intensities were obtained by standard peak integration methods.  
1768||Heterozygous mutations in either the R132 residue of isocitrate dehydrogenase I (IDH1) or the R172 residue of IDH2 in human gliomas were recently highlighted. In the present study, we report that mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 are not detected in the rat C6 glioma cell line model, which suggests that these mutations are not required for the development of glioblastoma induced by N,N′-nitroso-methylurea. The effects of IDH2 and IDH2R172G on C6 cells proliferation and sensitivity to chemotherapy and the possible mechanism are analyzed at the cellular level. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations lead to simultaneous loss and gain of activities in the production of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), respectively, and result in lowering NADPH levels even further. The low NADPH levels can sensitize tumors to chemotherapy, and account for the prolonged survival of patients harboring the mutations. Our data extrapolate potential importance of the in vitro rat C6 glioma cell model, show that the IDH2R172G mutation in gliomas may give a benefit to traditional chemotherapy of this cancer and serve as an important complement to existing research on this topic.  Highlights  ► IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are not detected in the rat C6 glioma cell line model. ► IDH2 mutations are not required for the tumorigenesis of glioma. ► IDH2R172G can sensitize glioma sensitivity to chemotherapy through NADPH levels. ► IDH2R172G can give a benefit to traditional chemotherapy of glioma. ► This finding serves as an important complement to existing research on this topic.

Introduction Gliomas contain specific histologic subtypes, the most common of which are astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas. Diffuse gliomas are further classified into grade II to grade IV depending on the presence of malignant features. The grade IV glioma, commonly known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most common and aggressive type of glioma and can develop either de novo (primary GBM) or through progression from low grade tumors (secondary GBM) [1].  In humans, five genes encode three catalytic isozymes of isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH): IDH1, IDH2, and IDH3. Both IDH1 and IDH2 function as homodimers whereas IDH3 functions as a heterotetramer composed of two α, one β, and one γ subunit [2]. The function of all IDHs is to catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate (ICT) into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), which is dependent on either nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+-dependent IDH1 and IDH2) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+-dependent IDH3). However, different isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) isozymes differ in subcellular localization: IDH1 is located in the cytoplasm and peroxisomes whereas both IDH2 and IDH3 are found in mitochondria [3].  The rates of spontaneous mutations in IDH1 occured in diffuse gliomas of World Health Organization (WHO) grades II and III of astrocytic and oligodendroglial lineages and predominantly in secondary GBM were extraordinary high [4]; [5]; [6]; [7] ;  [8]. However, the frequencies of mutations in IDH2 in these gliomas were low [5]. IDH1 mutations in the gene were highly glioma specific. Only in up to 10% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) could such mutations be detected [9]; [10] ;  [11]. However, IDH2 mutations in human cancers apart from glial tumors were absent [12]. Interestingly, glioma-specific mutations in IDH1 always produced a single amino acid substitution at R132 which belonged to an evolutionary highly conserved region located at the binding site for isocitrate [13], but mutations in IDH2 were exclusively at R172 which were the analogous site to arginine 132 in IDH1 [5].  Functional studies on IDH1 found that the IDH1 mutations abrogated enzymatic activity in respect to NADPH generation [5] ;  [7], increased km of mutant IDH1 for ICT and reduced α-KG level [14]. α-KG initiated oxygen dependent degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor subunit (HIF-1α) which composed HIF-1 by forming the heterodimer with HIF-1β [15] ;  [16]. HIF-1 was the master switch of cellular adaptation to low oxygen tension and induced transcription of genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter 1 (Glut1), and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1), which were involved in angiogenesis, cell motility and invasion and energy metabolism [17]. In response to IDH1 mutations, low levels of α-KG resulted in increasing the stabilization of HIF-1α, which could contribute to tumor growth [14]. Furthermore, a recent report showed that mutated IDH1 lost the native function but rather had a gain of function enabling IDH1 to convert α-KG and NADPH into R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate [R(-)-2HG] and NADP+[18]. R(-)-2HG accumulation in patients with 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency was associated with a higher risk of malignant brain tumors [19]. However, not only did the losing native function of IDH1 hinder NADPH production, but also the newly acquired function. Low level of cytoplasmic NADPH, which resulted in impairing reduction of glutathione (GSH) and affected the thioredoxin system, might sensitize glioblastoma to irradiation and chemotherapy. Therefore, there is a question whether IDH1 mutation is beneficial for patients or not.  Although IDH2 mutations also diminished the enzyme activation [5], the function study on IDH2 mutations was needed for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients with these tumors regardless of low frequency mutations. In the present study, the effects of IDH2 and IDH2 R172G on C6 cells proliferation and sensitivity to chemotherapy are analyzed at the cellular level and the possible mechanism is discussed.  2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials  RT-PCR Kit and MutanBEST Kit are purchased from TaKaRa. pEGFP-N1 is purchased from Clontech Laboratories Inc. Rat glioma cells C6 are kindly provided by Prof. Wang (Institute of clinical medicine, Renmin Hospital, Yunyang Medical College, Shiyan, Hubei, China). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) is obtained from Gibco BRL, calf serum is from Hangzhou Evergreen Corp. Lipofactamine 2000TM is purchased from Invitrogen Company. MTT is obtained from Beijing Xiasi Biotechnology Company Ltd. All reagents used are of highest molecular grade.  2.2. Cell culture  Cell cultures are prepared and maintained according to standard cell culture procedures. The rat glioma cells C6 are cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum.  2.3. RT-PCR and sequence analysis of the IDH1 and IDH2 in C6 cells  According to the encoding region of the cDNA sequence of IDH1 (GenBank accession No. NM_031510.1) and IDH2 (GenBank accession No. NM_001014161.1), two pairs of primers, IDH1 forward primer (5′-atgtccagaaaaatccatggcggttctg-3′), IDH1 reverse primer (5′-ttaaagtttggcctgagctagtttggccttc-3′), IDH2 forward primer (5′-atggccggctatctgcgggccgtgagc-3′), IDH2 reverse primer (5′- ctactgcttgcccagagctctgtccagg -3′) are designed. The protein encoding sequences of IDH1 and IDH2 are amplified and sequenced, respectively.  2.4. Site-directed mutagenesis of IDH2 and construction of pEGFP-N1-IDH2 and pEGFP-N1-IDH2R172G  After amplifying and analyzing the full length IDH1 and IDH2 in C6 cells, we demonstrate that IDH1 and IDH2 mutations do not occur in C6 cells. Taking the cDNA which is obtained by RT-PCR of the total RNA from C6 cells as the template, we amplify the full length gene of IDH2. The IDH2 mutation R172G is performed by MutanBEST Kit. Then, two recombinant plasmids, pEGFP-N1-IDH2 and pEGFP-N1-IDH2R172G, are constructed, both of which have the oligonucleotide encoding six consecutive histidine on 5′-terminal of IDH2 ( Fig. 1A).  Construction of recombinant plasmids and sequence analysis of site-directed ... Fig. 1.  Construction of recombinant plasmids and sequence analysis of site-directed mutagenesis of IDH2. (A) IDH2 or IDH2R172G, both of which have the oligonucleotide encoding six consecutive histidine on 5′-terminal, is fused with EGFP via the Nhe I/BamH I linker. (B) The R172G mutation is obtained by site-directed mutagenesis after finding the fact that IDH2 mutations do not occur in C6 cells. Figure options 2.5. Transfection of recombinant plasmids and cytotoxicity assay  For transient transfection, cells are harvested by Trypsin/EDTA digestion, seeded on 96-well microtiter plates (Costar) and incubated for 24 h in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfection of plasmids (pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-N1-IDH2 and pEGFP-N1-IDH2R172G) is performed with Lipofactamine 2000TM according to manufacture’s instructions. In brief, cells are incubated with 400 ng plasmid DNA and 1 μL Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM over night before being analyzed. The expression status of EGFP in each group during 12–48 h post-transfection is observed by an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Japan).  The effect of IDH2R172G on cell growth is examined by a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. This assay is based on the cellular conversion of a tetrazolium salt (MTT) into a formazan product that is easily detected using 96-well plate reader. Therefore, the MTT assay is simple and sensitive in reflecting cellular survival and cellular growth, useful in cytotoxicity, cell attachment and apoptosis assays. Equivalent number of C6 cell (104 cells/well) is added to a 96-well microtiter plates, followed by adding the medium to give the final volume of 100 μL. Then, the cells are either untreated, or transfected with pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-N1-IDH2, pEGFP-N1-IDH2R172G, respectively. Cells are incubated for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h before MTT is added to each well. After 4 h of further incubation, the medium are discarded and subsequently 100 μL DMSO are added to each well. The absorbance at 490 nm of each well is recorded using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad 550, USA). Inhibition rate (IR) is calculated according to the following equation: IR(%)=(C−T)/C×100%, where T and C represent the mean optical density of the treated group and the control group, respectively. Experiments are performed three times and the average values ± SD are recorded.  2.6. Assay of enzymatic activity  C6 cells are collected 24 h after transfection, subjected to centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in cell lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. They are then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants are used to measure IDH2 activity. For each enzymatic reaction, a volume of cell lysate containing the same amount of IDH protein is added to 1 mL of assay solution containing 33 mM of Tris buffer (pH 7.6), 0.33 mM of EDTA, 0.1 mM of NADP+, 1.33 mM of manganese chloride, and 1.3 mM of isocitrate. The activity of IDH2 is analyzed through the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH, which is measured at 25 °C by spectrophotometry at 340 nm for 300 s [20].  2.7. Sensitivity test of C6 cells harboring the IDH2 mutation to chemotherapy  In the present study, we select broad spectrum antitumor drugs (adriamycin and cytarabine) and specific anti-glioma drugs (teniposide, nimustine and dactinomycin D) which are much easier to pass through the blood–brain barrier than broad spectrum antitumor drugs.  Cells are further incubated for 72 h before cell viability is assessed. The sensitivity test of C6 cells to antitumor drugs selected is performed by MTT assay. C6 cells are seeded in 96-well plates at 104 cells/well, and incubated overnight at 37 °C prior to addition of adriamycin at desired final concentrations (range from 0.1–50 μg/mL). There are four parallel holes at every dosage group and negative control group. Cells are further incubated for 48 h before cell viability is assessed, and then, hemi-inhibitory concentration (IC50) is calculated by modeling regression curve. Similarly, cytarabine (0.1–50 μg/mL), teniposide (0.1–50 μg/mL), nimustine (1–100 μg/mL) and dactinomycin D (0.001–0.1 μg/ mL) are used to treat C6 cells, respectively.  According to the values of IC50, adriamycin at different dosages (0.2 μg/mL, 0.4 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL) is used to treat C6 cells transfected with pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-N1-IDH2, pEGFP-N1-IDH2R172G for 24 h, respectively. In order to avoid the effect of the transfection reagents on cells, we select C6 cells transfected with pEGFP-N1 and untreated with drugs as negative control group. Therefore, after treating with drugs for 48 h, the sensitivity of every group to adriamycin is detected by this method. By the same way, cytarabine (0.05 μg/mL, 0.1 μg/mL, 0.2 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL), teniposide (0.05 μg/mL, 0.1 μg/mL, 0.4 μg/mL, 0.8 μg/mL), nimustine (1 μg/mL, 5 μg/mL, 50 μg/mL, 100 μg/mL) and dactinomycin D (0.001 μg/mL, 0.002 μg/mL, 0.008 μg/mL, 0.01 μg/mL) are used to treat post-transfection C6 cells, respectively.  3. Results and discussion 3.1. Mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 are not detected in the rat glioma cell line C6  The rat glioma cell line C6 was originally induced in random-bred Wistar-Furth rats by exposure to N,N′-nitroso-methylurea and was an useful experimental model system for the study of glioblastoma growth and invasion [21] ;  [22]. The sequence analysis of IDH1 and IDH2 in glioma of rat has not been reported as yet. The protein encoding sequences of IDH1 (1245 bp) and IDH2 (1359 bp) are sequenced in the present study. However, the mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 are not detected in this kind of gliomas. IDH1 mutations are regarded as early events in the development of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas in human brain. Tumors without mutations of IDH1 were often found to have mutations at the analogous position R172 of the closely related IDH2 gene [5], which suggested that mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 played an important role in the evolutionary, stepwise development of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas [23]. We now report that mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 are not detected in the rat C6 glioma cells in the present study, which suggests that these mutations are not required for the development of glioblastoma induced by N,N′-nitroso-methylurea.  3.2. Assay of transfection efficiency  Mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 are not detected in the C6 cells, therefore, we perform artificially site-directed mutagenesis of IDH2 ( Fig. 1B). Then, pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-N1-IDH2 and pEGFP-N1-IDH2R172G are transfected into C6 cells and the transfection efficiency and the expression levels of EGFP are observed (Fig. 2). EGFP is excited at 488 nm with an argon laser and fluorescence is detected at 500–540 nm. As shown in Fig. 2, the transfection efficiency of each group reaches similar levels (∼80%) at 24 h. Also, the high expression levels of EGFP, IDH2–EGFP and IDH2R172G–EGFP present in the cells at the same time, which clearly illustrates that the transfection reagents and method used give the highest level of transfection result. Generally, cells are typically harvested 24–48 h post-transfection for studies designed to analyze transient expression of transfected genes. In the present study, expressions of EGFP, IDH2-EGFP and IDH2R172G–EGFP in the context of pEGFP-N1 vector can be detected in a time frame from 12 to 48 h. However, the expression level of IDH2R172G–EGFP is higher than that of IDH2–EGFP at 48 h, which demonstrates that the half-life of IDH2R172G is longer than that of IDH2.  Photograph of the transfected cells sample obtained with a laser scanning ... Fig. 2.  Photograph of the transfected cells sample obtained with a laser scanning confocal microscope. C6 cells are transfected with 400 ng of pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-N1-IDH2 and pEGFP-N1-IDH2R172G using 1 μL Lipofactamine 2000TM reagent in the absence of serum. All transfections are performed in 96-well plates. EGFP is excited at 488 nm with an argon laser and fluorescence is detected at 500–540 nm. The differential interference contrast (DIC) confocal imagings are also present to record the growth status of cells at 48 h post-tansfection. Scale bar: 200 μm. Figure options 3.3. IDH2R172G improves the growth of C6 cells  The result that mutant IDH1 elevated the stabilization of HIF-1α, which regulated the expression of genes implicated in tumor growth and improved the tumor growth, was reported [14] ;  [24] (Fig. 3A). In the present study, MTT assay is performed to determine the effect of IDH2R172G on tumor growth (Fig. 3B).  (A) The link between mutant IDHM, HIF-1 α and NADPH [23]. Metabolic enzyme IDH ... Fig. 3.  (A) The link between mutant IDHM, HIF-1 α and NADPH [23]. Metabolic enzyme IDH altered mutationally and then affected glioma development by stimulating HIF-1α pathway and tumor angiogenesis. (B) Effects of IDH2 and IDH2R172G on C6 glioma cells proliferation. Proliferation assay is performed by MTT test as described in the text. The inhibition rates of each group at 12, 24, 36, 48 h post-transfection are calculated by recording the absorbance at 490 nm. Shown are mean values of triplicate assays ± SD. (C) IDH2 activity assay. The production level of NADPH is down-regulated by the exogenous expression of IDH2R172G. Figure options Cells exhibit the stress response to the cytotoxicity of transfection reagents and the heterogenous proteins – EGFP and IDH2Wild or Mutant–EGFP, which results in the high inhibition rates during the 12 h post-transfection. Then, cells adapt well to this status gradually, such as the phenomenon detected at 24 h. With the continuous expression of heterogenous proteins, there are changes for the inhibition rate of each group. The inhibition rate of pEGFP-N1-IDH2R172G group is lower than that of pEGFP-N1 group and pEGFP-N1-IDH2 group, which is predominant at 36 and 48 h. The assay indicates that mutant IDH2 promotes the growth of the rat C6 gliomas.  The link between IDH, α-KG and HIF-1α highlighted an emerging theme in which mutationally altered metabolic enzymes were thought to contribute to tumor growth by stimulating HIF-1α pathway and tumor angiogenesis. However, both of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations diminished the enzyme activation [5]. The phenomenon that mutant IDH2 improves the growth of the rat C6 gliomas may be attributed to mutant IDH2 increases HIF-1α level.  3.4. IDH2R172G mutation diminishes IDH2 activity  We assess the effect of IDH2R172G mutation on IDH2 activity by determining IDH2-mediated NADPH production in vitro. Fig. 3C shows that exogenous expression of wild-type IDH2 significantly increases the production of NADPH, whereas exogenous expression of IDH2R172G reduces the generation of NADPH, which denotes that IDH2R172G mutation diminishes IDH2 activity.  3.5. IDH2R172G increases sensitivity of C6 cells to chemotherapy  IDH2 mutations reduced not only the α-KG level but also the generation of NADPH [5]. Low level of cytoplasmic NADPH, which resulted in impairing reduction of glutathione (GSH) and affected the thioredoxin system, might sensitize glioblastoma to irradiation and chemotherapy. To test this hypothesis, five antitumor drugs (adriamycin, cytarabine, teniposide, nimustine and dactinomycin D) are selected to detect these sensitivity changes by the MTT method (Fig. 4A and E). The IC50s of adriamycin, cytarabine, teniposide, nimustine and dactinomycin D on C6 cells are 0.82 μg/mL, 0.65 μg/mL, 0.25 μg/mL, 23.12 μg/mL and 0.004 μg/mL, respectively. Interestingly, we find that the inhibition rate of pEGFP-N1-IDH2 group is higher than that of pEGFP-N1 group and pEGFP-N1-IDH2R172G group and the inhibition rates of pEGFP-N1 group and pEGFP-N1-IDH2R172G group have no significant difference, which is ubiquitous among the five drugs at any dosage (Fig. 4F and J). We speculate that the expression of heterogenous protein IDH2Wild–EGFP elevates the levels of α-KG, decreases the stabilization of HIF-1α, and inhibits the growth of C6 cells finally. The effects of heterogenous proteins IDH2Mutant–EGFP expression on C6 cells proliferation are divided into two aspects: (i) it reduces the generation of NADPH, which impairs reduction of glutathione (GSH) and affects the thioredoxin system, may sensitize C6 cells to chemotherapy; (ii) it decreases the level of α-KG, elevates the stabilization of HIF-1α, and improves the growth of C6 cells. Therefore, we conjecture that the paradoxical effects finally result in the fact that the inhibition rate between pEGFP-N1 group and pEGFP-N1-IDH2R172G group has no significant difference.  IDH2R172G increases sensitivity of C6 cells to chemotherapy. The sensitivity ... Fig. 4.  IDH2R172G increases sensitivity of C6 cells to chemotherapy. The sensitivity test of C6 cells to broad spectrum antitumor and specific anti-glioma drugs is performed by MTT assay. Adriamycin, cytarabine, teniposide, nimustine and dactinomycin (A–E) display prominent inhibition to C6 cells, which are all dependent on the concentration. C6 cells tansfected with pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-N1-IDH2, pEGFP-N1-IDH2R172G exhibit different sensitivity to these drugs (F–J). Shown are mean values of triplicate assays ± SD. Figure options The phenomenon that patients harboring IDH1/IDH2 mutations usually had better outcomes than those with the wild-type IDH genes was reported [5]. Recently, one study hypothesized that the IDH mutations were not the origin of gliomas but a subsequent protective mechanism that interfered with the metabolism of the tumor cells, making these cells fragile and susceptible to cell death. This process finally made patients bearing such IDH mutations to survive [25]. IDH2 appears to function as a tumor suppressor that, when mutationally inactivated, contributes to tumorigenesis. However, IDH2 mutations in glioma lead to enhanced sensitivity level to chemotherapy. The IDH2R172G mutation in glioma can give a benefit to traditional chemotherapy of this cancer.  The somatic mutations in cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) observed in gliomas can lead to the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Here, we report that tumor 2HG is elevated in a high percentage of patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Surprisingly, less than half of cases with elevated 2HG possessed IDH1 mutations. The remaining cases with elevated 2HG had mutations in IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. These data demonstrate that a shared feature of all cancer-associated IDH mutations is production of the onco-metabolite 2HG. Furthermore, AML patients with IDH mutations display a significantly reduced number of other well characterized AML-associated mutations and/or associated chromosomal abnormalities, potentially implicating IDH mutation in a distinct mechanism of AML pathogenesis.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Mutations in human cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase I (IDH1) occur somatically in >70% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas, and in 8.5% of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) (Mardis et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Mutations have also been reported in cancers of the colon and prostate (Kang et al., 2009; Sjoblom et al., 2006). To date, all reported IDH1 mutations result in an amino acid substitution at a single arginine residue in the enzyme’s active site, R132. A subset of intermediate grade gliomas lacking mutations in IDH1 have been found to harbor mutations in IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. The IDH2 mutations which have been identified in gliomas occur at the analogous residue to IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172. Both IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutants lack the wild-type enzyme’s ability to convert isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (Yan et al., 2009). To date, all reported IDH1 or IDH2 mutations are heterozygous, with the cancer cells retaining one wild-type copy of the relevant IDH1 or IDH2 allele. No patient has been reported with both an IDH1 and IDH2 mutation. These data argue against the IDH mutations resulting in a simple loss of function.  Normally both cytosolic IDH1 and mitochondrial IDH2 exist as homodimers within their respective cellular compartments, and the mutant proteins retain the ability to bind to their respective wild-type partner. Therefore, it has been proposed that mutant IDH1 can act as a dominant negative against wild-type IDH1 function, resulting in a decrease in cytosolic α-ketoglutarate levels and leading to an indirect activation of the HIF-1α pathway (Zhao et al., 2009). However, recent work has provided an alternative explanation. The R132H IDH1 mutation observed in gliomas was found to display a gain of function for the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) (Dang et al., 2009). This in vitro activity was confirmed when 2HG was found to be elevated in IDH1-mutated gliomas. Whether this neomorphic activity is a common feature shared by IDH2 mutations was not determined.  IDH1 R132 mutations identical to those reported to produce 2HG in gliomas were recently reported in AML (Mardis et al., 2009). These IDH1 R132 mutations were observed in 8.5% of AML patients studied, and a significantly higher percentage of mutation was observed in the subset of patients whose tumors lacked cytogenetic abnormalities. IDH2 R172 mutations were not observed in this study. However, during efforts to confirm and extend these findings, we found an IDH2 R172K mutation in an AML sample obtained from a 77 year old female. This finding confirmed that both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations can occur in AML and prompted us to more comprehensively investigate the role of IDH2 in AML.  The present study was undertaken to see if IDH2 mutations might share the same neomorphic activity as recently reported for glioma-associated IDH1 R132 mutations. We also determined whether tumor-associated 2HG elevation could prospectively identify AML patients with mutations in IDH. To investigate the lack of reduction to homozygosity for either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations in tumor samples, the ability of wild-type IDH1 and/or IDH2 to contribute to cell proliferation was examined.  Go to: RESULTS IDH2 is mutated in AML  A recent study employing a whole-genome sequencing strategy in an AML patient resulted in the identification of somatic IDH1 mutations in AML (Mardis et al., 2009). Based on the report that IDH2 mutations were also observed in the other major tumor type in which IDH1 mutations were implicated (Yan et al., 2009), we sequenced the IDH2 gene in a set of de-identified AML DNA samples. Several cases with IDH2 R172 mutations were identified. In the initial case, the IDH2 mutation found, R172K, was the same mutation reported in glioma samples. It has been recently reported that cancer-associated IDH1 R132 mutants display a loss-of-function for the use of isocitrate as substrate, with a concomitant gain-of-function for the reduction of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). This prompted us to determine if the recurrent R172K mutation in IDH2 observed in both gliomas and leukemias might also display the same neomorphic activity. In IDH1, the role of R132 in determining IDH1 enzymatic activity is consistent with the stabilizing charge interaction of its guanidinium moiety with the β-carboxyl group of isocitrate (Figure 1A). This β-carboxyl is critical for IDH’s ability to catalyze the interconversion of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate, with the overall reaction occurring in two steps through a β-carboxyl-containing intermediate (Ehrlich and Colman, 1976). Proceeding in the oxidative direction, this β-carboxyl remains on the substrate throughout the IDH reaction until the final decarboxylating step which produces α-ketoglutarate.  Figure 1 Figure 1 IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 are analogous residues that both interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 are analogous residues that both interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate  To understand how R172 mutations in IDH2 might relate to the R132 mutations in IDH1 characterized for gliomas, we modeled human IDH2 based on the pig IDH2 structure containing bound isocitrate (Ceccarelli et al., 2002). Human and pig IDH2 protein share over 97% identity and all active site residues are identical. The active site of human IDH2 was structurally aligned with human IDH1 (Figure 1). Similar to IDH1, in the active site of IDH2 the isocitrate substrate is stabilized by multiple charge interactions throughout the binding pocket. Moreover, like R132 in IDH1, the analogous R172 in IDH2 is predicted to interact strongly with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate. This raised the possibility that cancer-associated IDH2 mutations at R172 might affect enzymatic interconversion of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate similarly to IDH1 mutations at R132.  Mutation of IDH2 R172K enhances α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption  To test whether cancer-associated IDH2 R172K mutations shared the gain of function in α-ketoglutarate reduction observed for IDH1 R132 mutations (Dang et al., 2009), we overexpressed wild-type or R172K mutant IDH2 in cells with endogenous wild-type IDH2 expression, and then assessed isocitrate-dependent NADPH production and α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates. As reported previously (Yan et al., 2009), extracts from cells expressing the R172K mutant IDH2 did not display isocitrate-dependent NADPH production above the levels observed in extracts from vector-transfected cells. In contrast, extracts from cells expressing a comparable amount of wild-type IDH2 markedly increased isocitrate-dependent NADPH production (Figure 2A). However, when these same extracts were tested for NADPH consumption in the presence of α-ketoglutarate, R172K mutant IDH2 expression was found to correlate with a significant enhancement to α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption. Vector-transfected cell lysates did not demonstrate this activity (Figure 2B). Although not nearly to the same degree as with the mutant enzyme, wild-type IDH2 overexpression also reproducibly enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption under these conditions.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Expression of R172K mutant IDH2 results in enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent consumption of NADPH Mutation of IDH2 R172K results in elevated 2HG levels  R172K mutant IDH2 lacks the guanidinium moiety in residue 172 that normally stabilizes β-carboxyl addition in the interconversion of α-ketoglutarate and isocitrate. Yet R172K mutant IDH2 exhibited enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates (Figure 2B). A similar enhancement of α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption has been reported for R132 mutations in IDH1, resulting in conversion of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). To determine if cells expressing IDH2 R172K shared this property, we expressed IDH2 wild-type or IDH2 R172K in cells. The accumulation of organic acids, including 2HG, both within cells and in culture medium of the transfectants was then assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after MTBSTFA derivatization of the organic acid pool. We observed a metabolite peak eluting at 32.5 min on GC-MS which was of minimal intensity in the culture medium of IDH2 wild-type expressing cells, but which in the medium of IDH2 R172K expressing cells had a markedly higher intensity approximating that of the glutamate signal (Figures 3A–3B). Mass spectra of this metabolite peak fit that predicted for MTBSTFA-derivatized 2HG, and the peak’s identity as 2HG was additionally confirmed by matching its mass spectra with that obtained by derivatization of commercial 2HG standards (Figure 3C). Similar results were obtained when the intracellular organic acid pool was analyzed. IDH2 R172K expressing cells were found to have an approximately 100-fold increase in the intracellular levels of 2HG compared with the levels detected in vector-transfected and IDH2 wild-type overexpressing cells (Figure 3D). Consistent with previous work, IDH1 R132H expressing cells analyzed in the same experiment had comparable accumulation of 2HG in both cells and in culture medium. 2HG accumulation was not observed in cells overexpressing IDH1 wild-type (data not shown).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Expression of R172K mutant IDH2 elevates 2HG levels within cells and in culture medium Mutant IDH2 produces the (R) enantiomer of 2HG  Cancer-associated mutants of IDH1 produce the (R) enantiomer of 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). To determine the chirality of the 2HG produced by mutant IDH2 and to compare it with that produced by R132H mutant IDH1, we used a two step derivatization method to distinguish the stereoisomers of 2HG by GC-MS: an esterification step with R-(-)-2-butanolic HCl, followed by acetylation of the 2-hydroxyl with acetic anhydride (Kamerling et al., 1981). Test of this method on commercial S(+)-2HG and R(-)-2HG standards demonstrated clear separation of the (S) and (R) enantiomers, and mass spectra of the metabolite peaks confirmed their identity as the O-acetylated di-(-)-2-butyl esters of 2HG (Figure S1A and S1B). By this method, we confirmed the chirality of the 2HG found in cells expressing either R132H mutant IDH1 or R172K mutant IDH2 corresponded exclusively to the (R) enantiomer (Figure S1C and S1D).  Leukemic cells bearing heterozygous R172K IDH2 mutations accumulate 2HG  To determine whether 2HG also accumulates in leukemic cells with either IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutations, we next analyzed the 2HG levels of selected leukemic samples. To date, every IDH1 R132H or IDH2 R172K mutant AML sample has exhibited evidence of 2HG accumulation, demonstrating a 2HG signal intensity by GC-MS analysis that is ≥ 30% of the intrasample glutamate signal. In contrast, control extracts have either had undetectable 2HG or a 2HG signal ≤ 1% of that for glutamate (n=13, p<0.001). Thus leukemic cells bearing either IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutation share the ability to accumulate 2HG in vivo with glioma cells exhibiting IDH1 R132 mutations.  IDH2 is critical for proliferating cells and contributes to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate in the mitochondria  A peculiar feature of the IDH-mutated cancers described to date is their lack of reduction to homozygosity. All tumors with IDH mutations retain one IDH wild-type allele. To address this issue we examined whether wild-type IDH1 and/or IDH2 might play a role in either cell survival or proliferation. Consistent with this possibility, we found that siRNA knockdown of either IDH1 or IDH2 can significantly reduce the proliferative capacity of a cancer cell line expressing both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 (Figure 4A).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Both IDH1 and IDH2 are critical for cell proliferation IDH1 is one of only three cytosolic enzymes that contribute to the NADPH production required for nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis during cell growth (DeBerardinis et al., 2007). In addition, IDH1 contributes to the maintenance of cytosolic redox state (Yan et al., 2009). Therefore, there are several reasons why IDH1 might be important for cell proliferation. However, unlike IDH1, IDH2 resides in the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria normally contain a high level of NADPH and readily interconvert NADH and NADPH (Rydstrom, 2006). Furthermore, it is IDH3, the NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, that is believed to be responsible for isocitrate conversion into α-ketoglutarate in the mitochondrial citric acid cycle (McCormack and Denton, 1979). This raised the possibility that wild-type IDH2 might be contributing to the ability of cancer cells to produce citrate from glutamine, as illustrated in Figure 4B. Such an enzymatic activity, though not ascribed to a particular IDH isoform, was characterized in early metabolic studies (Ochoa, 1948; Siebert et al., 1957). As shown in Figure 2B, when wild-type IDH2 was over-expressed in cells, it was found to consume NADPH in an α-ketoglutarate-dependent manner.  To test the possibility that wild-type IDH2 contributes to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate in the mitochondria of proliferating cells, we labeled cells with [13C-U]-L-glutamine (glutamine +5), and subsequently measured isotopic enrichment in citrate by GC-MS. Enrichment of citrate with five 13C atoms (citrate +5) can arise from the reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate +5 to isocitrate +5, while citrate enriched with four 13C atoms (citrate +4) can arise from oxidative metabolism of α-ketoglutarate through the traditional citric acid cycle (Figure 4B). Both forms of citrate production were reproducibly observed. To examine the role of IDH2 in citrate production, cells were treated with one of two independent IDH2 siRNAs. IDH2 siRNA treated cells displayed a significant reduction in levels of citrate +5, supporting a role for mitochondrial IDH2 in reductive carboxylation. Of note, no change in citrate +4 levels was observed, indicating that the effect of IDH2 knockdown was specific and not affecting other fundamental processes regulating the citric acid cycle (Figure 4C). Similar labeling patterns were observed in aconitate, an intermediate in the isomerization of isocitrate to citrate, with aconitate +5 also reduced following IDH2 knockdown, and aconitate +4 levels remaining unchanged (data not shown). In contrast, when cells were treated with one of two independent siRNAs against IDH3, there was a reproducible increase in citrate +5, while citrate +4 was unchanged (Figure 4D). These data support a role for IDH2 and not IDH3 in the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate by reductive carboxylation in the mitochondria, and provide a possible explanation for the lack of reduction to homozygosity for IDH2 mutations in cancer.  2HG can be used as a screening test for neomorphic IDH mutants  The above data suggest that the common feature of the IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutants is an ability to produce 2HG that can be measured directly in tumor samples. This suggested that screening for the presence of 2HG in tumor samples could be used as an assay to detect IDH mutations. To test this hypothesis, we obtained frozen samples of AML cells from 18 patients aged 50 years or older who presented with normal karyotype AML. All 18 samples were first screened for the intensity of their 2HG signal on GC-MS as a percentage of the intrasample glutamate signal (Table 1 and Figure 5). GC-MS analysis demonstrated that 9 of 18 samples had elevated 2HG. This fraction of samples was much higher than expected from the reported incidence of IDH1 mutation (Mardis et al., 2009). To correlate the results with mutation status, IDH1 and IDH2 were sequenced for all 18 samples in a blinded fashion. All samples displaying a signal ratio for 2HG/glutamate > 1% had either an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation. In contrast, none of the samples with a 2HG/glutamate signal ratio ≤ 1% had an IDH mutation (Table 1). Thus in this sample set, 2HG measurement was predictive of IDH mutation status.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Primary human AML samples with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations display marked elevations of 2HG Table 1 Table 1 Patient characteristics, metabolite analysis, and IDH status. The genetic analysis of these tumor samples revealed two neomorphic IDH mutations that produce 2HG. Among the IDH1 mutations, tumors with IDH1 R132C or IDH1 R132G accumulated 2HG. This result is not unexpected, as a number of mutations of R132 to other residues have also been shown to accumulate 2HG in glioma samples (Dang et al., 2009).  The other neomorphic allele was unexpected. All five of the IDH2 mutations producing 2HG in this sample set contained the same mutation, R140Q. As shown in Figure 1, both R140 in IDH2 and R100 in IDH1 are predicted to interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate. Additional modeling revealed that despite the reduced ability to bind isocitrate, the R140Q mutant IDH2 is predicted to maintain its ability to bind and orient α-ketoglutarate in the active site (Figure 6). This potentially explains the ability of cells with this neomorph to accumulate 2HG in vivo. As shown in Figure 5, samples containing IDH2 R140Q mutations were found to have accumulated 2HG to levels 10–100 fold greater than the highest levels detected in IDH wild-type samples.  Figure 6 Figure 6 Structural modeling of R140Q mutant IDH2 IDH2 mutations are more common than IDH1 mutations in AML  In the above sample set, just over half of the AML samples with 2HG accumulation had IDH2 mutations. This is in contrast to the data reported for gliomas in which less than 5% of IDH mutations were in IDH2 (Hartmann et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Initial studies of IDH genes in leukemia had failed to detect IDH2 mutations in R172 (Mardis et al., 2009). In the 18 cases we examined initially, all of the IDH2 mutations were IDH2 R140Q. However, this sample may have been biased by either the sample size and/or patient selection. We therefore analyzed 78 serial AML samples collected from a single center to determine the frequency of IDH1/2 mutation and investigated the co-association of IDH1/2 mutations with other genes known to contribute to AML pathogenesis (Table 2). While IDH1 mutations were found in 7.7% of samples in this analysis (6/78), twice as many mutations were detected in IDH2, at a frequency of 15.4% (12/78, p<0.05). Both the R140Q and R172K neomorphic alleles of IDH2 were identified. Of note, the IDH2 R140Q mutation was observed in more patients (7/78) than the R172K allele of IDH2 or R132 mutations in IDH1. None of the IDH2-mutated samples were found to also have somatic mutations in Flt-3, NPM1, or ASXL1. Furthermore, IDH2 and IDH1 mutations were only observed in normal karyotype AML patients, whereas known cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in 7/51 samples without IDH1/2 mutations (13.7%; all IDH mutants vs. IDH wild-type, p<0.05). We also examined whether IDH1 and/or IDH2 mutation status had any effect on the overall survival of this set of patients. As was previously reported (Mardis et al., 2009), mutations in IDH1 did not appear to affect overall survival (p=0.37, Figure S2A). However, we noted a trend towards improved survival in patients who presented with IDH2 mutations (p=0.08, Figure S2B).  Table 2 Table 2 Clinical and genetic parameters of IDH1/2 wild-type and mutant AML samples. Go to: DISCUSSION Neomorphic enzymatic activity to produce 2HG is the shared feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations  Mutations in the cytosolic enzyme IDH1 have been reported in a high percentage of gliomas and a significant subset of AML patients (Mardis et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Recently, IDH1 mutations of R132 were associated with the accumulation of the metabolite 2HG in glial tumor samples (Dang et al., 2009). The discovery of an elderly AML patient with an IDH2 R172 mutation, the analogous residue to IDH1 R132, prompted us to test whether this IDH2 mutation also resulted in a gain-of-function ability to catalyze the conversion of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG. In this study of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in AML, we have demonstrated that 2HG production is a common feature of the spontaneous mutations in these two IDH homologs. By showing that 2HG production can result from mutation at any of three residues which normally stabilize the β-carboxyl of isocitrate, IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172, and IDH2 R140, we demonstrate that it is the truncated, non-carboxylating, reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate that is the common feature linking all cancer-associated IDH mutations.  2HG as a screening and diagnostic marker  With our demonstration that 2HG production is the common feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, the measurement of 2HG levels allowed us to identify additional IDH mutations in AML patients. This is exemplified in this study by the use of 2HG screening to identify two distinct mutations in IDH2, R140Q and R172K, that produce 2HG. These data demonstrate that at least IDH2 neomorphic mutations are not limited to a single arginine residue. Therefore, additional IDH1 and IDH2 neomorphic alleles may still remain to be found in gliomas, hematopoietic malignancies, and in other cancers. The 2HG levels in cancers with IDH mutations are consistently 10–100 fold elevated over levels found in samples lacking mutations of IDH1 or IDH2. Inborn errors of metabolism which lead to 2HG elevation are exceptionally rare and have devastating developmental consequences (Kolker et al., 2002a). Tumors displaying elevated 2HG are unlikely to be false positives. Thus, 2HG appears to be an important marker of IDH1/2-mutated neoplasms. Given the quantities of 2HG that accumulate in the culture medium of cells expressing IDH mutant enzymes, 2HG may even be detectable in the peripheral blood of leukemia patients with IDH mutations at the time of presentation. We are currently testing the potential of such a screening and diagnostic approach.  Maintaining at least one IDH1 and IDH2 wild-type allele may be essential for transformed cells  2HG production is a shared feature of heterozygous mutations in either cytosolic IDH1 or mitochondrial IDH2. There is a marked difference in the enzymatic rate of isocitrate-dependent NADPH production by the wild-type proteins and α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption by both IDH1 and IDH2 mutants (Figure 2 and Dang et al., 2009). Nevertheless, both mutant proteins lead to an over 100-fold increase in tumor 2HG accumulation. In addition, it appears that both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 can play positive and non-redundant roles in cell proliferation. The roles of IDH1 and IDH2 in supporting cell proliferation are likely to be different. IDH1 contributes to cytosolic NADPH production. In the case of IDH1 mutant proteins, it has been reported that a local supply of NADPH and α-ketoglutarate is required to drive 2HG production (Dang et al., 2009). In the context of a wild-type/mutant IDH1 heterodimer, the required substrates for the mutant’s neomorphic activity are most readily provided by the wild-type subunit’s normal activity on NADP+ and isocitrate. However, for the neomorphic activity of mitochondrial IDH2 mutants, the requirement for local generation of substrate is unlikely to be absolute. Mitochondria typically have a high NADPH/NADP+ ratio, supported in part by the ability to interconvert NADPH and NADH in the matrix (Rydstrom, 2006). In addition, mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate is maintained at high levels by a variety of anaplerotic substrates. While the exact role of wild-type IDH2 in supporting cell growth will require further investigation, this requirement correlates with the ability of IDH2 to contribute to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate via a pathway of reductive carboxylation in the mitochondria of proliferating cells.  2HG as an onco-metabolite  Although 2HG has been proposed to increase ROS levels in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism (Kolker et al., 2002b; Latini et al., 2003), to date we have no evidence that the metabolite acts as a mutagen. This is consistent with data presented here that IDH1-mutated and IDH2-mutated AML samples typically do not harbor other known mutations associated with AML, as well as a prior report that IDH-mutated gliomas often lack other mutations that are commonly acquired early in glioma pathogenesis (Yan et al., 2009). In an AML case with an IDH1 mutation that was sequenced in its entirety (Mardis et al., 2009), there were a relatively small total number of somatic, non-synonymous mutations. However, a possibility by which 2HG might contribute to tumorigenesis emerges from consideration of the tumor subtypes in which IDH mutations are found with high frequency: gliomas with mixed astrocytic and oligodendroglial features, and acute myeloid leukemias. In both cases, proliferation of a relatively undifferentiated cell population is central to the disease, and pathogenesis is marked by a block to differentiation rather than simply by an increase in proliferative rate. Thus, one may speculate that 2HG’s effect in the tumor and its microenvironment is to block cellular differentiation. Whether cells carrying a mutant IDH transgene exhibit a block to differentiation in vivo will need to be examined. The production of lineage-specific mutant IDH transgenic animals or hematopoetic bone marrow reconstitution following retroviral introduction of a mutant IDH will allow future studies to test this hypothesis.  Whether 2HG fits into the broad class of mutagens or plays a distinct role in carcinogenesis remains to be determined. For now, it appears to represent a highly correlative maker for an emerging class of somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes. Importantly, these mutations appear to define a significant subset of CNS tumors and leukemias. The identification of frequent IDH2 mutations in AML increases the significance of this family of mutations in understanding the pathogenesis of AML. Taken together, IDH mutations occur in 23% of samples analyzed here. All IDH mutations reported to date share the neomorphic ability to produce high levels of tumor 2HG. Future studies are required to understand the role of 2HG in leukemic transformation and to elucidate the role of IDH1/IDH2 in the pathogenesis of AML.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Patient selection and statistical analysis  Patient samples were obtained from either the Stem Cell and Xenotransplantation Core Facility of the University of Pennsylvania or from the tissue collections of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute. Approval was obtained from the institutional review boards at the University of Pennsylvania (IRB protocol 703185) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute (IRB protocols 95–091 and 06–107), and informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All samples were collected after de-identification for these studies. For assessing clinical and genetic parameters of IDH1/2 wild-type and mutant AML, 78 serial samples from AML patients referred for molecular testing at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were examined. For 2HG assays, patient samples were obtained from the Stem Cell and Xenotransplantation Core Facility of the University of Pennsylvania. The initial 18 samples were selected from de-identified AML patients aged 50 years or older at diagnosis with lesions determined to have normal cytogenetic status. Cells used for these assays were prepared by Ficoll separation of mononuclear cells (MNCs) from peripheral blood or bone marrow. MNCs were frozen as viable cells in 10% DMSO. Student’s t test and Chi-square analysis were used to analyze data. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.  Sequence Analysis of IDH1 and IDH2  Genomic DNA was extracted from bone marrow mononuclear cells or from sorted leukemic cells; for samples with less than 70% blasts flow cytometric sorting (FACSAria) was used to isolate blast cells according to leukemic blast immunophenotype before DNA isolation. High-throughput DNA sequence analysis was used to screen for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. All DNA samples were whole genome amplified using Ø29 polymerase and mutations were validated on unamplified DNA to ensure all mutations were present in the diagnostic sample. Sequencing of IDH1 used primers which cover amino acid residues 41–138 (sense, 5’-TGTGTTGAGATGGACGCCTA-3’; antisense, 5’-GGTGTACTCAGAGCCTTCGC-3’). Sequencing of IDH2 used primers which cover amino acid residues 125–226 (sense, 5’-CTGCCTCTTTGTGGCCTAAG-3’; antisense, 5’-ATTCTGGTTGAAAGATGGCG-3’). Sequence analysis was performed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College PA) and all mutations were validated by repeat PCR and sequencing on unamplified DNA from the archival sample.  Structural modeling  Human IDH2 has 97% homology with pig IDH2, and none of the 13 residues that are different (out of 418 total, excluding the N-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence) are found in the active site. A PDB structure of pig IDH2 is available, with isocitrate in the active site (1LWD) (Ceccarelli et al., 2002). Based on the highly homologous pig structure, conservative structural models of human IDH2 were built with the CHARMM molecular mechanics package using the CHARMM27 force field. To model wild-type IDH2 with isocitrate, the 13 residues of 1LWD differing between pig and human were first changed to the human sequence. The side chains were then rebuilt, hydrogen atoms added to all residues, the substrate, active site Mn2+ ions, and conserved residues were restrained, and the structure minimized allowing only the changed residues to relax. For the α-ketoglutarate complexes, the substrate conformation/pose was first modeled on isocitrate by removing the β-carboxyl group and replacing it with a hydrogen. The wild-type IDH2-α-ketoglutarate complex was then minimized allowing only the active site residues (as defined in entry 1LWD) and substrate to relax. The R140Q mutant IDH2-α-ketoglutarate complex was subsequently modeled by changing arginine 140 to glutamine, and rebuilding the side chain. The structure was then minimized in two stages. First the mutated residue was allowed to relax, followed by a second relaxation of the active site residues, Mn2+, and substrate. All modeling images were generated using PyMOL Viewer (DeLano, 2002).  Constructing IDH1 and IDH2 mutants  The cDNA clone of human IDH2 (BC009244) was purchased from Invitrogen in pOTB7. Human IDH1 (BC012846.1) was purchased from ATCC in pCMV-Sport6. Standard site-directed mutagenesis techniques were used to generate IDH2 R172K by introducing a g515a change in the IDH2 open reading frame (ORF). IDH1 R132H was made by introducing a g395a base pair change in the IDH1 ORF. Wild-type and mutant sequences were then subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and confirmed by direct sequencing before expression in mammalian cells.  Cell culture, transfection, and metabolic labeling  293T cells and Bcl-xL-transfected SF188 cells (SF188) were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (CellGro). For expression of wild-type and mutant IDH1 and IDH2, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For IDH siRNA experiments, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMax, with oligonucleotides obtained from Sigma-Proligo. For metabolic labeling experiments, cells were cultured in glutamine-free DMEM supplemented with 4 mM [13C-U]-L-glutamine (Cambridge Isotope) for the 3h prior to metabolite extraction.  Cell lysate based enzyme assays  For IDH2 enzymatic assays, cells were lysed 48 h following transfection, using mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma). Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000g at 4 °C. Supernatants were then collected and normalized for total protein concentration. To measure IDH oxidative activity, 0.3 µg of lysate protein was added to 200 µl of an assay solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1.3 mM MnCl2, 0.33 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM β-NADP+, and 0.1 mM D-(+)-threo-isocitrate. The increase in 340 nm absorbance (OD340) as a measure of NADPH production was measured every 20 s for 30 min on a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Data are plotted as the mean activity of 3 replicates per lysate averaged among 5 time points centered at every 5 minutes. To measure IDH reductive activity, 3 µg of lysate protein was added to 200 µl of an assay solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.3 mM MnCl2, 0.01 mM β-NADPH, and 0.5 mM α-ketoglutarate. NADPH consumption was measured as the decrease in OD340, with 3 replicates per lysate. For all experiments, OD340 changes in assay buffer lacking lysate protein were measured and subsequently subtracted from the OD340 changes measured in lysate replicates to arrive at final values.  Western blot  To measure IDH2 levels in cell lysates used for enzymatic assays, aliquots of the same lysates used in activity measurements were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with IDH2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam, ab55271), and then detected with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare, NA931V). For assessing IDH knockdown in siRNA experiments, cells treated in parallel with those used for labeling or proliferative studies were lysed 48 h following transfection in standard RIPA buffer (1% NaDOC, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01 M Tris pH 8.0, 0.14 M NaCl), and then probed with IDH2 antibody as above, IDH1 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc49996), or IDH3A rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, ab58641). Actin antibody (Santa Cruz, sc1616) was also used to assess equal protein loading of Western blots.  Metabolite extraction  Cellular organic acids were extracted as previously described (Bennett et al., 2008). Briefly, after gentle removal of culture medium from proliferating cells, or freezing medium from frozen viable AML samples, cells were rapidly quenched with 80% methanol, chilled to −80°C, and then incubated at −80°C for 15 min. Extracts were subsequently transferred and centrifuged at 14,000g for 20 min. at 4°C. The organic acid pool in the supernatant was further purified by drying under nitrogen gas, redissolving in deionized water, and then elution from an AG-1 ×8 100–200 anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad) in 3 N HCl after washing with five column volumes. For media analysis, culture medium from transfected cells 24–48 h following transfection was collected and diluted five-fold with methanol. After centrifugation at 14,000g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated protein, supernatants were dried under nitrogen gas, and organic acids were purified as described above.  Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis  After drying the HCl eluate, samples were redissolved in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA; Regis) and heated for 1 h at 60°C to derivatize prior to GC-MS analysis. Samples were injected into an Agilent 7890A GC with an HP-5MS capillary column, connected to an Agilent 5975C Mass selective detector operating in splitless mode using electron impact ionization with ionizing voltage of −70 eV and electron multiplier set to 1060 V. GC temperature was started at 100 °C for 3 min, ramped to 230 °C at 4 °C/min and held for 4 min, then ramped to 300 °C and held for 5 min. Mass range of 50–500 amu was recorded at 2.71 scans/sec. Isotopic enrichment in citric acid was monitored using ions at m/e− 463 and 464 for citrate +4 and citrate +5 (containing 4 and 5 13C-enriched atoms, respectively), formed through loss of a t-butyl (−57 amu) and t-butyldimethylsilanol (−132 amu) from the molecular ion tetra-TBDMS-citric acid (648 amu). Isotopomer distributions were simultaneously corrected for naturally occurring heavy isotopes of all elements in each mass fragment using a correction matrix as previously described (Weckwerth, 2007). Identification of the 2HG metabolite peak was confirmed using standards obtained from Sigma. 2HG and glutamate signal intensities were quantified by integration of peak areas.  Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)  Organic acids from cellular extracts were purified as described above, followed by evaporation to dryness under nitrogen. After redissolving samples in deionized water, citrate was detected on two different LC-MS approaches, both of which gave comparable results. In both cases, LC separation was by reversed phase chromatography using tributylamine as an ion pairing agent (Lu et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2007) with ionization by negative electrospray at 23 kV. The first MS approach used a Thermo Discovery Max triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode, with citrate quantified using the reaction 191 → 87 at 20 eV. Additional reactions for every possible labeled form of citrate were also monitored using variations of the same transition. Reactions used to monitor other TCA components have been described previously (Bajad et al., 2006). The second MS approach used a Thermo Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer operated at 100,000 mass resolving power, with citrate and its isotope-labeled forms quantified based on extracted ion chromatograms at their exact masses.  SIGNIFICANCE  Most cancer-associated enzyme mutations result in either catalytic inactivation or constitutive activation. Here we report that the common feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations observed in AML and glioma is the acquisition of an enzymatic activity not shared by either wild-type enzyme. The product of this neomorphic enzyme activity can be readily detected in tumor samples and we show that tumor metabolite analysis can identify patients with tumor-associated IDH mutations. Using this method, we discovered a 2HG-producing IDH2 mutation, IDH2 R140Q, that was present in 9% of serial AML samples. Overall, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were observed in over 23% of AML patients.  HIGHLIGHTS  All IDH mutations reported in cancer share a common neomorphic enzymatic activity. Both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 are required for cell proliferation. IDH2 R140Q mutations occur in 9% of AML cases. Overall, IDH2 mutations appear more common than IDH1 mutations in AML.  
1770||Cancer genome characterization efforts now provide an initial view of the somatic alterations in primary tumors. However, most point mutations occur at low frequency, and the function of these alleles remains undefined. We have developed a scalable systematic approach to interrogate the function of cancer-associated gene variants. We subjected 474 mutant alleles curated from 5,338 tumors to pooled in vivo tumor formation assays and gene expression profiling. We identified 12 transforming alleles, including two in genes (PIK3CB, POT1) that have not been shown to be tumorigenic. One rare KRAS allele, D33E, displayed tumorigenicity and constitutive activation of known RAS effector pathways. By comparing gene expression changes induced upon expression of wild-type and mutant alleles, we inferred the activity of specific alleles. Because alleles found to be mutated only once in 5,338 tumors rendered cells tumorigenic, these observations underscore the value of integrating genomic information with functional studies.  Significance: Experimentally inferring the functional status of cancer-associated mutations facilitates the interpretation of genomic information in cancer. Pooled in vivo screen and gene expression profiling identified functional variants and demonstrated that expression of rare variants induced tumorigenesis. Variant phenotyping through functional studies will facilitate defining key somatic events in cancer. Cancer Discov; 6(7); 714–26. ©2016 AACR.  See related commentary by Cho and Collisson, p. 694.  This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 681  Introduction  Describing the complete list of genes altered in cancer genomes has been a major goal of cancer research, with an expectation that identifying mutated cancer genes would elucidate the molecular basis of cancer and nominate potential therapeutic targets (1). Advancements in sequencing technologies have facilitated the initial description of the mutational landscape in many types of cancer (2, 3). Although these efforts have identified some new classes of oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes that occur at high frequency, the majority of somatically altered alleles are found at low frequency, making it difficult to differentiate functionally relevant alleles from neutral, passenger mutations (2). Computational approaches to predict the functional consequences of these low-incidence point mutants are informative but require experimental and clinical validation (4).  Increasing numbers of cancers are now being sequenced in clinical settings, and in some cases, this information directs therapeutic decisions (5–8). Although such efforts will facilitate recruitment to clinical trials of molecularly targeted agents, it is already clear that such efforts identify many somatically altered but unstudied alleles in known oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes as well as genes not previouslyimplicated in cancer initiation or progression (6, 9). At present, such alleles are either classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS) or are not reported (10, 11).  Although the in-depth study of single genes will eventually provide functional information for these cancer-associated alleles, it is now possible to systematically study the consequences of expressing mutant alleles at scale. To determine whether the systematic characterization of cancer alleles provides functional insights, we generated a large number of alleles identified in cancer genome sequencing studies and assessed the consequences of expressing these alleles on tumor formation and gene expression (Fig. 1A). This approach provides a scalable method to characterize and assign function to a large number of alleles identified by cancer genome sequencing efforts.  Figure 1.

B, distribution of incidence of the alleles included in the project. Of the 474 alleles included in this study, 73.8% were found to be mutated only once. C, alleles mutated frequently were also found to be mutated in larger numbers of lineages. The size of dots corresponds to the number of alleles in the same coordinate. Results  Creation of a Pan-Cancer Candidate Cancer Allele Panel  To create a panel of cancer alleles, we first identified candidate cancer genes by running MutSig2CV (12, 13) on a collection of 5,338 tumors representing 27 cancers that had been subjected to whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing. Specifically, we prioritized genes by their P value calculated from their individualized background mutation rate, which was determined by considering covariates such as gene expression level and DNA replication timing (12). These analyses identified 381 genes, 220 (58%) of which had templates present in the hORFeome 8.1 collection of cDNA clones (ref. 14; Supplementary Table S1). We selected 696 mutant alleles for reagent generation by considering local mutational density and evolutionary conservation (described in Methods). Of the 220 alleles for which we had templates, we generated 187 wild-type alleles and 474 of the 696 nominated mutated alleles (68%, 178 genes). In addition, we constructed and included a set of 232 open reading frames (ORF) with known functions as well as 24 control ORFs. These alleles were introduced into uniquely barcoded lentiviral vectors. In total, this collection included 1,163 ORFs (Methods; Supplementary Table S2).  The majority of the 474 mutant alleles were infrequently mutated in human cancers. Specifically, 350 (73.8%) of the mutant alleles were found only once, and 12.0% and 4.9% of the alleles were found twice and 3 times, respectively (Fig. 1B). We noted that as the frequency of an allele increased, that allele was more likely to be found in multiple lineages (Fig. 1C). These observations suggest that testing these alleles in a single-cell context may provide generalizable information.  High-Throughput Identification of Transforming Alleles In Vivo  The assessment of tumor formation potential in mice is a widely used method to assess the transforming function of specific alleles. We created a high-throughput platform to determine whether specific cancer-associated alleles induce tumor formation. For these studies, we used the genetically defined, immortalized human embryonic kidney cell line HA1E (15), and a HA1E variant expressing an activated MEK1DD allele (HA1E-M) as model systems. HA1E-M cells are primed for cell transformation and have been previously used to identify genes involved in cell transformation (16, 17). We expressed each of the 474 alleles in HA1E-M cells and then used an in vivo pooled strategy to assess the tumorigenic potential of each allele (Fig. 2A).  Figure 2. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 2. Pooled in vivo screen identifies novel transforming alleles. A, pooled in vivo screen design. B, tumor formation over an 18-week timeframe per pool. C, Pool 1, a positive control pool, showed consistent tumor composition across tumors. Each tumor is represented as a bar. The compositions of tumors are shown as different colors. D, KRASD33E induced tumor formation in Pool 5. E, NFE2L2G31R and POT1G76V induced tumor formation in Pool 4. F, NFE2L2G31R and PIK3CBE497D induced tumor formation in Pool 9. G, summary of the in vivo pooled screen. The x-axis shows penetrance, which was calculated to be (times each allele was more than 0.01% of tumor reads)/(number of sites the allele was implanted). Because tumor size cannot exceed 2 cm in the longest dimension, not all sites were observed for the full length of time. The y-axis shows maximum enrichment, which was calculated to be (maximum percentage of allele in any tumor) – (percentage of the allele in preinjection cell pellet). Positive controls (colored in gray) had penetrance of around 80%, and low maximum enrichment due to competition against each other. Based on optimization experiments, we placed all 474 alleles into seven different pools (Pools 1–7) and segregated known oncogenic alleles into Pool 1, to reduce the possibility that known transforming alleles would dominate tumor formation and mask weaker oncogenic alleles. Pool 8 is a biological replicate of Pool 1. We scrambled alleles in Pools 2–7 into Pools 9–14 to create an additional set of pools, to give each allele two different sets of pool neighbors to increase sensitivity. The pool composition is described in Supplementary Table S3. We transduced each of the alleles into HA1E-M cells in an arrayed format, then pooled and expanded cells for tumorigenicity studies (Fig. 2A; Methods). Barcode sequencing of ORFs confirmed that nearly all of the alleles were represented upon implantation, although we noted that the representation of the alleles was not equal, likely due to the differences in viral titer because of differences in the length of each ORF and nucleotide composition (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1D).  Pools consisting of known cancer alleles (Pools 1 and 8) formed tumors within 1 to 2 weeks (Fig. 2B), and all 8 mice in these pools were sacrificed by week 3. Pools 7 and 14, experimental pools with a total of 110 unique alleles, failed to form any tumors after 18 weeks, confirming previous works showing that the background rate of tumor formation is low in this experimental model (refs. 16, 17; Fig. 2B). We harvested 69 tumors from 168 implantation sites and quantified the barcodes associated with each ORF by PCR amplification and sequencing (Methods; Supplementary Table S4A–S4N).  We observed that tumors derived from Pools 1 and 8, which were composed of known oncogenic alleles, repeatedly demonstrated a similar pattern of allele representation, mainly composed of NRAS and KRAS alleles (Fig. 2C). In contrast, we found that tumors derived from other experimental pools showed a wide diversity of allele representation. Some pools contained a single dominant oncogenic allele, whereas others included several oncogenic alleles (Fig. 2D–F). Certain alleles, such as KRASD33E, were found enriched in all tumors in which they were assessed; we labeled these alleles as highly penetrant (Fig. 2G). Other alleles such as POT1G76V were less penetrant, but they were highly enriched in a few tumors (Fig. 2E and G). We considered alleles that were found at more than 1% in at least two tumors or more than 90% in at least one tumor to have scored. KRASA59G, AKT1L52R, AKT1Q79K, NFE2L2G31R, NFE2L2WT, PIK3CBE497D, and FAM200AS481N alleles also scored in the pooled screen (Fig. 2G; Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2H).  The pooled nature of the screen forces competition among alleles in the same pool. For example, in Pool 1, only eight alleles of 77 were represented at 1% or higher in tumors, and when a lower threshold of 0.01% was applied, 24 alleles met the cutoff (Supplementary Table S4C). Known oncogenic alleles such as AKT1E17K failed to score due to competition, even though this allele is known to transform in this cell context (17). Nevertheless, these observations allowed us to identify a subset of somatically altered alleles that induce tumor formation in this context.  Gene Expression Correlation Analysis Differentiates Allele Function  In parallel to testing the tumorigenic potential of each allele in vivo, we created expression signatures for each of these alleles by expressing the 1,163 constructs in HA1E cells (15). We selected this cell line because established cancer cell lines harbor many genetic alterations, which could confound the interpretation of expressing each allele. We decided to use HA1E cells, and not HA1E-M cells, which were used in the in vivo screen, to eliminate the contribution of an overexpressed MEKDD allele. We measured transcript levels of 978 landmark genes using the L1000 Luminex bead–based gene expression assay (ref. 18; Methods). Using the normalized gene expression change induced by each overexpressed allele, we calculated the pairwise Spearman correlation coefficient of all the alleles included in the study (Fig. 3A). We excluded alleles with low infection efficiency (less than 40%), allowing us to assess 1,036 perturbations (Methods; Supplementary Table S5).  Figure 3. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 3. Gene expression profiling differentiates functional variants. A, expression signatures were analyzed by pairwise Spearman correlation to identify similar or dissimilar alleles to the allele of interest. B, KRASG12V induces similar gene expression changes as other known activating alleles of KRAS and NRAS. C, NRASQ61H induces similar gene expression changes as other known activating alleles of NRAS. However, the signature from the novel Y64D allele had a lower correlation, similar to wild-type (WT). D, IDH1/2 alleles were correlated to known activating mutant IDH2R172K. Other known activating alleles of IDH1/2 are highly correlated to IDH2R172K. E, when correlated to the PTEN wild-type, F90S, R233Q, K6N, and R173H correlated strongly with the wild-type PTEN. The known loss-of-function, dominant-negative allele G129E showed a lower correlation. G127R, G129V, and G127V also showed low correlation to the wild-type. F, when alleles were correlated against SPOPF102C, a loss-of-function, dominant-negative SPOP allele, other known loss-of-function, dominant-negative alleles W131G, F133S, K134N, and W131C were highly correlated. On the other hand, E50K, K101I, and E47A had lower correlation to F102C. G, FBXW7 wild-type, R658Q, I347M, S462Y, and R689Q were strongly anticorrelated to MYC. Known dominant-negative alleles (R505C, R465C, and R465H) no longer were anticorrelated to MYC. BRD4 wild-type was the most closely correlated to MYC. Using the pairwise Spearman correlation coefficient between every pair of alleles included in the study, we first examined whether we could detect known relationships. For instance, we found that the expression relationship of KRASG12V, a well-known gain-of-function mutant of KRAS, correlated highly with other known oncogenic KRAS and NRAS mutants (Fig. 3B). Other known oncogenic alleles such as AKTE17K did not correlate with the KRAS signature, demonstrating that this correlation was not simply the consequence of a prosurvival signal induced by an oncogenic allele. Novel alleles of KRAS, D33E and E62K correlated less strongly to known KRAS-activating mutants but were clearly differentiated from the wild-type alleles, suggesting they may be activating mutants (Fig. 3B). In addition, when we examined NRASQ61H, a known activating mutant of NRAS, we found that this allele was highly correlated with other oncogenic NRAS mutants, but that the novel Y64D allele was more similar to the wild-type NRAS allele, suggesting that this allele is likely to be a passenger allele (Fig. 3C). Indeed, Y64D did not score in the pooled in vivo screen.  In addition to oncogenic RAS alleles, we also found a correlation among activating mutations for other known oncogenes such as IDH1/2 (Fig. 3D). Specifically, we found that other known gain-of-function mutants, IDH2R172M, IDH1R132C, IDH1R132S, IDH1R132H, and IDH1R132L, were highly correlated to the known gain-of-function mutant IDH2R172K (19). On the other hand, the IDH1 E190K and P33S alleles and the IDH2 G137E, E268D, A416V, A47V, T331M, and I138F alleles failed to correlate to known activating mutants, suggesting these alleles were more similar to the wild-type allele (Fig. 3D).  Next, we investigated PTEN, a commonly mutated tumor-suppressor gene, whose loss of function leads to constitutive activation of the PI3K signaling pathway (20). Among the eight PTEN alleles included in this study, F90S, R233Q, K6N, and R173H correlated with the signature induced by overexpressing wild-type PTEN, suggesting that these alleles did not completely inactivate PTEN function (Fig. 3E). The F90S mutant was recently shown to retain lipid phosphatase activity but was unable to translocate to the plasma membrane (21). R233Q may also affect localization (22). The R173H variant was previously reported to lack phosphoinositide phosphatase activity (23), but its effect was later reported to be less severe (24). Our data support the notion that R173H retains residual PTEN function. In contrast, a known loss-of-function, dominant interfering allele (G129E; refs. 25, 26) failed to correlate with the wild-type allele. We also found that signatures from the G129V, G127V, and G127R alleles were clearly distinct from the wild-type allele and moderately correlated to G129E (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B), suggesting that these alleles are also likely to be loss-of-function variants. Other alleles that activate PI3K signaling (AKT1E17K) were anticorrelated with wild-type PTEN (Fig. 3E).  We used a similar approach to differentiate several alleles of SPOP, a gene mutated in prostate and endometrial cancers (refs. 27, 28; Fig. 3F). Specifically, we found that the W131G, F133S, K134N, and W131C alleles strongly correlated with F102C, a known loss-of-function, dominant-negative variant (29, 30), but that the wild-type, K101I, E50K, and E47A alleles did not correlate with the F102C allele. Codons F102, W131, F133, and K134 are mutated mostly in prostate cancers, and E47 and E50 are altered in endometrial cancers (27, 28, 31). Recently, SPOP was shown to induce ubiquitination and degradation of androgen receptor and the ETS transcription factor ERG in prostate cancer and estrogen receptor-α in endometrial cancer, but the SPOP mutants were impaired in this ubiquitination activity (29, 30, 32, 33). When we looked for alleles correlated to the E50K loss-of-function allele in endometrial cancer (32), E47A was highly correlated, suggesting that this allele may also be a loss-of-function allele (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Gene expression signatures of E47 and E50 variants clustered with that of wild-type but were distinct from F102, W131, F133, and K134 variants (Supplementary Fig. S3D). These findings suggest that gene expression analysis may allow nuanced interpretation of loss-of-function alleles that are associated with specific context. Because missense mutations in tumor-suppressor genes tend to occur throughout their coding sequences, it is often difficult to differentiate functional from nonfunctional mutations by inspecting the mutations or their frequency. Examining gene expression changes induced by these mutations may facilitate the classification of missense mutant alleles.  We also examined which of the included alleles correlated with the proto-oncogene MYC, a commonly amplified oncogenic transcription factor (34). The most positively correlated allele in our dataset was wild-type BRD4, which encodes a transcriptional activator of MYC (Fig. 3G; ref. 35). BRD4 has been shown to regulate MYC transcription, and pharmacologic modulation of BRD4 inhibited proliferation in MYC-dependent cancers (35). We found that the FBXW7 wild-type, R658Q, I347M, R689Q, and S462Y alleles were anticorrelated to wild-type MYC (Fig. 3G). FBXW7 is the substrate recognition component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase targeting MYC (36), suggesting that these four alleles do not affect FBXW7 function. In contrast, we found that the known dominant interfering alleles, FBXW7 R505C, R465C, and R465H (37, 38), were anticorrelated to wild-type FBXW7, in consonance with the interpretation that these alleles inhibit endogenous wild-type FBXW7 (Supplementary Fig. S3E).  Validation of Rare Oncogenic Alleles  To validate the tumor formation of rare alleles, we performed individual tumorigenicity experiments with the candidate oncogenic alleles and their allelic series (Fig. 4A–D; Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4C). We defined a tumorigenic allele as an allele that formed any tumor larger than 500 mm3 by 130 days. We validated that AKT1L52R, NFE2L2G31R, POT1G76V, KRASD33E, and KRASA59G were tumorigenic. In addition, some alleles that did not score in the pooled screen formed tumors in individual experiments, including KRASE62K, PIK3CBA1048V, NFE2L2G31A, NFE2L2G31V, NFE2L2N160S, AKT1E267G, and AKT1R370C.

The KRASD33E and KRASA59G alleles formed tumors robustly. E62K did not form tumors in the pooled assay but formed tumors in individual assays, at a later time point. B, individual tumor validation of NFE2L2 alleles. In the pooled assay, only G31R scored in multiple tumors. In the individual assay, G31V, G31A, and T80K formed tumors as well. N160S formed tumors at a later time point. NFE2L2 wild-type formed one small tumor by the end of the experiment. C, individual tumor validation of PIK3CB alleles. E497D and wild-type formed tumors after long latency. PIK3CBA1048V formed tumors with shorter latency at the majority of injection sites. D, individual tumor validation of POT1 alleles. The G76V allele formed tumors at a later time point. One of the POT1G76V mice died of unknown cause. E, the structure of KRAS (PDB: 4EPV) shows that all four of the mutants are in close spatial proximity. Mutated residues are shown in red, and GDP bound to the substrate pocket is shown in blue. F, immunoblot of KRAS alleles (including other positive control alleles) shows increased phosphorylated (p) ERK and pAKT1 levels in KRASD33E and KRASA59G overexpressed cells. G, RAF binding domain pull-down assay shows increased GTP-bound KRAS in D33E and A59G mutants. H, quantitative PCR of NFE2L2 mRNA expression shows all alleles were expressed. I, immunoblot of NFE2L2 alleles shows increased NFE2L2 protein level in G31A, G31R, G31V, and T80K overexpressed cells. There was no change in pERK or pAKT1 levels. We found that the KRASD33E and KRASA59G alleles were potently tumorigenic, whereas the KRASE62K allele induced tumor formation at much longer latencies (Fig. 4A). When we mapped the KRASD33E, KRASE62K, and KRASA59G on the KRAS structure (39), we found that these mutations occur in close proximity with known transforming alleles (Fig. 4E). Cells expressing KRASD33E and KRASA59G showed increased activation of the MAP kinase and PI3K pathways as assessed by phosphorylation of specific effectors and a RAF binding domain pull-down assay (Fig. 4F and G). These observations suggest that these rare KRAS alleles are indeed oncogenic.  When we examined the NFE2L2 allelic series, we found that the G31R, G31V, G31A, and T80K alleles robustly formed tumors (Fig. 4B), whereas the N160S allele formed small tumors at a much later time point. We note that expression of wild-type NFE2L2 induced the formation of a single tumor at long latency. Tumor formation by NFE2L2 wild-type overexpression was also observed in the pooled screen (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2G). In consonance with these observations, we found that tumorigenic NFE2L2 mutants were expressed at higher levels, likely due to defective degradation by endogenous KEAP1 (Fig. 4H and I). Gene expression analysis of NFE2L2 mutants showed a similar gene expression pattern to that of wild-type, presumably because overexpression of the wild-type allele induced similar gene expression changes, as did the overexpression of gain-of-function mutants in the short-term gene expression assay (Supplementary Fig. S5). These observations demonstrate that the in vivo tumorigenicity assay differentiates gain-of-function mutants even when we were unable to detect a difference in short-term in vitro gene expression assays.  In individual tumor assays, PIK3CBE497D showed delayed tumor formation, similar to what we observed when we expressed the wild-type PIK3CB (Fig. 4C), implying that E497D is a passenger mutation. Wild-type PIK3CB was previously shown to induce foci in a foci formation assay (40). PIK3CBA1048V, on the other hand, induced tumors in the majority of replicates with shorter latency, demonstrating that PIK3CBA1048V is a transforming gain-of-function mutant. In the POT1 allelic series, we noted that only POT1G76V formed tumors in individual tumor experiments after long latency (Fig. 4D). POT1 was recently shown to be mutated in familial melanoma (41, 42), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (43), familial glioma (44), and cardiac angiosarcoma (45). In particular, the Y89C, Q94E, R273L, Y223C, and S270N alleles were previously shown to be loss-of-function alleles, resulting in elongated telomeres and increased genomic instability (41, 42). These observations suggest that POT1G76V may also contribute to cell transformation through a similar mechanism.  Although some of the alleles that we found induced tumor formation were recurrently observed in particular human cancer types, we noted that many of the alleles that we found were able to induce tumor formation, including KRASD33E, KRASE62K, NFE2L2G31R, NFE2L2G31V, NFE2L2N160S, POT1G76V, and PIK3CBA1048V, were found to be mutated only once in our set of 5,338 tumors. These observations demonstrate that rare alleles may be functionally important in tumorigenesis.  To investigate whether high-throughput functional phenotyping complements in silico predictions, we compared our observations pertaining to 71 alleles analyzed herein with four different in silico methods, PolyPhen-2 (46), Mutation Assessor (47), CHASM (48), and VEST (49). Each of these methods makes predictions about whether a mutation is likely to affect protein function but does not attempt to predict whether the mutation induces gain or loss of function. To compare these approaches, we used the term “functional variant” to denote both gain-of-function and loss-of-function alleles (50) and “neutral variant” for all other alleles. The concordance rates between each of these methods and our approach ranged from 66% to 77% (Methods; Supplementary Table S6; Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B), suggesting that gene expression comparisons provided additional information about gene function. For example, PolyPhen-2 and CHASM predicted that SPOPK134N was likely to be a functional variant, whereas Mutation Assessor and VEST assessed this to be a neutral variant. We found that the gene expression of SPOPK134N correlated with that of SPOPF102C, providing evidence that this allele is a functional variant. Together, these observations suggest that the experimental characterization of alleles complements in silico methods.  Discussion  Cancer genome sequencing projects have already identified thousands of variants of unknown significance, and this number is likely to increase rapidly as more tumors are sequenced. Here, we report a pilot study to facilitate functional characterization of these alleles by creating a large number of cancer-associated variants and testing them in two phenotypic assays. Using an in vivo tumorigenesis assay and gene expression profiling, we identified a subset of these variants that exhibit tumorigenic phenotypes and induced changes in gene expression different from those of wild-type or known gain-of-function counterparts. This study provides proof-of-principle evidence that large-scale mutant characterization both is tractable and provides new information about the functional relevance of many alleles.  We recognize that these studies are not exhaustive. For example, we performed all experiments using immortalized kidney epithelial cells, thus limiting those genes that are potentially transforming in a specific tissue context. In addition, the tumorigenesis assay we used here does not assess all tumor-essential phenotypes, and this experimental design does not permit the discovery of loss-of-function tumor-suppressor alleles. For example, alleles involved in metastasis, angiogenesis, immune response, and splicing changes may not score in this assay. Weaker transforming alleles may be masked by stronger oncogenic alleles in the pooled format used in these experiments, and it is possible that there are both productive and inhibitory interactions between cells harboring different alleles. Furthermore, alleles that affect pathways that were already perturbed in our engineered system, which include inhibition of TP53 and RB as well as hTERT and MEKDD overexpression, are not likely to be discovered in this context. Also, in cases where presumable mechanisms involve stochastic accumulation of mutations over long time periods, as in the case of genes involved in genomic instability such as POT1, these genes may not reliably score in this context. However, considering the very low background tumor formation rate in this assay, even a single instance of tumor formation lends support for future studies. As such, this approach provides a powerful paradigm to discover functionally relevant rare alleles that may otherwise not be considered for functional studies due to their rarity. Further studies such as those described herein using similar approaches in other genetic and lineage contexts will facilitate the comprehensive discovery of transforming alleles.  Using gene expression signatures generated by expressing wild-type or mutant alleles, we found that some PTEN, FBXW7, NRAS, IDH1/2, and SPOP alleles resembled the wild-type alleles or known functional variants, suggesting that these alleles are functionally similar to those alleles. On the other hand, in oncogenes such as NFE2L2, we found that gain-of-function mutants induced similar gene expression signatures as the wild-type allele. This observation suggests that some truly transforming alleles may not score in the short term in vitro gene expression assay. Furthermore, for genes whose mechanism of action involves longer-term processes such as DNA repair, the acute effect of overexpressing alleles may not be reflected in gene expression changes. Combining expression profiling with tumor formation or other phenotypic experiments may provide complementary information in these cases.  Using the in vivo tumorigenesis assay, we identified rare mutants with transforming function, such as KRASD33E. As this variant was identified only once in the cohort of 5,338 tumors, a large number of tumors would need to be sequenced before the frequency of this allele reached statistical significance. As KRAS mutational status is already used in directing therapeutic decisions (51), this observation demonstrates the importance of studying rare alleles for accurate patient stratification. PIK3CBA1048V and POT1G76V were also rare alleles that were found only once in our cohort. PIK3CB was recently shown to be mutated in prostate cancer (52), and computational analysis using network mutation burden nominated PIK3CB to be a significantly mutated gene (53). Although further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms by which PIK3CBA1048V and POT1G76V contribute to malignant transformation, this study provides evidence that these alleles are indeed transforming alleles.  In this study, we focused on alleles that have been identified in cancer genome sequencing efforts. An alternative approach would be to create a set of alleles where each amino acid is substituted to prospectively identify alleles that alter wild-type gene function and to interrogate the relationship among evolutionary conservation, gene function, and prevalence of mutations in tumors. Although this type of study is not yet feasible at the scale presented here, our studies suggest that expanding the number of alleles in genes will provide useful information. We acknowledge that arbitrarily limiting the number of alleles per gene, especially in known cancer genes, excluded some well-studied alleles. Including additional criteria, such as 3-D spatial clustering (54), may increase the sensitivity of discovering functional alleles. Expanding the number of alleles in genes, especially those already used in clinical decision making, is also desirable. Furthermore, high-throughput adaptation of other functional assays, such as experiments that quantify morphologic changes as well as proteomic and epigenetic differences, will expand our knowledge of the functional consequences of mutant alleles.  In summary, these studies demonstrate that systematically performing functional assays complements the structural information gathered from the sequencing efforts to accelerate the interpretation of cancer-associated variants. We anticipate that as additional tumors are characterized in both research and clinical settings, additional cancer-associated genes and alleles will be identified, and the approach described here can be useful to ascertain the function of these alleles. Using diverse cellular backgrounds and different phenotypic assays will also increase the power to detect functional variants and reduce false negatives. As more functional data become available, we may also be able to gain insights into empirically improving the accuracy of mutation impact–calling algorithms by incorporating information from high-confidence functional data. This iterative process between functional and structural genomics will synergistically facilitate the complete description of cancer-associated mutations.  Methods  Mutated Gene Curation  Mutated genes (n = 271) were called from the analysis of 5,338 tumor normal pairs by running MutSig2CV and setting the q-value cutoff at 0.1. The algorithm was described previously (13). Thirteen genes were manually added (PIK3C2G, PIK3R2, PIK3CG, PIK3C2B, PIK3CB, PIK3C2A, PIK3R4, BCL2, BCL3, BCL6, BCL9, BCOR, and ISX). Forty-nine likely false-positive genes (genes with high background mutation rate) and 48 randomly chosen, likely neutral genes, were added. A total of 381 genes were selected for the project. Of these genes, 220 had a matching template in the hORFeome 8.1 collection, and these were used for subsequent steps (Supplementary Table S1).  Selection of Alleles from Significantly Mutated Genes  For each missense mutation, “priority” was calculated, which was defined as “density” (local concentration of mutations) multiplied by conservation.  Priority = mutation density × conservation.  Mutation density was calculated by counting the number of mutations in a 20-bp window, with the allele of interest at the center of the window. Conservation was calculated using phyloP (55), which scores evolutionary conservation from sequence alignment of 46 vertebrates. Conservation values were scaled linearly to range from 0 to 100.  We chose an allele by taking the highest-priority mutated allele. The same procedure was repeated until we selected as many alleles as desired. The number of alleles selected for each gene was decided by the number of times the gene was mutated in patients.  If a gene was mutated in 120 patients or more, then 8 alleles were chosen.  If a gene was mutated in 100 patients or more, then 7 alleles were chosen.  If a gene was mutated in 80 patients or more, then 6 alleles were chosen.  If a gene was mutated in 70 patients or more, then 5 alleles were chosen.  If a gene was mutated in 60 patients or more, then 4 alleles were chosen.  If a gene was mutated in 50 patients or more, then 3 alleles were chosen.  If a gene was mutated in 30 patients or more, then 2 alleles were chosen.  Otherwise, one allele per gene was chosen.  For HRAS, SPOP, MAP2K1, B2M, AKT1, RHOA, IDH1, and IDH2, eight alleles were chosen.  For genes with one or two alleles selected, we considered all the mutations as “experimental” alleles. For genes with three or more alleles selected, we selected one allele that we predicted to be less likely to be functional as a “control” allele. The other alleles were considered “experimental” alleles. The “control” allele was chosen as an internal control that is less likely than the “experimental” alleles to be functional. The “control” alleles were chosen by the following criteria.  Remove any positions that were chosen above.  Remove any mutations with conservation above a threshold of 60.  For the remaining mutations, define controlpriority = (100 − conservation)/(# of times that exact mutation occurs)⁁2.  Add a bonus for mutations that are close to the first or second mutations chosen above. If the distance between the first or second experimental allele and the control allele was less than one fifth of the total gene length, a bonus of 20 was given. If the distance between the first or second experimental allele and the control allele was less than one third of the total gene length, a bonus of 10 was given.  Choose the mutated allele with the highest controlpriority + bonus.  All selected alleles are shown in Supplementary Table S1.  Barcoded Mutant Allele Generation in Lentiviral Vectors  We used a previously published method to perform high-throughput mutagenesis (56). Briefly, each ORF was PCR amplified using primers that contain mutated sequence incorporated. These fragments were transferred to the pDONR223 vector (Invitrogen) through BP cloning (Invitrogen), and the constructs were transformed into competent cells. The discontinuity at the mutation introduction site was repaired by endogenous bacterial repair mechanism. The mutated ORF was transferred to the barcoded destination vector by LR reaction (Invitrogen).  Lentivirus Generation  Viruses were prepared according to the RNAi Consortium (TRC) virus protocol.  Cell Lines  HA1E-M and HA1E cell lines were established in our laboratory and were authenticated by using a Fluidigm-enabled genotyping assay that queries a set of 96 SNP markers. Both cell lines were cultured in MEM-alpha (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) supplementation. Both cell lines tested negative for Mycoplasma.  Multiplexed In Vivo Screening  All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. To determine whether the number of cells transduced with a particular allele in a pool of approximately 80 alleles was sufficient to form tumors, we performed serial dilution and subcutaneous injection with the activating KRAS allele G12V and found that cells diluted to a representation of 1/96 dilution (approximately 20,000 cells) formed tumors in all injection sites. For the screen, 2,500 HA1E-M cells were plated in 100 μL of media per well in a 96-well plate on day 1. On day 2, polybrene was added to a final concentration of 4 μg/mL, and 12 μL of arrayed viral supernatant was added to the target cell plates. Plates were spun at 2,250 rpm for 30 minutes at room temperature. After 4 hours, media were changed. After 18 hours, puromycin was added to a final concentration of 2 μg/mL. After 48 hours of puromycin selection, cells were trypsinized and pooled. We note that 96 wells were combined into one pool per pool composition (Supplementary Table S3). Cell pellets were taken immediately after pooling (called “pre-expansion”), and also on day 15 to use as a reference points for future analysis. Transduced HA1E-M cells were propagated for 15 days to obtain at least 60 million cells per pool. More than 90% of the ORFs in each pool were represented at 0.01% of the injected cell population (Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D). We note that alleles with even lower representation, such as NFE2L2G31R, which represented 0.0089% of the cells in preinjection cell pellet of Pool 4, formed multiple tumors.  On day 15, cells were trypsinized, washed, and counted (called “pre-injection”). Five million cells were prepped in 200 μL of PBS per injection site, except Pools 2 and 11, for which 4 million cells were prepped per site. Three sites—interscapular area, right and left flanks—were injected in each mouse, and 4 mice were injected per pool (12 sites per pool). Mice were monitored for tumor formation, and the longest dimension of each tumor was measured. Tumors were harvested when they reached around 2 cm. The tumor tissue was finely minced and subjected to genomic DNA extraction with Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit. Genomic DNA (1 μg) was subjected to PCR amplification for barcode demultiplexing by sequencing. To amplify the barcodes with Illumina sequencing primer integrated, the following primers were used (different sequence components are demarcated by “<>”):  P5 ORF primer:  <P5 flow cell attachment sequence><Illumina sequencing primer><Vector primer binding>  <AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCT><ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT[s]><TCTTGTGGAAAGGACGA>  P7 ORF primer:  <P7 flow cell attachment sequence><Barcode><Illumina sequencing primer><Vector primer binding>  <CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT><NNNNNNNN><GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT><TAAAGCAGCGTATCCACATAGCGT>  Upon amplification, the PCR products were purified with AMPure beads and subjected to Illumina sequencing. On average, 1.6 million reads were obtained per tumor.  In Vivo Screening Analysis  The barcode reads were demultiplexed by custom scripts. Less than 1% of contaminating reads (barcode reads that do not belong to the specific pool) were found and removed. The rest of the reads were normalized by dividing the number of reads by the total number of reads from the tumor. Penetrance was calculated by (number of times in which specific allele was represented at more than 0.01%)/(number of times that allele was injected). Because the mouse needs to be sacrificed when the biggest tumor reaches a certain diameter per protocol, not all three sites per mouse were observed for a full 18 weeks. Maximum enrichment was calculated by (maximum percentage of tumor reads each allele accounted for) – (percentage of that allele in preinjection cell pellet). We defined “scoring allele” as an allele that was found at more than 1% in at least two tumors or more than 90% in at least one tumor.  Expression Profiling Using L1000  L1000 is a high-throughput, bead-based gene expression assay in which mRNA is extracted from cultured human cells treated with various chemical or genomic perturbagens (small molecules, gene knockdowns, or gene overexpression constructs). HA1E cells were plated at 400 cells per well in 384-well plates. The next day, cells were transduced with 3 μL of lentiviral supernatant by spin infection. Infections were performed in five replicates, two of which were used to assess infection efficiency and the remaining three for gene expression profiling. Following 24-hour incubation, media and virus were removed and replaced with complete growth media or media containing antibiotics (for infection efficiency calculation). Cell plates used for gene expression analysis were not selected to reduce the effect of antibiotics on the gene expression. Ninety-six hours after infection, cells were lysed with the addition of TCL buffer (Qiagen) and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. mRNA is reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA. Gene-specific probes containing barcodes and universal primer sites are annealed to the first-strand cDNA. The probes are ligated to form a template for PCR. The template is PCR-amplified with biotinylated universal primers. The end products are biotinylated, fixed-length, barcoded amplicons. The amplicons are then mixed with Luminex beads that contain complementary barcodes to those encoded in each of the 978 amplified landmark genes. These beads are then stained with fluorescent streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SAPE) and detected in 384-well plate format on a Luminex FlexMap flow cytometry–based scanner. The resulting readout is a measure of mean fluorescent intensity for each landmark gene. The raw expression data are log2-scaled, quantile-normalized, and z-scored, such that a differential expression value is achieved for each gene in each well. These differential expression values are collapsed across replicate wells using a weighted average to yield a differential expression signature for each perturbagen. Each replicate is weighted according to its correlation with the others. These signatures were used for subsequent analysis. Detailed protocol is available at the LINCS website.  Gene Expression Correlation Analysis  Normalized gene expression data were filtered by infection efficiency, which was calculated by dividing cell viability after antibiotic selection with cell viability without antibiotic selection by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). Viability was assessed 96 hours after infection. Forty percent infection efficiency was used as cutoff to filter inadequately transduced alleles. A total of 1,036 gene expression signatures were Spearman correlated with gene expression signatures of all other ORFs. “cor(method = “spearman”)” function in R was used for Spearman correlation coefficient calculation (57). Negative controls (BFP, eGFP, HcRed, LacZ, Luciferase) and L1000 expression plate controls (NFE2L2, RHEB, NFKB1A, DNMT3A) were also included. After pairwise Spearman correlation, alleles at the extreme ends of the spectrum were manually curated to find alleles that were consistent with previously known relationships.  Stable Cell Line Generation for Validation  For individual validation experiments, the same vector used for the pooled screen was used to generate lentiviruses. Eighty thousand 293T cells were plated in one well of 6-well plates. Delta8.9 (900 ng), vsv-g (100 ng), and the ORF vectors (1 μg) were transfected in 3 μL of TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus Bio). The viral supernatant was collected after 48 hours and was frozen at −80°C until use. HA1E-M cells were plated in 6-well plates at 100,000 cells per well. HA1E-M cells were transduced with 300 μL of viral supernatant in 8 μL/mL polybrene and were spin-infected at 2,250 rpm for 30 minutes. The next day, the media were changed to selection media (puromycin 2 μg/mL). After 48 hours of selection, cells were cultured in puromycin-free MEM-alpha complete media (Invitrogen).  Screen Validation  Six-week-old male homozygous NCR-Nu mice (Taconic) were used for xenograft experiments. HA1E-M cell lines stably expressing individual candidate alleles were injected at 2 × 106 cells per site, except for NFE2L2 alleles, which were injected at 1 × 106 cells per site. Each stable cell line was injected at three sites per animal, and into two animals, for a total of six sites per cell line. Tumor formation was monitored using calipers twice weekly for 130 days. Tumor volume was calculated as ((tumor length) × (tumor width) ⁁ 2))/2. We defined scoring allele in validation experiment as an allele that formed any tumor larger than 500 mm3 by 130 days.  KRAS Structure Analysis  KRAS mutations of interest were overlaid onto the structure of the protein product (PDB: 4EPV) and visualized the structure using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.7.4 Schrödinger; LLC).  Immunoblots  Protein lysates were resolved on either 7.5% or 4%–12% gradient gels (Bio-Rad), transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) using standard wet-transfer procedures, and incubated with primary antibodies as indicated. All immunoblot assays were visualized using a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imager. The following antibodies were used:  KRAS (Proteintech Group; 12063-1-AP), RAS [Cell Signaling Technology (CST); 3965], RAS (clone 10; EMD Millipore; 05-516), pERK (CST; 4370), ERK (CST; 9102), pAKT (S473; CST; 4060), α-tubulin (Sigma Aldrich; clone DM1A; T9026), NRF2 (CST; 12721), and NRF2 (R&D Systems; AF3925). Secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IRDye antibodies were from LI-COR Biosciences. Secondary antibodies and α-tubulin were used at 1:5;000 dilution, NRF2 antibodies at 1:500 dilution, and all other antibodies at 1:1,000 dilution.  RAS Activation Assay  RAS activation assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Millipore; 17-218). In brief, cells were cultured on 6-well dishes and harvested for lysates. A sample of each lysate was saved for input (total RAS load), and the remaining lysate was rocked with glutathione-sepharose 1:1 RAF–RBD slurry in lysis buffer for 1 hour at 4°C. The beads were then washed 3 times with ice-cold lysis buffer, followed by addition of Laemmli/SDS buffer to elute the bound proteins. The RAS-GTP pull-down samples were loaded and resolved on 12% polyacrylamide SDS gels (Bio-Rad).  Quantitative Real-Time PCR  The RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) was used to purify total RNA from cells, and cDNA was generated using Superscript III Vilo (Life Technologies). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR reagents (Life Technologies) on an ABI-7300 instrument following a two-step cycling protocol with the following primers:  NFE2L2_FWD: CACATCCAGTCAGAAACCAGTGG  NFE2L2_REV: GGAATGTCTGCGCCAAAAGCTG  ACTB FWD: CACCATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTC  ACTB REV: AGGTCTTTGCGGATGTCCACGT  Relative expression was calculated using the ΔΔCt method with ACTB for normalization between samples.  Comparison to the In Silico Methods  We compared our observations to four different in silico methods: PolyPhen-2 (46), Mutation Assessor (47), CHASM (48), and VEST (49). We used the term “functional variant” to denote both gain and loss of function alleles (50), and “neutral variant” otherwise. For PolyPhen-2, “possibly damaging” and “probably damaging” categories were considered functional variants. We used the HumDiv-trained version of PolyPhen-2. For Mutation Assessor, “high” and “medium” were considered functional variants. For CHASM and VEST, alleles with FDR <0.05 were considered functional variants. Default parameters were used for PolyPhen-2 and Mutation Assessor, and “cancer type: other” was chosen for CHASM analysis. The Venn diagram was drawn with Venny (58).  The somatic mutations in cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) observed in gliomas can lead to the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). Here, we report that tumor 2HG is elevated in a high percentage of patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Surprisingly, less than half of cases with elevated 2HG possessed IDH1 mutations. The remaining cases with elevated 2HG had mutations in IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. These data demonstrate that a shared feature of all cancer-associated IDH mutations is production of the onco-metabolite 2HG. Furthermore, AML patients with IDH mutations display a significantly reduced number of other well characterized AML-associated mutations and/or associated chromosomal abnormalities, potentially implicating IDH mutation in a distinct mechanism of AML pathogenesis.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Mutations in human cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase I (IDH1) occur somatically in >70% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas, and in 8.5% of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) (Mardis et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Mutations have also been reported in cancers of the colon and prostate (Kang et al., 2009; Sjoblom et al., 2006). To date, all reported IDH1 mutations result in an amino acid substitution at a single arginine residue in the enzyme’s active site, R132. A subset of intermediate grade gliomas lacking mutations in IDH1 have been found to harbor mutations in IDH2, the mitochondrial homolog of IDH1. The IDH2 mutations which have been identified in gliomas occur at the analogous residue to IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172. Both IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutants lack the wild-type enzyme’s ability to convert isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (Yan et al., 2009). To date, all reported IDH1 or IDH2 mutations are heterozygous, with the cancer cells retaining one wild-type copy of the relevant IDH1 or IDH2 allele. No patient has been reported with both an IDH1 and IDH2 mutation. These data argue against the IDH mutations resulting in a simple loss of function.  Normally both cytosolic IDH1 and mitochondrial IDH2 exist as homodimers within their respective cellular compartments, and the mutant proteins retain the ability to bind to their respective wild-type partner. Therefore, it has been proposed that mutant IDH1 can act as a dominant negative against wild-type IDH1 function, resulting in a decrease in cytosolic α-ketoglutarate levels and leading to an indirect activation of the HIF-1α pathway (Zhao et al., 2009). However, recent work has provided an alternative explanation. The R132H IDH1 mutation observed in gliomas was found to display a gain of function for the NADPH-dependent reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) (Dang et al., 2009). This in vitro activity was confirmed when 2HG was found to be elevated in IDH1-mutated gliomas. Whether this neomorphic activity is a common feature shared by IDH2 mutations was not determined.  IDH1 R132 mutations identical to those reported to produce 2HG in gliomas were recently reported in AML (Mardis et al., 2009). These IDH1 R132 mutations were observed in 8.5% of AML patients studied, and a significantly higher percentage of mutation was observed in the subset of patients whose tumors lacked cytogenetic abnormalities. IDH2 R172 mutations were not observed in this study. However, during efforts to confirm and extend these findings, we found an IDH2 R172K mutation in an AML sample obtained from a 77 year old female. This finding confirmed that both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations can occur in AML and prompted us to more comprehensively investigate the role of IDH2 in AML.  The present study was undertaken to see if IDH2 mutations might share the same neomorphic activity as recently reported for glioma-associated IDH1 R132 mutations. We also determined whether tumor-associated 2HG elevation could prospectively identify AML patients with mutations in IDH. To investigate the lack of reduction to homozygosity for either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations in tumor samples, the ability of wild-type IDH1 and/or IDH2 to contribute to cell proliferation was examined.  Go to: RESULTS IDH2 is mutated in AML  A recent study employing a whole-genome sequencing strategy in an AML patient resulted in the identification of somatic IDH1 mutations in AML (Mardis et al., 2009). Based on the report that IDH2 mutations were also observed in the other major tumor type in which IDH1 mutations were implicated (Yan et al., 2009), we sequenced the IDH2 gene in a set of de-identified AML DNA samples. Several cases with IDH2 R172 mutations were identified. In the initial case, the IDH2 mutation found, R172K, was the same mutation reported in glioma samples. It has been recently reported that cancer-associated IDH1 R132 mutants display a loss-of-function for the use of isocitrate as substrate, with a concomitant gain-of-function for the reduction of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). This prompted us to determine if the recurrent R172K mutation in IDH2 observed in both gliomas and leukemias might also display the same neomorphic activity. In IDH1, the role of R132 in determining IDH1 enzymatic activity is consistent with the stabilizing charge interaction of its guanidinium moiety with the β-carboxyl group of isocitrate (Figure 1A). This β-carboxyl is critical for IDH’s ability to catalyze the interconversion of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate, with the overall reaction occurring in two steps through a β-carboxyl-containing intermediate (Ehrlich and Colman, 1976). Proceeding in the oxidative direction, this β-carboxyl remains on the substrate throughout the IDH reaction until the final decarboxylating step which produces α-ketoglutarate.  Figure 1 Figure 1 IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 are analogous residues that both interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 are analogous residues that both interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate  To understand how R172 mutations in IDH2 might relate to the R132 mutations in IDH1 characterized for gliomas, we modeled human IDH2 based on the pig IDH2 structure containing bound isocitrate (Ceccarelli et al., 2002). Human and pig IDH2 protein share over 97% identity and all active site residues are identical. The active site of human IDH2 was structurally aligned with human IDH1 (Figure 1). Similar to IDH1, in the active site of IDH2 the isocitrate substrate is stabilized by multiple charge interactions throughout the binding pocket. Moreover, like R132 in IDH1, the analogous R172 in IDH2 is predicted to interact strongly with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate. This raised the possibility that cancer-associated IDH2 mutations at R172 might affect enzymatic interconversion of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate similarly to IDH1 mutations at R132.  Mutation of IDH2 R172K enhances α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption  To test whether cancer-associated IDH2 R172K mutations shared the gain of function in α-ketoglutarate reduction observed for IDH1 R132 mutations (Dang et al., 2009), we overexpressed wild-type or R172K mutant IDH2 in cells with endogenous wild-type IDH2 expression, and then assessed isocitrate-dependent NADPH production and α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates. As reported previously (Yan et al., 2009), extracts from cells expressing the R172K mutant IDH2 did not display isocitrate-dependent NADPH production above the levels observed in extracts from vector-transfected cells. In contrast, extracts from cells expressing a comparable amount of wild-type IDH2 markedly increased isocitrate-dependent NADPH production (Figure 2A). However, when these same extracts were tested for NADPH consumption in the presence of α-ketoglutarate, R172K mutant IDH2 expression was found to correlate with a significant enhancement to α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption. Vector-transfected cell lysates did not demonstrate this activity (Figure 2B). Although not nearly to the same degree as with the mutant enzyme, wild-type IDH2 overexpression also reproducibly enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption under these conditions.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Expression of R172K mutant IDH2 results in enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent consumption of NADPH Mutation of IDH2 R172K results in elevated 2HG levels  R172K mutant IDH2 lacks the guanidinium moiety in residue 172 that normally stabilizes β-carboxyl addition in the interconversion of α-ketoglutarate and isocitrate. Yet R172K mutant IDH2 exhibited enhanced α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption in cell lysates (Figure 2B). A similar enhancement of α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption has been reported for R132 mutations in IDH1, resulting in conversion of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). To determine if cells expressing IDH2 R172K shared this property, we expressed IDH2 wild-type or IDH2 R172K in cells. The accumulation of organic acids, including 2HG, both within cells and in culture medium of the transfectants was then assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after MTBSTFA derivatization of the organic acid pool. We observed a metabolite peak eluting at 32.5 min on GC-MS which was of minimal intensity in the culture medium of IDH2 wild-type expressing cells, but which in the medium of IDH2 R172K expressing cells had a markedly higher intensity approximating that of the glutamate signal (Figures 3A–3B). Mass spectra of this metabolite peak fit that predicted for MTBSTFA-derivatized 2HG, and the peak’s identity as 2HG was additionally confirmed by matching its mass spectra with that obtained by derivatization of commercial 2HG standards (Figure 3C). Similar results were obtained when the intracellular organic acid pool was analyzed. IDH2 R172K expressing cells were found to have an approximately 100-fold increase in the intracellular levels of 2HG compared with the levels detected in vector-transfected and IDH2 wild-type overexpressing cells (Figure 3D). Consistent with previous work, IDH1 R132H expressing cells analyzed in the same experiment had comparable accumulation of 2HG in both cells and in culture medium. 2HG accumulation was not observed in cells overexpressing IDH1 wild-type (data not shown).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Expression of R172K mutant IDH2 elevates 2HG levels within cells and in culture medium Mutant IDH2 produces the (R) enantiomer of 2HG  Cancer-associated mutants of IDH1 produce the (R) enantiomer of 2HG (Dang et al., 2009). To determine the chirality of the 2HG produced by mutant IDH2 and to compare it with that produced by R132H mutant IDH1, we used a two step derivatization method to distinguish the stereoisomers of 2HG by GC-MS: an esterification step with R-(-)-2-butanolic HCl, followed by acetylation of the 2-hydroxyl with acetic anhydride (Kamerling et al., 1981). Test of this method on commercial S(+)-2HG and R(-)-2HG standards demonstrated clear separation of the (S) and (R) enantiomers, and mass spectra of the metabolite peaks confirmed their identity as the O-acetylated di-(-)-2-butyl esters of 2HG (Figure S1A and S1B). By this method, we confirmed the chirality of the 2HG found in cells expressing either R132H mutant IDH1 or R172K mutant IDH2 corresponded exclusively to the (R) enantiomer (Figure S1C and S1D).  Leukemic cells bearing heterozygous R172K IDH2 mutations accumulate 2HG  To determine whether 2HG also accumulates in leukemic cells with either IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutations, we next analyzed the 2HG levels of selected leukemic samples. To date, every IDH1 R132H or IDH2 R172K mutant AML sample has exhibited evidence of 2HG accumulation, demonstrating a 2HG signal intensity by GC-MS analysis that is ≥ 30% of the intrasample glutamate signal. In contrast, control extracts have either had undetectable 2HG or a 2HG signal ≤ 1% of that for glutamate (n=13, p<0.001). Thus leukemic cells bearing either IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R172 mutation share the ability to accumulate 2HG in vivo with glioma cells exhibiting IDH1 R132 mutations.  IDH2 is critical for proliferating cells and contributes to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate in the mitochondria  A peculiar feature of the IDH-mutated cancers described to date is their lack of reduction to homozygosity. All tumors with IDH mutations retain one IDH wild-type allele. To address this issue we examined whether wild-type IDH1 and/or IDH2 might play a role in either cell survival or proliferation. Consistent with this possibility, we found that siRNA knockdown of either IDH1 or IDH2 can significantly reduce the proliferative capacity of a cancer cell line expressing both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 (Figure 4A).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Both IDH1 and IDH2 are critical for cell proliferation IDH1 is one of only three cytosolic enzymes that contribute to the NADPH production required for nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis during cell growth (DeBerardinis et al., 2007). In addition, IDH1 contributes to the maintenance of cytosolic redox state (Yan et al., 2009). Therefore, there are several reasons why IDH1 might be important for cell proliferation. However, unlike IDH1, IDH2 resides in the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria normally contain a high level of NADPH and readily interconvert NADH and NADPH (Rydstrom, 2006). Furthermore, it is IDH3, the NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, that is believed to be responsible for isocitrate conversion into α-ketoglutarate in the mitochondrial citric acid cycle (McCormack and Denton, 1979). This raised the possibility that wild-type IDH2 might be contributing to the ability of cancer cells to produce citrate from glutamine, as illustrated in Figure 4B. Such an enzymatic activity, though not ascribed to a particular IDH isoform, was characterized in early metabolic studies (Ochoa, 1948; Siebert et al., 1957). As shown in Figure 2B, when wild-type IDH2 was over-expressed in cells, it was found to consume NADPH in an α-ketoglutarate-dependent manner.  To test the possibility that wild-type IDH2 contributes to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate in the mitochondria of proliferating cells, we labeled cells with [13C-U]-L-glutamine (glutamine +5), and subsequently measured isotopic enrichment in citrate by GC-MS. Enrichment of citrate with five 13C atoms (citrate +5) can arise from the reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate +5 to isocitrate +5, while citrate enriched with four 13C atoms (citrate +4) can arise from oxidative metabolism of α-ketoglutarate through the traditional citric acid cycle (Figure 4B). Both forms of citrate production were reproducibly observed. To examine the role of IDH2 in citrate production, cells were treated with one of two independent IDH2 siRNAs. IDH2 siRNA treated cells displayed a significant reduction in levels of citrate +5, supporting a role for mitochondrial IDH2 in reductive carboxylation. Of note, no change in citrate +4 levels was observed, indicating that the effect of IDH2 knockdown was specific and not affecting other fundamental processes regulating the citric acid cycle (Figure 4C). Similar labeling patterns were observed in aconitate, an intermediate in the isomerization of isocitrate to citrate, with aconitate +5 also reduced following IDH2 knockdown, and aconitate +4 levels remaining unchanged (data not shown). In contrast, when cells were treated with one of two independent siRNAs against IDH3, there was a reproducible increase in citrate +5, while citrate +4 was unchanged (Figure 4D). These data support a role for IDH2 and not IDH3 in the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate by reductive carboxylation in the mitochondria, and provide a possible explanation for the lack of reduction to homozygosity for IDH2 mutations in cancer.  2HG can be used as a screening test for neomorphic IDH mutants  The above data suggest that the common feature of the IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R172 mutants is an ability to produce 2HG that can be measured directly in tumor samples. This suggested that screening for the presence of 2HG in tumor samples could be used as an assay to detect IDH mutations. To test this hypothesis, we obtained frozen samples of AML cells from 18 patients aged 50 years or older who presented with normal karyotype AML. All 18 samples were first screened for the intensity of their 2HG signal on GC-MS as a percentage of the intrasample glutamate signal (Table 1 and Figure 5). GC-MS analysis demonstrated that 9 of 18 samples had elevated 2HG. This fraction of samples was much higher than expected from the reported incidence of IDH1 mutation (Mardis et al., 2009). To correlate the results with mutation status, IDH1 and IDH2 were sequenced for all 18 samples in a blinded fashion. All samples displaying a signal ratio for 2HG/glutamate > 1% had either an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation. In contrast, none of the samples with a 2HG/glutamate signal ratio ≤ 1% had an IDH mutation (Table 1). Thus in this sample set, 2HG measurement was predictive of IDH mutation status.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Primary human AML samples with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations display marked elevations of 2HG Table 1 Table 1 Patient characteristics, metabolite analysis, and IDH status. The genetic analysis of these tumor samples revealed two neomorphic IDH mutations that produce 2HG. Among the IDH1 mutations, tumors with IDH1 R132C or IDH1 R132G accumulated 2HG. This result is not unexpected, as a number of mutations of R132 to other residues have also been shown to accumulate 2HG in glioma samples (Dang et al., 2009).  The other neomorphic allele was unexpected. All five of the IDH2 mutations producing 2HG in this sample set contained the same mutation, R140Q. As shown in Figure 1, both R140 in IDH2 and R100 in IDH1 are predicted to interact with the β-carboxyl of isocitrate. Additional modeling revealed that despite the reduced ability to bind isocitrate, the R140Q mutant IDH2 is predicted to maintain its ability to bind and orient α-ketoglutarate in the active site (Figure 6). This potentially explains the ability of cells with this neomorph to accumulate 2HG in vivo. As shown in Figure 5, samples containing IDH2 R140Q mutations were found to have accumulated 2HG to levels 10–100 fold greater than the highest levels detected in IDH wild-type samples.  Figure 6 Figure 6 Structural modeling of R140Q mutant IDH2 IDH2 mutations are more common than IDH1 mutations in AML  In the above sample set, just over half of the AML samples with 2HG accumulation had IDH2 mutations. This is in contrast to the data reported for gliomas in which less than 5% of IDH mutations were in IDH2 (Hartmann et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Initial studies of IDH genes in leukemia had failed to detect IDH2 mutations in R172 (Mardis et al., 2009). In the 18 cases we examined initially, all of the IDH2 mutations were IDH2 R140Q. However, this sample may have been biased by either the sample size and/or patient selection. We therefore analyzed 78 serial AML samples collected from a single center to determine the frequency of IDH1/2 mutation and investigated the co-association of IDH1/2 mutations with other genes known to contribute to AML pathogenesis (Table 2). While IDH1 mutations were found in 7.7% of samples in this analysis (6/78), twice as many mutations were detected in IDH2, at a frequency of 15.4% (12/78, p<0.05). Both the R140Q and R172K neomorphic alleles of IDH2 were identified. Of note, the IDH2 R140Q mutation was observed in more patients (7/78) than the R172K allele of IDH2 or R132 mutations in IDH1. None of the IDH2-mutated samples were found to also have somatic mutations in Flt-3, NPM1, or ASXL1. Furthermore, IDH2 and IDH1 mutations were only observed in normal karyotype AML patients, whereas known cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in 7/51 samples without IDH1/2 mutations (13.7%; all IDH mutants vs. IDH wild-type, p<0.05). We also examined whether IDH1 and/or IDH2 mutation status had any effect on the overall survival of this set of patients. As was previously reported (Mardis et al., 2009), mutations in IDH1 did not appear to affect overall survival (p=0.37, Figure S2A). However, we noted a trend towards improved survival in patients who presented with IDH2 mutations (p=0.08, Figure S2B).  Table 2 Table 2 Clinical and genetic parameters of IDH1/2 wild-type and mutant AML samples. Go to: DISCUSSION Neomorphic enzymatic activity to produce 2HG is the shared feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations  Mutations in the cytosolic enzyme IDH1 have been reported in a high percentage of gliomas and a significant subset of AML patients (Mardis et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2009). Recently, IDH1 mutations of R132 were associated with the accumulation of the metabolite 2HG in glial tumor samples (Dang et al., 2009). The discovery of an elderly AML patient with an IDH2 R172 mutation, the analogous residue to IDH1 R132, prompted us to test whether this IDH2 mutation also resulted in a gain-of-function ability to catalyze the conversion of α-ketoglutarate to 2HG. In this study of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in AML, we have demonstrated that 2HG production is a common feature of the spontaneous mutations in these two IDH homologs. By showing that 2HG production can result from mutation at any of three residues which normally stabilize the β-carboxyl of isocitrate, IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172, and IDH2 R140, we demonstrate that it is the truncated, non-carboxylating, reduction of α-ketoglutarate to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarate that is the common feature linking all cancer-associated IDH mutations.  2HG as a screening and diagnostic marker  With our demonstration that 2HG production is the common feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, the measurement of 2HG levels allowed us to identify additional IDH mutations in AML patients. This is exemplified in this study by the use of 2HG screening to identify two distinct mutations in IDH2, R140Q and R172K, that produce 2HG. These data demonstrate that at least IDH2 neomorphic mutations are not limited to a single arginine residue. Therefore, additional IDH1 and IDH2 neomorphic alleles may still remain to be found in gliomas, hematopoietic malignancies, and in other cancers. The 2HG levels in cancers with IDH mutations are consistently 10–100 fold elevated over levels found in samples lacking mutations of IDH1 or IDH2. Inborn errors of metabolism which lead to 2HG elevation are exceptionally rare and have devastating developmental consequences (Kolker et al., 2002a). Tumors displaying elevated 2HG are unlikely to be false positives. Thus, 2HG appears to be an important marker of IDH1/2-mutated neoplasms. Given the quantities of 2HG that accumulate in the culture medium of cells expressing IDH mutant enzymes, 2HG may even be detectable in the peripheral blood of leukemia patients with IDH mutations at the time of presentation. We are currently testing the potential of such a screening and diagnostic approach.  Maintaining at least one IDH1 and IDH2 wild-type allele may be essential for transformed cells  2HG production is a shared feature of heterozygous mutations in either cytosolic IDH1 or mitochondrial IDH2. There is a marked difference in the enzymatic rate of isocitrate-dependent NADPH production by the wild-type proteins and α-ketoglutarate-dependent NADPH consumption by both IDH1 and IDH2 mutants (Figure 2 and Dang et al., 2009). Nevertheless, both mutant proteins lead to an over 100-fold increase in tumor 2HG accumulation. In addition, it appears that both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 can play positive and non-redundant roles in cell proliferation. The roles of IDH1 and IDH2 in supporting cell proliferation are likely to be different. IDH1 contributes to cytosolic NADPH production. In the case of IDH1 mutant proteins, it has been reported that a local supply of NADPH and α-ketoglutarate is required to drive 2HG production (Dang et al., 2009). In the context of a wild-type/mutant IDH1 heterodimer, the required substrates for the mutant’s neomorphic activity are most readily provided by the wild-type subunit’s normal activity on NADP+ and isocitrate. However, for the neomorphic activity of mitochondrial IDH2 mutants, the requirement for local generation of substrate is unlikely to be absolute. Mitochondria typically have a high NADPH/NADP+ ratio, supported in part by the ability to interconvert NADPH and NADH in the matrix (Rydstrom, 2006). In addition, mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate is maintained at high levels by a variety of anaplerotic substrates. While the exact role of wild-type IDH2 in supporting cell growth will require further investigation, this requirement correlates with the ability of IDH2 to contribute to the conversion of α-ketoglutarate into citrate via a pathway of reductive carboxylation in the mitochondria of proliferating cells.  2HG as an onco-metabolite  Although 2HG has been proposed to increase ROS levels in patients with inborn errors of 2HG metabolism (Kolker et al., 2002b; Latini et al., 2003), to date we have no evidence that the metabolite acts as a mutagen. This is consistent with data presented here that IDH1-mutated and IDH2-mutated AML samples typically do not harbor other known mutations associated with AML, as well as a prior report that IDH-mutated gliomas often lack other mutations that are commonly acquired early in glioma pathogenesis (Yan et al., 2009). In an AML case with an IDH1 mutation that was sequenced in its entirety (Mardis et al., 2009), there were a relatively small total number of somatic, non-synonymous mutations. However, a possibility by which 2HG might contribute to tumorigenesis emerges from consideration of the tumor subtypes in which IDH mutations are found with high frequency: gliomas with mixed astrocytic and oligodendroglial features, and acute myeloid leukemias. In both cases, proliferation of a relatively undifferentiated cell population is central to the disease, and pathogenesis is marked by a block to differentiation rather than simply by an increase in proliferative rate. Thus, one may speculate that 2HG’s effect in the tumor and its microenvironment is to block cellular differentiation. Whether cells carrying a mutant IDH transgene exhibit a block to differentiation in vivo will need to be examined. The production of lineage-specific mutant IDH transgenic animals or hematopoetic bone marrow reconstitution following retroviral introduction of a mutant IDH will allow future studies to test this hypothesis.  Whether 2HG fits into the broad class of mutagens or plays a distinct role in carcinogenesis remains to be determined. For now, it appears to represent a highly correlative maker for an emerging class of somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes. Importantly, these mutations appear to define a significant subset of CNS tumors and leukemias. The identification of frequent IDH2 mutations in AML increases the significance of this family of mutations in understanding the pathogenesis of AML. Taken together, IDH mutations occur in 23% of samples analyzed here. All IDH mutations reported to date share the neomorphic ability to produce high levels of tumor 2HG. Future studies are required to understand the role of 2HG in leukemic transformation and to elucidate the role of IDH1/IDH2 in the pathogenesis of AML.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Patient selection and statistical analysis  Patient samples were obtained from either the Stem Cell and Xenotransplantation Core Facility of the University of Pennsylvania or from the tissue collections of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute. Approval was obtained from the institutional review boards at the University of Pennsylvania (IRB protocol 703185) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute (IRB protocols 95–091 and 06–107), and informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All samples were collected after de-identification for these studies. For assessing clinical and genetic parameters of IDH1/2 wild-type and mutant AML, 78 serial samples from AML patients referred for molecular testing at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were examined. For 2HG assays, patient samples were obtained from the Stem Cell and Xenotransplantation Core Facility of the University of Pennsylvania. The initial 18 samples were selected from de-identified AML patients aged 50 years or older at diagnosis with lesions determined to have normal cytogenetic status. Cells used for these assays were prepared by Ficoll separation of mononuclear cells (MNCs) from peripheral blood or bone marrow. MNCs were frozen as viable cells in 10% DMSO. Student’s t test and Chi-square analysis were used to analyze data. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.  Sequence Analysis of IDH1 and IDH2  Genomic DNA was extracted from bone marrow mononuclear cells or from sorted leukemic cells; for samples with less than 70% blasts flow cytometric sorting (FACSAria) was used to isolate blast cells according to leukemic blast immunophenotype before DNA isolation. High-throughput DNA sequence analysis was used to screen for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. All DNA samples were whole genome amplified using Ø29 polymerase and mutations were validated on unamplified DNA to ensure all mutations were present in the diagnostic sample. Sequencing of IDH1 used primers which cover amino acid residues 41–138 (sense, 5’-TGTGTTGAGATGGACGCCTA-3’; antisense, 5’-GGTGTACTCAGAGCCTTCGC-3’). Sequencing of IDH2 used primers which cover amino acid residues 125–226 (sense, 5’-CTGCCTCTTTGTGGCCTAAG-3’; antisense, 5’-ATTCTGGTTGAAAGATGGCG-3’). Sequence analysis was performed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College PA) and all mutations were validated by repeat PCR and sequencing on unamplified DNA from the archival sample.  Structural modeling  Human IDH2 has 97% homology with pig IDH2, and none of the 13 residues that are different (out of 418 total, excluding the N-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence) are found in the active site. A PDB structure of pig IDH2 is available, with isocitrate in the active site (1LWD) (Ceccarelli et al., 2002). Based on the highly homologous pig structure, conservative structural models of human IDH2 were built with the CHARMM molecular mechanics package using the CHARMM27 force field. To model wild-type IDH2 with isocitrate, the 13 residues of 1LWD differing between pig and human were first changed to the human sequence. The side chains were then rebuilt, hydrogen atoms added to all residues, the substrate, active site Mn2+ ions, and conserved residues were restrained, and the structure minimized allowing only the changed residues to relax. For the α-ketoglutarate complexes, the substrate conformation/pose was first modeled on isocitrate by removing the β-carboxyl group and replacing it with a hydrogen. The wild-type IDH2-α-ketoglutarate complex was then minimized allowing only the active site residues (as defined in entry 1LWD) and substrate to relax. The R140Q mutant IDH2-α-ketoglutarate complex was subsequently modeled by changing arginine 140 to glutamine, and rebuilding the side chain. The structure was then minimized in two stages. First the mutated residue was allowed to relax, followed by a second relaxation of the active site residues, Mn2+, and substrate. All modeling images were generated using PyMOL Viewer (DeLano, 2002).  Constructing IDH1 and IDH2 mutants  The cDNA clone of human IDH2 (BC009244) was purchased from Invitrogen in pOTB7. Human IDH1 (BC012846.1) was purchased from ATCC in pCMV-Sport6. Standard site-directed mutagenesis techniques were used to generate IDH2 R172K by introducing a g515a change in the IDH2 open reading frame (ORF). IDH1 R132H was made by introducing a g395a base pair change in the IDH1 ORF. Wild-type and mutant sequences were then subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and confirmed by direct sequencing before expression in mammalian cells.  Cell culture, transfection, and metabolic labeling  293T cells and Bcl-xL-transfected SF188 cells (SF188) were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (CellGro). For expression of wild-type and mutant IDH1 and IDH2, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For IDH siRNA experiments, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMax, with oligonucleotides obtained from Sigma-Proligo. For metabolic labeling experiments, cells were cultured in glutamine-free DMEM supplemented with 4 mM [13C-U]-L-glutamine (Cambridge Isotope) for the 3h prior to metabolite extraction.  Cell lysate based enzyme assays  For IDH2 enzymatic assays, cells were lysed 48 h following transfection, using mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma). Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000g at 4 °C. Supernatants were then collected and normalized for total protein concentration. To measure IDH oxidative activity, 0.3 µg of lysate protein was added to 200 µl of an assay solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1.3 mM MnCl2, 0.33 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM β-NADP+, and 0.1 mM D-(+)-threo-isocitrate. The increase in 340 nm absorbance (OD340) as a measure of NADPH production was measured every 20 s for 30 min on a SpectraMax 190 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Data are plotted as the mean activity of 3 replicates per lysate averaged among 5 time points centered at every 5 minutes. To measure IDH reductive activity, 3 µg of lysate protein was added to 200 µl of an assay solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.3 mM MnCl2, 0.01 mM β-NADPH, and 0.5 mM α-ketoglutarate. NADPH consumption was measured as the decrease in OD340, with 3 replicates per lysate. For all experiments, OD340 changes in assay buffer lacking lysate protein were measured and subsequently subtracted from the OD340 changes measured in lysate replicates to arrive at final values.  Western blot  To measure IDH2 levels in cell lysates used for enzymatic assays, aliquots of the same lysates used in activity measurements were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with IDH2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam, ab55271), and then detected with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (GE Healthcare, NA931V). For assessing IDH knockdown in siRNA experiments, cells treated in parallel with those used for labeling or proliferative studies were lysed 48 h following transfection in standard RIPA buffer (1% NaDOC, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01 M Tris pH 8.0, 0.14 M NaCl), and then probed with IDH2 antibody as above, IDH1 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc49996), or IDH3A rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, ab58641). Actin antibody (Santa Cruz, sc1616) was also used to assess equal protein loading of Western blots.  Metabolite extraction  Cellular organic acids were extracted as previously described (Bennett et al., 2008). Briefly, after gentle removal of culture medium from proliferating cells, or freezing medium from frozen viable AML samples, cells were rapidly quenched with 80% methanol, chilled to −80°C, and then incubated at −80°C for 15 min. Extracts were subsequently transferred and centrifuged at 14,000g for 20 min. at 4°C. The organic acid pool in the supernatant was further purified by drying under nitrogen gas, redissolving in deionized water, and then elution from an AG-1 ×8 100–200 anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad) in 3 N HCl after washing with five column volumes. For media analysis, culture medium from transfected cells 24–48 h following transfection was collected and diluted five-fold with methanol. After centrifugation at 14,000g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated protein, supernatants were dried under nitrogen gas, and organic acids were purified as described above.  Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis  After drying the HCl eluate, samples were redissolved in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA; Regis) and heated for 1 h at 60°C to derivatize prior to GC-MS analysis. Samples were injected into an Agilent 7890A GC with an HP-5MS capillary column, connected to an Agilent 5975C Mass selective detector operating in splitless mode using electron impact ionization with ionizing voltage of −70 eV and electron multiplier set to 1060 V. GC temperature was started at 100 °C for 3 min, ramped to 230 °C at 4 °C/min and held for 4 min, then ramped to 300 °C and held for 5 min. Mass range of 50–500 amu was recorded at 2.71 scans/sec. Isotopic enrichment in citric acid was monitored using ions at m/e− 463 and 464 for citrate +4 and citrate +5 (containing 4 and 5 13C-enriched atoms, respectively), formed through loss of a t-butyl (−57 amu) and t-butyldimethylsilanol (−132 amu) from the molecular ion tetra-TBDMS-citric acid (648 amu). Isotopomer distributions were simultaneously corrected for naturally occurring heavy isotopes of all elements in each mass fragment using a correction matrix as previously described (Weckwerth, 2007). Identification of the 2HG metabolite peak was confirmed using standards obtained from Sigma. 2HG and glutamate signal intensities were quantified by integration of peak areas.  Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)  Organic acids from cellular extracts were purified as described above, followed by evaporation to dryness under nitrogen. After redissolving samples in deionized water, citrate was detected on two different LC-MS approaches, both of which gave comparable results. In both cases, LC separation was by reversed phase chromatography using tributylamine as an ion pairing agent (Lu et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2007) with ionization by negative electrospray at 23 kV. The first MS approach used a Thermo Discovery Max triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring mode, with citrate quantified using the reaction 191 → 87 at 20 eV. Additional reactions for every possible labeled form of citrate were also monitored using variations of the same transition. Reactions used to monitor other TCA components have been described previously (Bajad et al., 2006). The second MS approach used a Thermo Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer operated at 100,000 mass resolving power, with citrate and its isotope-labeled forms quantified based on extracted ion chromatograms at their exact masses.  SIGNIFICANCE  Most cancer-associated enzyme mutations result in either catalytic inactivation or constitutive activation. Here we report that the common feature of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations observed in AML and glioma is the acquisition of an enzymatic activity not shared by either wild-type enzyme. The product of this neomorphic enzyme activity can be readily detected in tumor samples and we show that tumor metabolite analysis can identify patients with tumor-associated IDH mutations. Using this method, we discovered a 2HG-producing IDH2 mutation, IDH2 R140Q, that was present in 9% of serial AML samples. Overall, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were observed in over 23% of AML patients.  HIGHLIGHTS  All IDH mutations reported in cancer share a common neomorphic enzymatic activity. Both wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 are required for cell proliferation. IDH2 R140Q mutations occur in 9% of AML cases. Overall, IDH2 mutations appear more common than IDH1 mutations in AML.  
1825||Mutational hotspots indicate selective pressure across a population of tumor samples, but their prevalence within and across cancer types is incompletely characterized. An approach to detect significantly mutated residues, rather than methods that identify recurrently mutated genes, may uncover new biologically and therapeutically relevant driver mutations. Here we developed a statistical algorithm to identify recurrently mutated residues in tumour samples. We applied the algorithm to 11,119 human tumors, spanning 41 cancer types, and identified 470 hotspot somatic substitutions in 275 genes. We find that half of all human tumors possess one or more mutational hotspots with widespread lineage-, position-, and mutant allele-specific differences, many of which are likely functional. In total, 243 hotspots were novel and appeared to affect a broad spectrum of molecular function, including hotspots at paralogous residues of Ras-related small GTPases RAC1 and RRAS2. Redefining hotspots at mutant amino acid resolution will help elucidate the allele-specific differences in their function and could have important therapeutic implications.  Among the best-studied therapeutic targets in human cancers are proteins encoded by genes with tumor-specific mutational hotspots, such as KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, KIT, and EGFR. The acquisition of somatic mutations is one of the major mechanisms responsible for the dysregulation of proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis that is required for oncogenesis. Comprehensive genomic characterization of tumors has produced significant insights into the somatic aberrations that define individual cancer types1,2, broadening our understanding of the dysfunctional molecular pathways that govern tumor initiation, progression, and maintenance. These data have spurred the development of computational algorithms to identify cancer driver genes, defined as those in which molecular abnormalities lead to a fitness advantage for the affected cancer cells (Methods).  These computational approaches develop either gene-level statistical models that exploit different mutational patterns3–6 to identify significantly mutated genes or use weight-of-evidence-based methods1,7 that are heuristic and ratiometric in approach. Together, these methods focus on identifying cancer genes from a multitude of diverse molecular abnormalities affecting the gene. However, not all genomic alterations in cancer genes are driver alterations. Furthermore, not all driver alterations in a cancer gene have the same functional impact, and are therefore likely to have varying clinical significance. The potentially diverse functional effects of different lesions in the same gene are not captured and reported by gene-level models, but are rather assumed to be equivalent. However, emerging data indicate that different hotspot mutations in the same cancer gene can be functionally distinct in vitro and in vivo and display different clinical phenotypes and drug sensitivity8–11. Moreover, it is unknown how widespread such hotspot-specific functional differences may be.  To date, studies of hotspot mutations in cancer have been limited to within individual tumor types12–14 or have focused on individual cancer genes across tumor types15. A systematic population-scale, cross-cancer, genome-wide analysis of mutational hotspots has not been performed and the extent to which mutant allele and lineage-specific effects exist remains unknown. As broad-based clinical sequencing has begun to inform the care of individual cancer patients, this would begin to address one of the greatest challenges in the practice of genomically driven cancer medicine: interpreting the biological and clinical significance of mutations in even presumed actionable cancer genes as they arise in oncology clinics.  To address this challenge, we develop a computational algorithm to identify driver mutations, rather than driver genes. We assembled and rigorously curated a large repository of cancer genome data consisting of the sequenced tumor exomes and whole genomes of 11,119 human tumors representing 41 tumor types. We developed a biologically aware, statistically principled computational model by combining observed biological phenomena such as nucleotide mutability and varying gene-specific mutation rates into coefficients that we incorporate into binomial statistics. From this, we systematically identify individual recurrent mutations and associate these with related temporal and transcriptional data to investigate lineage-specific variation in mutations, and identify novel hotspots with likely clinical implications.  Go to: Results Landscape of hotspots mutations in primary human cancer  We collected the mutational data from the sequenced exomes and genomes of 11,119 human tumors in 41 tumor types (Supplementary Table 1). These originate from diverse sources including large international consortia and various published studies (Methods). This cohort represents a broad range of primary human malignancies with three or more tumor types in each of nine major organ systems (Fig. 1a). The repository consists of 2,007,694 somatic substitutions in protein-coding regions with a median of 57 mutations (25 and 125 mutations; 25th and 75th percentile respectively) per tumor-normal pair with significant variability in mutation rates among and between tumors and types4,16. In total, 19,223 human genes harbor at least one somatic mutation in this dataset.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Mutational data and hotspot detection Here, we define a mutational hotspot as an amino acid position in a protein-coding gene that is mutated (by substitutions) more frequently than would be expected in the absence of selection (Methods). In this analysis, we focus exclusively on individual substitutions rather than other somatic abnormalities such as translocations, amplifications, deletions, or epigenetic modifications. To identify mutational hotspots, including low-incidence mutations, we developed a binomial statistical model that incorporates several aspects of underlying mutational processes including nucleotide context mutability, gene-specific mutation rates, and major expected patterns of hotspot mutation emergence (Supplementary Fig. 1a and 2, Supplementary Code; Methods). As considerable variability exists in the methods and standards for mutation calling used by individual studies and centers, we also developed several evidence-based criteria for eliminating probable false positive hotspots (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 1b). In total, we identified 470 statistically significant hotspots (q-value < 0.01) affecting 275 protein-coding genes (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Overall, more than half of all hotspots were determined to be novel (Fig. 1b, Table 1, Supplementary Table 2, and Methods) and 54.8% of all tumors assessed here possessed one or more hotspot mutations.  Table 1 Table 1 Select new hotspots in cancer genes Most affected genes possessed only a single hotspot (Supplementary Fig. 3a). A subset of genes, however, possessed many hotspots of varying frequency. In total, 49 genes possessed two or more hotspots (Fig. 1c), with many of these also arising in the greatest number of tumor types (Supplementary Fig. 3b). TP53 R248 was the most disseminated hotspot, observed in 25 tumor types. Among a subset of even well characterized oncogenes, a pattern of both known and novel hotspots emerge (Fig. 1d). Moreover, the number of observed mutant amino acids at a given hotspot generally increases with its mutational frequency across tumors types (Supplementary Fig. 3c), though 35% (n=164) of hotspots mutate to only a single variant amino acid. In most genes, hotspots bear only a fraction of the total mutational burden across the gene, whereas in a subset of cancer genes, the dominant mutational hotspot constitutes the vast majority of mutations independent of total mutational burden (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3d). Overall, we identified considerable variability in the patterns of mRNA expression of individual hotspots in even canonical oncogenes (Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating that levels of expression are often not correlated with the biologic significance of known activating mutations.  The patterns by which some hotspots emerge support new clinical paradigms for testing targeted agents. Some hotspots that dominate the mutational landscape in one or a few cancer types also arise as uncommon subsets of many others. For instance, IDH1 R132 is most common in low-grade gliomas, glioblastomas, acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), and cutaneous melanomas; but it is also present in 1 to 6 tumors in each of 11 additional cancer types. AKT1 E17K arises in greatest numbers in breast cancer, but also in 1 to 3 tumors of 10 additional cancer types. The distribution of CREBBP R1446 mutations is qualitatively different. They were originally identified in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemias17, but in this cohort of mostly primary disease, we find that they arise in only a small minority (1–3; 0.17–1.7%) of many (11) cancer types. Such patterns reaffirm the value of basket study designs that test mutant-specific inhibitors in early phase clinical trials, where enrollment is based on specific mutations in patients instead of tissue of origin.  A lineage map of all hotspots in genes with at least one common hotspot (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5) indicates most hotspots are defined more by the tissue types rather than the organ systems in which they arise. Of all hotspots, 81% arise in two or more tumor types, suggesting that many hotspot mutations may confer a growth advantage across diverse lineages. Indeed, of hotspots present in multiple tumor types, only 7.6% (n = 36) are confined to a single organ system (Table 2). Thus, hotspot mutations that arise in a single tumor type may reflect organ-specific growth advantages but they represent only a small minority of all hotspot mutations in cancer. Likewise, a subset of hotspots arises in a cell-type specific manner. Twenty-seven hotspots (5.7%) were more frequently mutated in tumors of a squamous cell lineage (Supplementary Fig. 6), the most significant of which were MAPK1 E322 and EP300 D1399 (q-value = 6×10−13 and 1×10−11 respectively, χ2) and may potentially confer a squamous cell-type specific growth advantage.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Lineage landscape of hotspot mutations Table 2 Table 2 Organ system-specific hotspots Overall, the presence, type, and frequency of hotspots by tumor type vary widely (Fig. 2b). In some tumor types, a large proportion of tumors possess one or more hotspot mutations including a significant fraction of tumors with a hotspot in a candidate oncogene (Fig. 2b, top). Conversely, other tumor types never or rarely possess a tumor defined by a hotspot identified here. Some of these differences are certainly attributable to the fact that hotspots are only one of many possible driver genomic aberrations, including specific gene fusions or focal amplifications and deletions. These other aberrations may define tumors of a given type, but they are not mutually exclusive with hotspots in many cancers. Other differences could not, alone, be explained by the overall mutational burden in these tumor types. For instance, uterine carcinosarcomas and prostate cancers have a similar mutation rate while there is 3-fold greater frequency of hotspot-bearing tumors among the former. Likewise, while papillary thyroid and high-grade pontine gliomas have mutations rates similar to nasopharyngeal tumors and neuroblastomas, the former far more commonly bear hotspot mutations (Fig. 2b).  Unconventional hotspots  In addition to missense mutations, we identified a variety of unconventional hotspot mutations with varied impact. Among these were 13 splice site hotspots. For each of these hotspots, an associated transcript abnormality was identified from RNA sequencing of affected tumors (exon skipping, intron retention, in-frame deletions; Supplementary Fig. 7a), including two previously characterized in-frame activating mutations (MET D1010_splice and PIK3R1 M582_splice, both exon 14 skipping events). We also identified 70 hotspots in 34 genes for which a nonsense mutation was among a diversity of changes at the affected residue, including 28 hotspots in which only a nonsense mutation was present (Supplementary Fig. 7b). While nonsense mutations scattered throughout a gene may reflect a pattern of loss-of-function consistent with tumor suppressor activity, a nonsense hotspot would appear to indicate the selection for the selective truncation of specific functional domains. Such events are consistent with the loss of some functions and the retention of others, as has been observed previously in genes such as PIK3R1, NOTCH1, and MET18,19. These hotspots aside, there was a depletion of nonsense mutations in hotspots in constitutively essential genes (p-value<10−16, those genes predicted or experimentally verified to be essential across all cell and tissue types and developmental states20). Otherwise, the specific impact of nonsense hotspots is generally unknown and belies the disseminated pattern of truncating mutations in likely or proven tumor suppressors (Supplementary Fig. 7c).  Lineage diversity and mutant allele-specificity  The majority of hotspot mutations arose in diverse tumor types and organ systems, yet widespread differences exist among individual residues and mutant amino acids in hotspots, genes, and tumor types (Fig. 3a). Examining the spectrum of KRAS mutations, which includes the most frequently mutated hotspot overall in our study (KRAS G12; n=736 mutant tumors, Fig. 1d and and2a),2a), clarified patterns only incidentally observed in the past. We found that gastric cancers were more similar to multiple myeloma in the preponderance of non-G12 mutations compared to endometrial, lung, colorectal, and pancreas tumors (p-value = 5.3×10−18, Supplementary Table 4). Only colorectal tumors had KRAS A146 mutations whereas pancreas tumors lacked G13 mutations (p-values = 4×10−7 and 2.8×10−15 respectively). Many of these lineage-specific patterns were present at finer resolution as well. Among KRAS G12 mutations, the abundance of G12C mutations are highest in lung adenocarcinomas (p-value = 4×10−42), an event that may be associated with prognostic differences compared with non-G12C KRAS mutations21–23. Such mutant amino acid specificity was also apparent in pancreas tumors, where KRAS G12R was more common than in any other tumor type (21% versus between 0 and 2.6%; χ2 p-value = 4.8×10−19). Gastric cancers, on the other hand, had the fewest G12V mutations among all KRAS G12-mutant tumor types, but the highest proportion of G12S (p-value = 0.007, Fig. 3b). There is a different balance among hotspots in the other Ras genes. While papillary thyroid cancers nearly exclusively possessed codon Q61 mutations in HRAS and NRAS (p-value = 4×10−7), there was a higher prevalence of G12 and 13 codon mutations in these genes in AMLs, colorectal, bladder, and head and neck cancers, which together share few mutational processes in common (p-value = 4×10−10, Fig. 3a).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Lineage diversity and mutant allele specificity Similar differences emerged in other driver cancer genes with multiple hotspots. V600E mutations describe nearly all BRAF hotspot mutations in melanoma, papillary thyroid, and colorectal carcinomas, whereas multiple myelomas are similar to lung adenocarcinoma in which non-V600E hotspots predominate (p-value = 1.9×-10−32). The balance between extracellular and kinase domain mutations in EGFR between brain tumors and lung adenocarcinoma (p-value = 3.3×10−12) respectively have been documented previously and affect their biological impact and the efficacy of genotype-directed therapy10. ERBB2 followed a similar pattern, where extracellular domain mutations typified by S310F are far more common than are kinase domain mutations in bladder cancers compared to breast cancers (p-value = 0.006, Fig. 3a). Another notable gene was PIK3CA. While bladder and cervical cancers are similar in their distribution of PIK3CA hotspot mutations, they vary significantly from breast cancers in the overall balance of helical to kinase domain mutations, possessing far fewer H1047R mutations among PIK3CA-mutated cases (p-value = 4.8×10−19). Endometrial and colorectal cancers also have a similar pattern of PIK3CA hotspots, but both have a higher prevalence of R88Q mutations than any other tumor type (p-value = 1.3×10−11, Fig. 3a). Such patterns extend beyond essential MAPK or PI3K signaling components, such as with SF3B1 K700 mutations that predominate in breast cancers and chronic lymphocytic leukemias whereas melanomas more frequently possess R625 mutations (p-value = 0.0001). Finally, mutant amino acid specificity was not limited to hotspots in Ras genes. The IDH1 R132H hotspot mutation predominated in multiple brain tumor types, but cysteine was the most common IDH1 R132 mutant amino acid in melanoma, which is unlikely to be exclusively related to UV light exposure, as this is also true in AMLs that lack a UV-driven etiology (p-value = 3.9×10−21). Together, these results indicate that substantial mutant amino acid specificity exists among hotspot mutations across highly diverse tumor lineages. Two related conclusions may be drawn from these data. First, different hotspots in the same gene may possess in many cases different function, much of which may be lineage-dependent, while not excluding the possibility that some may still arise as a function of differing underlying mutational mechanisms. Second, that perhaps different mutant amino acids within the same hotspot can be functionally different, support for which is growing8,11.  Timing of individual hotspots  We next sought to determine if hotspot mutations, many of which are likely driver mutations and in some cases may serve as the initiating lesion, typically arise earlier than do non-recurrent mutations in the same genes and are therefore more often clonal. Overall, mutations at hotspot residues more often resided in a greater fraction of tumor cells (see Methods) and were therefore earlier arising (presumptive clonal), than were non-hotspot mutations in the same genes (Fig. 3c). So, while prior work has shown that driver genes in lung adenocarcinomas were enriched for clonal mutations24, we found that this was true of hotspot mutations across a broad class of cancer genes and tumor types. However, there was considerable variability among hotspots. While colorectal and endometrial cancers have a similar pattern of PIK3CA hotspot mutations (Fig. 3a) and share hypermutated subtypes of tumors driven by MSI and POLE exonuclease domain mutations25,26, colorectal tumors were unique in the clonality of the E545 and H1047 mutations. The majority of PIK3CA E545 helical domain mutations in colorectal cancers were subclonal, whereas H1047 kinase domain mutations were clonal, a difference that was not apparent in endometrial tumors, in which both are early clonal mutations (Fig. 3d). This may be a function of the pattern of oncogenic co-mutation in these tumors as PIK3CA E545, but not H1047, mutations were significantly associated with KRAS mutations in these colorectal cancers (χ2 p-value = 0.0004) and in previous cohorts27. Overall, these differences in the molecular timing of specific hotspots augurs potentially important differences in their function in tumor initiation versus progression that requires further study.  Population-level hotspots in the long tail  Consistent with the so-called long tail of the frequency distribution of somatically mutated genes across cancer2, we found that 85% of all hotspots identified here were mutated in less than 5% of tumors of all cancer types in which they were found (Fig. 4a). Such findings have led to calls for sequencing up to many thousands of additional specimens from every tumor type28. However, many hotspots present at low frequency across cancers are not mutated commonly or significantly in even a single cancer type. Indeed, 23% of all hotspots identified here were present in only one or two samples in the tumor types in which it was observed. This included 19 hotspots arising in only one sample of each affected cancer type such as U2AF1 I24, MYC T58, the hyperactivating MTOR I250029, PIK3CB D1067, EP300 H1451, and ERBB3 M60. Therefore, many driver mutations (rather than genes) may never be found mutated at even the minimal frequencies (2–3%) proposed by previous studies as a goal in each cancer type. Conversely, population-level analysis, rather than by individual cancer type or organ system, allows identification of hotspots that arise as even private mutations in rare malignancies, for which additional broad-scale sequencing is most challenging. While rare, such recurrent alleles are evidence of selection and may be associated with specific phenotypes, such as exceptional responses30,31, de novo resistance to cancer therapy, or reveal specific facets of pathway biology. Consequently, we found that notable long-tail hotspots affect a broad spectrum of abnormal molecular function including macromolecular transport and transcriptional regulation (Table 1, Supplementary Note, and Supplementary Fig. 8), as well as essential components of key signaling pathways.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Candidate Ras-related small GTPase driver mutations in the long tail Long-tail hotspots in Ras superfamily members  Mutations in the Ras family of small GTPases occur widely in human cancers. As expected, these were among the most significant hotspots detected here (Supplementary Table 2), affecting 1,335 tumors (12% of all cases). Whereas G12, G13, and Q61 codon hotspots predominate in KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS, albeit at varying frequencies in different tumor types (Fig. 2a and and3a),3a), we also identified GQ60GK, K117, and A146 hotspots in KRAS. Both K117 and A146 are known activating hotspots in the long tail, but we also identified a previously occult GQ60GK dinucleotide substitution (q-value = 2.3×10−6) in 11 tumors. This dinucleotide substitution results in a Q61K mutation accompanied by a G60 synonymous mutation that are present in cis (in concomitant RNA sequencing, Supplementary Fig. 9). Although Q>K mutations at codon 61 can result from 3’G>T single-nucleotide mutations in KRAS, 100% of these tumors harbored the dinucleotide substitution, a rare spontaneous event in human genomes. Overall, the distribution of codon 61 mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS are very different, with Q>K mutations occurring significantly less frequently in KRAS (p-value=0.016; Fig. 4b). GA>TT mutations were the most common dinucleotide substitution producing GQ60GK (Fig. 4c) and converts the ACC codon at KRAS G60 to TCC, which is the sequence of the G60 codon in NRAS, in which Q61K mutations are far more common and arise nearly exclusively from single-nucleotide mutations. It remains to be determined whether KRAS GQ60GK is therefore driven by a pattern of codon usage at the −1 position. Notably, only one tumor had evidence of a non-KRAS GQ60GK mutation, an NRAS-mutant cutaneous melanoma (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 5).  We next explored whether KRAS GQ60GK may serve as a driver of Ras pathway activity as do conventional KRAS hotspots. GQ60GK is indeed present in diverse tumor types that all have well-established Ras-driven subsets (Supplementary Table 5). Reasoning that if GQ60GK were a passenger mutation in Ras-driven tumors, alternative MAPK activating mutations may be present in these tumors. Instead, we found that in every GQ60GK-mutant sample where another putative driver of MAPK signaling was present, that lesion was either 1) subclonal, defining a different clone than did GQ60GK; 2) low activity; or 3) a passenger mutation (Supplementary Table 5). Also, despite the frequency of GA>TT, there was no evidence that a common underlying mutational process or exogenous mutagen was the source of GQ60GK. There was no evidence of UV light exposure in the clinical histories or nucleotide contexts of most affected cases, only one of which was a cutaneous melanoma. Moreover, GQ60GK arose in both hypermutated (MSI-H colon lacking BRAF V600E) and non-hypermutated tumors. Finally, rare G60 missense mutations were evident in K- and HRAS in this dataset and in the literature (Supplementary Table 5)32. So, while we cannot exclude the possibility that the GQ60GK dinucleotide substitution is simply an alternative mechanism to achieve Q61K, the accompanying KRAS-specific G60 synonymous mutation may potentiate a different class of Q61-mutant tumors or cause signaling differences among Q61K-mutant tumors between K-N- or HRAS. Although further studies will need to explore the molecular properties of KRAS GQ60GK, this allele represents the most common dinucleotide substitution spanning two codons in human cancer and a mutation more common than other known hotspots in KRAS.  Novel long-tail hotspots were also identified in two other genes that encode members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. RAC1, in which we identified two hotspots, is a Rho subfamily member that plays a vital role in various cellular functions. RAC1 P29S is an oncogenic hotspot in melanomas12,33 that we also identified in head and neck and endometrial cancers (Fig. 4d). This mutation can confer resistance to RAF inhibitor treatment in vitro34, and may underlie early resistance in patients35. We also identified a novel RAC1 A159V hotspot present in 10 tumors (q-value = 2.27×10−6; Fig. 4d). Notably, RAC1 A159V is paralogous to KRAS A146, a known activating mutation36. Whereas activating KRAS A146T mutations arise predominantly in colorectal carcinomas (Supplementary Table 2), RAC1 A159V mutations are most common in head and neck cancers and were not present in any melanomas, despite the frequency of RAC1 P29S in this cancer type. Moreover, similar to P29S mutations, we observed RAC1 A159V mutations in tumors that are both Ras/Raf wildtype and mutant (Fig. 4e). To determine whether RAC1 A159V is an activating mutation, we assessed its effect in vitro. Active RAC1 is GTP-bound, interacting with PAK1 to activate downstream effectors. Therefore, to quantify RAC1 activation in vitro, we utilized a PAK1 pull-down assay. In HEK293T cells expressing RAC1 A159V, there was significant RAC1 activation to levels equal to or exceeding positive control RAC1 GTPγS cells and greater than even those levels induced by the known RAC1 P29S oncogenic mutation (Fig. 4f). Moreover, cells expressing RAC1 Q61R, a mutation we identified in a primary prostate cancer that is paralogous to KRAS Q61, also potently induced RAC1 activation (Fig. 4d,f).  RRAS2 is a Ras-related small GTPase37. RRAS2 is overexpressed or mutated in a small number of cancer cell lines of various origins38–40, and is oncogenic in vitro with transforming ability similar to established Ras oncoproteins41. However, it has not been documented as somatically mutated in human tumor specimens. Here, we identified a RRAS2 Q72 hotspot present in nine tumors (q-value = 8×10−15). Similar to RAC1 A159V, the RRAS2 Q72 hotspot is paralogous to KRAS Q61 (Fig. 4d). However, unlike RAC1, RRAS2 Q72 does not predominate in any individual tumor type. Also unlike RAC1, the RRAS2 Q72 mutation was present in Ras/Raf wildtype tumors among the affected types (Fig. 4e). This result suggests that RRAS2 activation may be an alternative avenue for tumors to acquire Ras-like activation as previous studies have shown that RRAS2 shares many Ras downstream signaling elements including phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)42,43, the Ral GDP dissociation pathway42, and Raf kinases44. Beyond these hotspots, several less common RAC1 and RRAS2 mutations affect paralogous residues of highly recurrent alleles in KRAS (Fig. 4d), some of which we validated were also activating in vitro (Fig. 4f), indicating that the landscape of potentially functional mutations in these genes extends beyond even these less common long-tail hotspots to private mutations as well.  Go to: Discussion Although we focus only on recurrent substitutions, we did find that while a subset of hotspots were prevalent in individual cancer types, most hotspots are present infrequently across many cancer types. This indicates that studies of any individual cancer type may have limited power to identify novel alleles. We have also begun to detail best practices for the use of diverse public cancer sequencing data in the translational setting. Our approach for hotspot detection incorporates features such as the variable background mutational burden of individual codons and genes, thereby avoiding passenger mutations whose recurrence is due only to their presence in highly mutable amino acids. While the identification of private driver mutations remains challenging, our approach did uncover low-incidence hotspots in highly mutated genes. Though less common, these hotspots are under selection and may confer important clinical phenotypes in cancer patients, such as exceptional responses to cancer therapy30,31.  New mutant alleles in established genes are likely to emerge faster than new cancer genes are identified, extending the long tail of the frequency distribution of somatic mutations. This is especially true as clinical sequencing focuses on profiling advanced and metastatic disease for clinical trial enrollment. Such pre-treated, late-stage cases have been historically under-represented among such population-scale resources, including the one studied here. Moreover, at present there are fewer actionable mutations in cancer than there are cancer genes. Yet the near-term clinical utility of expanding the former is far greater. Our results suggest this will require an understanding of the function of different hotspot mutants in the same gene by lineage, as their function and response to therapy may be mutant amino acid specific. While positive selective pressure may produce the same hotspot mutation, or different variant amino acid changes within the same hotspot residue, it does not imply that they will confer similar selective advantages across lineages. Underlying functional distinctions may explain the differences observed here in the emergence and frequencies of hotspots across lineages. While this remains speculative or unknown for most hotspots, early evidence suggest that this will be true for even some of the most important alleles in human cancer8,9,11. Understanding this landscape of distinct molecular function is the necessary translational prerequisite for effective clinical implementation. This focus on mutations rather than genes will spur studies of the biochemical, biological, signaling impact, and drug sensitivity of candidate individual alleles. Collectively, the complementary study of both significantly mutated individual alleles as well as genes will prove indispensable in enabling precision oncology through clinical decision support for patients sequenced at the point of care.  Go to: Methods Mutational dataset and pre-processing  Mutational data were obtained from three publically available sources: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA); 2) the data portal of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC); 3) various published studies in peer-reviewed journals in which mutational data was made available45,46. Mutation calling algorithms and mutation reporting practices varied from study to study in these curated data, so mutation data review and correction were undertaken where possible. Genomic coordinates of variants from alignments to human reference assembly NCBI36 (hg18) were converted to GRCh37 using LiftOver47 with an Ensembl chain file (see URLs). After standardization to GRCh37, the mutation calls were annotated to gene transcripts in Ensembl release 75 (Gencode release 19), and a single canonical effect per mutation was reported using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) version 7748 and vcf2maf version 1.5. All possible pairs of any two samples with at least 10 somatic mutations were interrogated for sample duplication. For any pair of tumors that shared greater than 80% mutational identity and identical or near-identical clinic-pathological characteristics (upon review of data from the source site/publication), a single tumor in the pair was chosen at random and removed from further analysis as a presumptive duplicate specimen. Furthermore, we excluded small insertions and deletions (indels), despite their presence as true oncogenic hotspots in some genes, due to their greater variability in call quality across datasets. In total, the final dataset included 1,348,424 missense; 524,827 synonymous; 100,866 nonsense; 30,346 splice-site; and 3231 mutations affecting translational start or stop codons. There are also 21,130 oligo-nucleotide variants the majority of which are di-nucleotide mutations along with 71 tri-nucleotide mutations and 13 substitutions of 4bp or longer. Individual mutations and hotspots of interest (detected as described below) were inspected in individual BAM files from tumor and matched normal specimens of DNA and available RNA sequencing data downloaded from CGHub. When available, expression analyses were based on level-3 RNASeqV2 RSEM normalized gene expression counts from RNA sequencing available via the TCGA Data Coordinating Center. These values were log-transformed and scaled across all samples within each cancer type to facilitate comparisons between cancer types.  Definition of a mutational hotspot  For the purposes of this analysis, we first define a driver cancer gene as one in which a molecular abnormality leads to a fitness advantage for the affected cancer cell. This is the broadest definition that encompasses both initiating lesions on which tumor growth depends as well as lesions arising later in tumor progression that perhaps confer a more modest fitness advantage. We then define a hotspot as an amino acid position in protein-coding gene mutated more frequently than would be expected in the absence of selection. Therefore, all of the following mutation types result in the same hotspot: 1) mutations in different nucleotide positions in the same codon of a gene, 2) different nucleotide substitutions at the same site in the same codon that result in different amino acid changes, and 3) mutations where the amino acid substitution is identical but the nucleotide change are different. At present, this analysis is limited to recurrent somatic substitutions, but can be expanded to other classes of somatic alterations such as small insertions and deletions, DNA copy number alterations, and structural rearrangements.  Determining significant mutational hotspots  To determine the statistical significance of individual mutational hotspots, we developed a truncated binomial probability model by incorporating not only underlying features of mutation rates in cancer but also anticipating the gene-specific pattern with which hotspots may arise in different classes of possible cancer genes. In its most general form, if X represents the count of mutations in n samples, the probability of observing k mutations is:  Pr(X=k)=(nk)pk(1−p)n−k (1) where p is the probability of a mutation in any sample. However, differences exist in the mutability of specific nucleotide contexts in cancer genomes. These vary as a function of the underlying mutational process, potential molecular abnormality in normal DNA maintenance pathways, and possible exposure to exogenous mutagens16. Moreover, individual genes have highly variably nucleotide composition and background mutation rates. To address these fundamental characteristics, we integrated a coefficient into a position-specific probability that incorporates both the mutability of the trinucleotide context in which the mutation arose and the trinucleotide composition of the affected gene. For each of the 32 possible trinucleotides, we estimate the mutability of a given trinucleotide t as:  mt=CtFt (2) where Ct is the number of mutations affecting the central position of trinucleotide t across all samples and Ft is the number of occurrences of the trinucleotide t in the coding genome. Too little data existed to compute tumor type- or underlying mutational process-specific mutability. Because a mutated codon in a given gene is comprised of mutations in any one of three trinucleotides that encode that codon, we estimate the mutability of a codon c in gene g as:  mc,g=∑t∈cmtnt,cnc (3) where nt,c is the number of mutations in the central position of trinucleotide t in codon c and nc is the number of mutations in codon c overall. We estimate the mutability of gene g as μg = Cg/(nLg), where Cg is the number of mutations affecting the gene across the n samples and Lg is the length of the gene in amino acids. We then estimated the expected mutability of a given gene g as:  mg=∑tNt,gmtLG (4) where Nt,g is the number of occurrences of trinucleotide t in gene g. The relative mutability of a codon within a gene is then rc,g = mc,g/mg. This leads to a binomial parameter for hotspot detection of:  pc,g=rc,gμg (5) We sought to avoid overestimating the background mutation rate for a gene with several hotspots. This would limit the detection of lower frequency hotspots (warmspots) due to the rate of recurrence of one or a few dominant hotspots in the same gene. We therefore developed a truncated form by removing positions in gene g bearing greater than or equal to the 99th percentile of all mutations in the gene. The new background rate is therefore μ′g, calculated as before where the prime signifies the mutation counts and lengths modified using the above threshold. Then p′c,g=rc,gμ′g. Finally, in rarely mutated genes where the probability p is exceedingly small (relative to the size of the cohort N and the length of the protein L), we limited the number of false positive hotspots by allowing p′c,g to get no smaller than the 20th percentile of all p′ dataset-wide. Therefore, the final binomial probability is:  p′′c,g=max{p′c,g20%ile of allp' (6) Accordingly, we calculate one-sided p-values for all unique amino acids in every annotated gene per the binomial form given in eq. (1) with probability from eq. (6) and test whether more mutations are observed than would be expected by chance given the pattern of all mutations in the gene; its composition and length; the pattern of its mutability; and the number and type of samples assessed.  Multiple hypothesis correction  To correct for multiple hypotheses, we employed a method for false discovery rate correction that assumes dependence among tests. This correction was performed on the gene level in the following manner. P-values were aggregated per gene on the basis of their codon position. For codons that were not mutated in a given gene and therefore not formally assessed, we padded this with a vector of p-values equal to 1 such that the final set of p-values equaled the amino acid length of the given gene. For all resulting p-values in each gene, they were corrected with the Benjamini and Yekutieli49 method (implemented in p.adjust in the stats package in R) and significant hotspots were those sites with q-values < 0.01.  Mutation call quality filtering  Considerable variability exists in the processing and generation of mutational data in individual cohorts by originating centers. To address this variability, we developed several weight-of-evidence based criteria for eliminating presumptive false positives and sequencing artifacts from individual mutation calls as well as from hotspots across the dataset (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Initially, to exclude likely germline variants misattributed as somatic mutations we exclude any mutation identified by both 1000genomes and the NHLBI or those identified only by 1000genomes in two or more samples. We then reasoned that hotspots arising in genes not expressed in a given tumor type are less likely to exert biological impact. We therefore removed from consideration hotspot mutations in genes whose expression was <0.1 transcripts per million (TPM) in 90% or more of the tumors of that type, or for tumors that lacked RNA sequencing data, if more than 95% of all tumors independent of organ of origin had expression of TPM < 0.1. After determining statistically significant hotspots (described above), hotspots were removed from consideration based on a decision tree model as follows. First, a presumptive true positive (pTPs) list of hotspots was predetermined as coding positions harboring substitutions in five or more tumor samples (from the August 2013 release of the cBioPortal45,46) in one of 341 key cancer-associated genes sequenced as part of routine CLIA-certified sequencing of matched tumor and normal specimens at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center50. Initially, for all samples in which a hotspot was observed and for which the fraction of tumor cells mutated could be calculated from corresponding variant allele frequency and DNA copy number data, we calculated the fraction of tumors in which that site was mutated subclonally (in fewer than 90% of tumor cells). If the fraction of samples in which the hotspot arose subclonally exceeded the maximum such value among pTPs, it was excluded. For remaining sites, we excluded potential hotspots that arose from mutation calling bias from a single source center. We identified cohorts in which subsets of samples were called by different centers and excluded hotspots in which greater than 85% of contributing mutation calls originated from a single mutation-calling center. Next, as local sequence complexity can affect alignment accuracy in various ways based on the read lengths and chemistry of source studies in our dataset, we sought to exclude hotspots on the basis of sequence context. We excluded hotspots where the minimum of Shannon entropy calculated from both 12bp or 24bp of flanking sequence on either the 5’ or 3’ side of the mutated site was less than the minimum such value among pTPs. We then excluded hotspots that were positioned at either the 5’ or 3’ end of a mono-, di-, or tri-nucleotide homopolymer runs of 10bp or longer. Remaining hotspots were then excluded if either the sum of their ranked weighted 100 and 24bp alignability (determined by CRG Alignability; UCSC Genome Browser) was less than the minimum value of pTPs or their weighted 24bp alignability was lower than the 12.5 percentile of all sites. We also excluded any hotspot that while passing these criteria affected a gene that was 1) already rich in presumptive false positives by these criteria [the number of retained hotspots was less than two times the count of hotspots in the gene excluded by one or more of these criteria] or 2) one of 20 well-characterized presumptive “red-herring” cancer genes due to high mutation rates that co-vary with underlying features independent of selection4. Finally, we manually inspected the sequencing data contributing to the mutation call for select hotspots in a sampling of affected tumor and matched normal samples. The significant hotspots (q-value < 0.01) that were excluded from consideration on the basis of this model are available in Supplementary Table 3.  Hotspot mutation data and literature review  In addition to the mutation call filtering described above, we independently validated the accuracy of a subset of mutation calls contributing to the novel hotspots discussed in the text. We downloaded BAM files of the aligned and unaligned sequencing reads corresponding to the tumor and matched normal exomes from each patient harboring one of the novel hotspots we discuss in detail in the manuscript (RAC1 A159; RRAS2 Q72; NUP93 E14 and Q15; MAX R60; and MAX H28) and reprocessed these from raw FASTQ to mutation calls with an independent sequence analysis pipeline30,31. We re-identified the hotspot mutation of interest in 34 of 35 affected specimens. Only a single sample failed to reproduce the published mutation (NUP93 E14 in a hepatocellular carcinoma), but NUP93 E14K remains statistically significant even after excluding the tumor in which the mutation was not called by the independent pipeline. To determine novel hotspots among the 470 identified here, we classified each mutation into one of three levels of evidence from an extensive literature review (Supplementary Table 2). Level-1 mutations are those not previously identified in human tumors or have been identified in an individual sample, but never described as a hotspot of recurrent mutation. This also includes mutations previously documented in the germline of patients, but never identified previously as recurrently somatically mutated. Level-2 hotspots are those mutations that have been reported previously in one tumor type that we also identified in the same, but also find mutated in one or more additional tumor types not previously described. Level-3 hotspots are those mutations that have been previously identified in one or more tumor types and have been assessed functionally in vitro or in vivo. Using this categorization, we identified 243, 46, and 181 levels-1, -2, and -3 mutations from the 470 hotspots described here. These were classified as being present or not in established candidate cancer genes (n=880, Fig. 1b) compiled from the Sanger Cancer Gene Census and four additional published sources1,4,5,50.  Cell type specificity analysis  We determined the enrichment of individual hotspots in different cell types (squamous versus non-squamous). For this analysis, squamous cell cancers included head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Hotspots mutated in at least one squamous tumor were examined and their statistical significance was assed with Fisher’s exact test assuming the null hypothesis that squamous and non-squamous tumor samples are equally likely to possess a given hotspot. Resulting p-values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing with Benjamini and Yekutieli49 method and squamous cell-type specific hotspots were those with q-values < 0.01.  Analysis of the fraction of cancer cells mutated  Level-3 segmentation of DNA copy number data was acquired when available without restriction for 15 cohorts (primarily TCGA). Utilizing this data, we estimated tumor purity using absCN-seq51, due to the ease of its automation. We calculated the fraction of tumor cells bearing each mutation (tumor/cancer cell fraction) in each tumor based on this purity estimate, local copy number, and mutant and reference allele sequencing coverage all as previously described52.  Functional validation  DNA coding sequences for wildtype RAC1 as well as RAC1P29S, RAC1Q61R, and RAC1A159V were generated via site-directed mutagenesis (Genewiz, NJ) to include an N-terminal 3xFLAG epitope tag and were subcloned into a pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Life Technologies, NY). The expression constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), and cells were harvested after 72 hours. GTP-bound Rac1 (active Rac1) was isolated via immunoprecipitation using recombinant p21-binding domain (PBD) of PAK1 (PAK1-PBD; Active Rac1 Detection Kit, Cat#8815, Cell Signaling, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Rac1 was detected using kit provided Rac1 primary antibody.  The RhoA GTPase regulates diverse cellular processes including cytoskeletal reorganization, transcription and transformation. Although many different potential RhoA effectors have been identified, including two families of protein kinases, their roles in RhoA-regulated events remain unclear. We used a genetic screen to identify mutations at positions 37–42 in the RhoA effector loop that selectively disrupt effector binding, and used these to investigate the role of RhoA effectors in the formation of actin stress fibres, activation of transcription by serum response factor (SRF) and transformation. Interaction with the ROCK kinase and at least one other unidentified effector is required for stress fibre formation. Signalling to SRF by RhoA can occur in the absence of RhoA-induced cytoskeletal changes, and did not correlate with binding to any of the effectors tested, indicating that it may be mediated by an unknown effector. Binding to ROCK-I, but not activation of SRF, correlated with the activity of RhoA in transformation. The effector mutants should provide novel approaches for the functional study of RhoA and isolation of effector molecules involved in specific signalling processes. Keywords: cytoskeleton/PKN/RhoA/ROCK/serum response element/SRF/transformation Introduction The Rho subfamily of Ras-like GTPases transduce signals regulating many cellular processes, including cell morphology, cell motility, cell proliferation, gene expression and cytokinesis. In the case of mammalian RhoA, a number of potential effector molecules have been identified which interact preferentially with the GTP-bound form of RhoA (for review see Lim et al., 1996). By analogy with Ras, it is presumed that these interactions alter the subcellular localization or enzymatic activity of effector molecules and thereby transmit downstream signals (for review see Marshall, 1996). RhoA effectors include two families of protein kinases, the ROCKs (also known as ROKs; Leung et al., 1995, 1996; Nakagawa et al., 1996; Ishizaki et al., 1997) and PKN-related kinases (the PRK family; Palmer et al., 1994; Amano et al., 1996; Watanabe et al., 1996; Vincent and Settleman, 1997). In addition, RhoA can 1350 © Oxford University Press interact with the myosin binding subunit of MLC phosphatase (Kimura et al., 1996); putative adaptor proteins such as Rhotekin, Rhophilin and Citron (Madaule et al., 1995; Reid et al., 1996; Watanabe et al., 1996), two mouse Diaphanous homologues, p140mDia and mDia2 (Alberts et al., 1998b; Watanabe et al., 1997), and Kinectin (Hotta et al., 1996; Alberts et al., 1998b). Biochemical studies have provided strong evidence that the ROCKs, MLC phosphatase and possibly mDia participate in RhoAinduced cytoskeletal reorganization (Kimura et al., 1996; Leung et al., 1996; Matsui et al., 1996; Amano et al., 1997a,b; Ishizaki et al., 1997; Watanabe et al., 1997; reviewed by Lim et al., 1996; Narumiya et al., 1997). In addition to its roles in cytoskeletal reorganization, RhoA-induced signalling is implicated in gene transcription, cell-cycle progression, and cell transformation. Functional RhoA is required for serum- and LPA-induced activation of the transcription factor SRF, and activated forms of the protein can activate SRF in the absence of external stimuli (Hill et al., 1995). In addition, RhoA can modulate TNFα-induced activity of the NF-κB transcription factor (Perona et al., 1997). Functional RhoA is required for the G1–S transition in Swiss 3T3 cells, and microinjection of activated RhoA protein can induce quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells to enter the cell cycle (Yamamoto et al., 1993; Olson et al., 1995). RhoA is required for Ras-mediated transformation, and activated forms of the protein co-operate with Raf in focus formation assays in NIH 3T3 cells (Khosravi-Far et al., 1995; Olson et al., 1995; Qiu et al., 1995; Cerione and Zheng, 1996). Moreover, mutated derivatives of several Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) have been isolated in different screens for transforming genes (for review see Cerione and Zheng, 1996). Although it is tempting to speculate that the ability of RhoA to activate transcription is related to its role in the regulation of cell-cycle progression and transformation, there is no direct evidence to support this view since the signalling pathways involved remain unclear. One way to investigate signalling pathways regulated by Ras-like GTPases is to examine the signalling properties of mutant proteins in which effector–protein binding is defective. Binding of Ras to its effectors is mediated by a sequence known as the effector loop, which changes conformation when GTP is bound (Willumsen et al., 1986; Pai et al., 1989; Milburn et al., 1990; reviewed by Marshall, 1996). Mutations in this region can selectively disrupt its interactions with different effectors, thereby allowing the functional consequences of the particular interactions to be distinguished (White et al., 1995; Joneson et al., 1996b; Khosravi-Far et al., 1996). Mutations of this type can also be generated in Rhofamily proteins (Freeman et al., 1996; Joneson et al., 1996a; Lamarche et al., 1996; Westwick et al., 1997). In RhoA effector mutants this paper we have generated RhoA effector-loop mutants and investigated their abilty to induce cytoskeletal rearrangements, SRF activation and transformation. Our results show that RhoA-induced stress fibre formation requires interaction with ROCK-I and a distinct effector, and that RhoA-induced signalling to SRF does not correlate with its activity in transformation. Results Generation of RhoA effector mutants We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify RhoA effector mutants that selectively impair interaction of RhoA with its protein kinase effectors PKN and ROCK-I. For use in the assay, RhoA.V14/S190, an activated RhoA derivative lacking the C-terminal CAAX motif, was fused C-terminally to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Alberts et al., 1998b). The yeast reporter strain HF7C was used to score interactions of Gal4-RhoA.V14/S190 with PKN and ROCK-I, each tagged with the Gal4 activation domain to allow detection in the assay. Interactions were monitored both by expression of the His3 gene, which allows growth on medium lacking histidine, and by expression of the β-galactosidase gene, using a colony colour assay. We first used the two-hybrid system to identify mutations that selectively impair interactions with PKN or ROCK-I (see Materials and methods). Cassette mutagenesis was used to generate a library of RhoA mutants in which codons 37, 38, 39 and 40 were individually randomized. In one screen, growth on plates lacking histidine was used to identify mutants able to interact with PKN, which were then rescreened for those unable to interact with mouse ROCK-I(348–1018). Four mutants, C20R/T37Y, C20R/F39L, E40L and E40W were recovered (the C20R mutation was presumably generated by the PCR). In a second screen, cassette mutants able to interact with ROCK-I(348–1018) were rescreened to identify those incapable of interaction with PKN. This screen identified the mutants F39V, E40N and E40T. We also created RhoA mutations analogous to those known to impair other GTPase–effector interactions, an approach used successfully to generate Rac1 and Cdc42 mutants (Lamarche et al., 1996; Westwick et al., 1997). The mutants constructed were F39A and Y42C, which in Rac1 and Cdc42 disrupt interaction with ROCK-I and PAK respectively (Lamarche et al., 1996). Binding properties of RhoA effector mutants We used the two-hybrid assay to examine the binding of the effector-loop mutants to different RhoA effectors. In addition to PKN and ROCK-I, we examined interaction with Rhophilin (Watanabe et al., 1996), Citron (Madaule et al., 1995), mDia2, a p140mDia-related protein (Alberts et al., 1998b; Watanabe et al., 1997), Kinectin (Hotta et al., 1996; Alberts et al., 1998b) and mNET1, a RhoA GEF (Chan et al., 1996; Alberts et al., 1998b; A.S.Alberts and R.Treisman, submitted). Interaction in yeast was assessed by growth on medium lacking histidine containing increasing amounts of aminotriazole. Results are shown in Table I. RhoA.V14/S190 exhibited a wide range of activities with the different effectors, ranging from growth on His– medium but sensitivity to 1 mM aminotriazole (intact PKN) to growth on His– medium containing 1351 32 mM aminotriazole [mDia2(47–800)]. Comparison with β-galactosidase assays performed in parallel indicate that this represents a range of at least 100-fold (see Table I legend). Of the four mutants recovered in the screen for RhoA.V14 derivatives that can interact with PKN but not ROCK-I(348–1018), C20R/F39L also showed greatly impaired interaction with Rhophilin and Citron (Table I). The other three mutants, C20R/T37Y, E40L and E40W, exhibited an increased background activity in the assay in the absence of the activator-tagged effector, which did not increase in the presence of the intact PKN (Table I); nevertheless, mutants E40L and E40W interacted indistinguishably from intact RhoA with the N-terminal region of PKN (Table I; see Discussion). The E40L and E40W mutations reduced interaction with ROCK-I(348–1018) and Kinectin to background levels, but other interactions were essentially unimpaired (Table I). The fourth mutation recovered in this screen, C20R/T37Y, showed no interaction above background level with any of the proteins tested apart from mNET1 and Rhophilin, whose interaction was greatly reduced relative to wild-type (Table I; see Discussion). Next we examined mutants recovered in the screen for interaction with ROCK-I(348–1018) but not PKN. Again mutation of different residues within the effector loop produced different effects on interaction. Mutant F39V exhibited profoundly impaired interaction with all effectors tested apart from ROCK-I and mNET1 (Table I, row 4). In contrast, mutants E40N and E40T exhibited substantially different behaviour. Although these mutants were selected by their inability to bind PKN, they interacted effectively with its N-terminal domain (Table I; see Discussion). Their interaction with other proteins was largely unimpaired, apart from Kinectin and mNET1 which were substantially reduced (Table I). Finally, we examined F39A and Y42C. These mutations block interaction with both PKN(1–511) and intact PKN. Mutant F39A blocked interaction with all other effectors tested apart from mDia2(47–800), while mutant Y42C affected no other interactions (Table I). To corroborate the two-hybrid data we used an in vitro binding assay. GST fusion genes carrying PKN(1–511), ROCK-I(348–1018) and mDia2(47–257) were constructed and equal amounts of each fusion proteins bound to glutathione–Sepharose beads. Different 9E10 epitopetagged RhoA.V14 mutants, each GTPγS-loaded, were allowed to interact with the GST fusion proteins, and the levels of bound protein measured by 9E10 immunoblot following extensive washing. The results are shown in Figure 1. The ability of the mutants to bind PKN(1–511) in general reflected the interactions seen in the two-hybrid assay, although weak interactions were detectable with mutants C20R/T37Y, F39V and Y42C upon prolonged exposure (see Figure 1B). Effector-loop mutants that interacted efficiently with ROCK-I(348–1018) in the twohybrid assay also bound it strongly in vitro; however, in contrast to the two-hybrid data, mutants C20R/T37Y and E40W also bound weakly to ROCK-I(348–1018) in vitro (Figure 1C; see Discussion). All the RhoA mutants bound to mDia2(47–257) in vitro (Figure 1D). Taken together with the two-hybrid results, these data show that we have E.Sahai, A.S.Alberts and R.Treisman Table I.

With wild-type RhoA.V14, interactions corresponded to LacZ activities as follows: PKN(1–942), ø0.5 units; PKN(1–511), 0.5 units; ROCK-I(348–1018), 52 units; Rhophilin (1–130), 67 units; Kinectin (1053–1327), 16 units; Citron (674–780), 95 units; mDia2 (47–800), 153 units.

Mutant RhoA.V14 proteins bound to GST–PKN(1– 511) (B), GST–ROCK-I(348–1018) (C) or GST–mDia2(47–257) (D) were detected with 9E10 antibody following elution, SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting. identified RhoA effector-loop mutants that can discriminate between different RhoA effector proteins. Regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization by RhoA effector mutants Studies with the ROCKs have implicated these kinases in cytoskeletal reorganization events including formation of stress fibres and focal adhesions (Kimura et al., 1996; Leung et al., 1996; Matsui et al., 1996; Ishizaki et al., 1997). We therefore investigated the effects of effectorloop mutations upon RhoA-induced cytoskeletal reorganization. Expression plasmids encoding 9E10 epitopetagged RhoA.V14 or effector-loop mutants were microinjected into serum-deprived NIH 3T3 cells, and filamentous 1352 actin and RhoA visualized by staining with phalloidin and 9E10 antibody respectively. Serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells displayed low levels of filamentous actin, usually organized into a few short fibres with no particular organization with respect to one another. Expression of RhoA.V14 promoted the reorganization of filamentous actin, organized into parallel stress fibres 5 h following plasmid injection (Figure 2A, panels 1 and 2). We also examined focal adhesion formation by staining with vinculin antibodies; however, the relatively high basal level of focal adhesions in our serum-deprived NIH 3T3 cells precluded evaluation of the effects of the mutants, and we did not pursue these studies further (data not shown). All the RhoA mutants were expressed at similar high levels and showed similar subcellular distribution (Figure 2A, insets). However, they varied in their ability to induce stress fibres. Expression of mutants E40N, E40T and Y42C triggered efficient stress fibre formation, although those formed by E40T appeared shorter and less numerous than those formed by RhoA.V14 (Figure 2A). Each of these mutants can interact with ROCK-I(348-1018). In contrast, mutants F39A, C20R/F39L, E40L and E40W, which do not interact with ROCK-I(348–1018), did not induce efficient stress fibre formation. Interestingly, F39V also did not promote stress fibre formation, even though its interaction with ROCK-I(348–1018) is unimpaired, suggesting additional effectors may be required for fibre formation. To test this we investigated whether the F39V mutant could co-operate functionally with F39A, F39L, E40L and E40W, none of which can bind ROCK-I, or induce stress fibre formation by itself. Simultaneous expression of F39V and E40W efficiently induced stress fibre formation, and the combination of F39V and E40L was partially active; F39A and F39L were ineffective (Figure 2). The inability of F39L, which binds PKN, to co-operate with F39V in this assay, together with the RhoA effector mutants Fig. 2. Regulation of cytoskeleton by RhoA mutants. (A) NIH 3T3 cells were microinjected (arrowheads) with expression plasmids encoding 9E10 epitope-tagged RhoA.V14 mutants. Filamentous actin was visualized with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (main panels) and expressed RhoA.V14 derivatives were visualized with 9E10 antibody (inset panels). (B) Summary of data. PKN.C expresses the catalytic domain of the RhoA effector kinase PKN (see Figure 4). Proportion of injected cells with large number of long stress fibres arranged in parallel sheets (average of three independent experiments, 20–30 cells were injected per coverslip; error bars indicate SEM). Note that mutant F39L also contains the C20R mutation. 1353 E.Sahai, A.S.Alberts and R.Treisman finding that Y42C can induce stress fibres although it does not bind PKN, suggest that the additional effector cannot be PKN (see below). Regulation of SRF activity by RhoA effector mutants Serum- or LPA-stimulated activity of SRF-controlled reporter genes in NIH 3T3 cells is dependent on RhoA, and SRF activity can be greatly increased by co-expression of activated RhoA (Hill et al., 1995). To gain insight into which downstream effectors are involved in these phenomena, we examined the ability of effector-loop mutants to activate SRF. To facilitate comparison with other functional assays for RhoA.V14, we tested the mutants using both transfection and microinjection assays. For the microinjection assay we used the reporter plasmid 3D.AFosHA, in which a minimal promoter containing three SRF binding sites controls expression of an HA epitope-tagged Fos protein which can be monitored by indirect immunofluorescence (Hill et al., 1995; Alberts et al., 1998a). Microinjection of expression plasmids encoding RhoA.V14 and effector-loop mutants F39A, F39V, C20R/F39L, E40N, E40T and Y42C all activated the reporter efficiently. In contrast, mutant E40W triggered a partial response, while E40L did not lead to significant activation above background (Figure 3A). To obtain a more quantitative measure of the relative efficacy of SRF activation by the different effector mutants we used a transfection assay. For this assay we used the reporter 3D.ACAT (Hill et al., 1995), in which the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene is controlled by exactly the same promoter used in microinjection assay. In each case varying amounts of RhoA-expression plasmids were co-transfected with the reporter, and upon harvesting the samples were split and processed to measure both CAT activity and RhoA expression level. As in the microinjection experiments, mutants F39V and Y42C activated the reporter as effectively as RhoA.V14 itself; in contrast activation by mutants E40L and E40W was at background levels (Figure 3B). The other mutants, F39A, C20R/F39L, E40N and E40T exhibited intermediate abilities to activate the reporter. Taken together with the microinjection results, these data indicate that the identity of residue 40 within the effector loop is of particular importance for SRF activation. The data show that the ability of RhoA.V14 to potentiate SRF activity can be clearly dissociated from its ability to promote stress fibre formation (compare Figures 2A and 3A, mutants F39A, C20R/F39L and F39V), and that changes in cell morphology are not a prerequisite for potentiation of SRF activity. However, in neither assay does the ability of RhoA.V14 to potentiate SRF activity correlate with the binding of a single effector (see Discussion). The ROCK-I and PKN kinase domains cannot activate SRF independently of RhoA function The data presented above suggest that either a novel RhoA effector is involved in signalling to SRF, or that multiple effectors are involved. In the light of the latter possibility, it was of interest to note that all mutants that bound to ROCK-I(348–1018) were able to signal to the SRE, consistent with the notion that although interaction with 1354 Fig. 3. Regulation of SRE by RhoA mutants. (A) Microinjection assay. NIH 3T3 cells were microinjected with 3D.AFosHA reporter plasmid and 9E10 epitope-tagged RhoA expression plasmids; RhoA and reporter expression was visualized 5 h later. The proportion of injected cells expressing reporter construct (average of three independent experiments; error bars indicate SEM). (B) Transfection assay. NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with the SRF-controlled reporter plasmid 3D.ACAT (1000 ng), together with increasing amounts of RhoA expression plasmids (200, 500 or 1000 ng) as indicated. Two days later, cell lysates were prepared and analysed for RhoA protein expression by immunoblot (top panel) CAT reporter gene activity (lower panel). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments; a representative experiment is shown. Note that mutant F39L also contains the C20R mutation. ROCK-I might not be required for RhoA to signal to SRF, it may nevertheless be able to activate transcription at the SRE. Moreover, it has been reported that the PKN family kinase PRK2 kinase domain can potentiate SRF activity (Quilliam et al., 1996). We therefore investigated whether the isolated kinase domains of ROCK-I and PKN were capable of potentiating SRF activity, using kinase-inactive derivatives to test whether any effects required kinase activity. To verify that any observed effects on SRF result from activation of pathways downstream of RhoA, we used co-expression of the specific Rho inhibitor C3 transferase to inactivate cellular RhoA (Hill et al., 1995). Microinjection of NIH 3T3 cells with an expression plasmid encoding intact ROCK-I had no effect on SRF reporter expression (Figure 4A), but promoted formation of thick actin filaments distinct from those induced by RhoA.V14 (Figure 4B). Next we investigated ROCK∆3 (ROCK-I, codons 1–727), a truncated ROCK-I derivative which contains the N-terminal kinase domain and part of the coiled region, but lacks C-terminal sequences including the RhoA interaction domain (Ishizaki et al., 1997).

Serum-deprived NIH 3T3 cells were microinjected with 3D.AFosHA reporter plasmid and either vector alone or the indicated combinations of 9E10 epitope-tagged ROCK-I and C3 expression plasmids. ROCK, codons 1–1354; ROCK∆3, codons 1–727; ROCK∆3kd, codons 1–727/K105A (kinase inactive); PKN, codons 1–942; PKN.C, codons 539–942. Five hours following injection, injected cells and FosHA protein were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-guinea-pig IgG or 9E10 and Y11 antibodies, respectively. Serum stimulation was for 1 h where indicated. Results are from three independent experiments, 20–50 cells injected per coverslip. Error bar indicates SEM. (B) Cytoskeletal rearrangements induced by ROCK-I derivatives. Serumdeprived NIH 3T3 cells were microinjected with the indicated combinations of ROCK-I, PKN, RhoA effector mutant and C3 expression plasmids as in (A). After 5 h, filamentous actin was visualized using TRITC–phalloidin. Between 20 and 30 cells were injected per coverslip; representative cells from one of three experiments are shown. For data summary see Figure 2B. Immune complex kinase assays using extracts from transfected NIH 3T3 cells expressing ROCK∆3 indicated that this protein possesses substantially increased histone kinase activity compared with over-expressed wild-type ROCK-I (data not shown). Upon microinjection of the ROCK∆3 expression plasmid together with the 3D.AFosHA reporter, approximately one-third of injected cells showed reporter gene activation; surprisingly, however, this was dependent on endogenous Rho function, since it was blocked by C3 transferase expression (Figure 4A). All cells injected with ROCK∆3 exhibited thick actin bundles radiating from hub-like actin structures very different from the stress fibres produced by RhoA.V14; as with intact ROCK-I, this was unaffected by C3 transferase 1355 (Figure 4B). Similar results have been reported for Swiss 3T3 cells (Amano et al., 1997a), but not HeLa cells (Ishizaki et al., 1997). Both reporter gene activity and cytoskeletal reorganization were not observed in cells injected with a kinase-inactive ROCK∆3 derivative (data not shown). Although the effector mutant studies strongly suggest that interaction of RhoA.V14 with PKN is not a prerequisite for SRF activation, we also investigated whether expression of a constitutively active form of PKN is sufficient for SRE activation or stress fibre formation. Immune complex kinase assays using extracts from NIH 3T3 cells transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the PKN kinase domain (PKN.C; amino acids 539–942) E.Sahai, A.S.Alberts and R.Treisman Fig. 5. Loss of contact inhibition caused by RhoA mutants and Raf. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding RhoA derivatives (500 ng), SRFVP16 (500 ng) or ROCK mutants (500 ng) either with (black bars) or without (grey bars) a plasmid encoding activated Raf (EXV∆NRaf; 500 ng). At 15 days posttransfection the number of foci of size .1.5 mm was counted. The efficiency of focus formation relative to RhoA.V14 1 ∆NRaf is shown (average of three independent experiments, error bar indicates SEM). The combination of RhoA.V14 and ∆NRaf produced on average 38 foci per plate transfected. Note that mutant F39L also contains the C20R mutation. indicated that this protein possesses substantial constitutive histone kinase activity (data not shown). However, expression of either intact PKN or PKN.C neither activated the SRF reporter gene (Figure 4A) nor induced actin stress fibres (Figure 4B; data not shown). Moreover, consistent with the effector mutant data which suggests that interaction between RhoA and PKN is not required for stress fibre formation, we found that the active PKN.C mutant did not co-operate with F39V to induce stress fibre formation (Figure 4B). Taken together with the effector mutant data, these results are consistent with the view that neither ROCK-I nor PKN constitute single RhoA effectors that mediate SRF activation, and support the hypothesis that RhoA.V14- induced SRF activation is mediated either by a novel effector, or that multiple RhoA effectors are involved in the response (see Discussion). Focus formation by RhoA effector mutants in cooperation with Raf Expression of activated derivatives of RhoA such as RhoA.V14 results in reduced serum- and anchoragedependent growth (Perona et al., 1993), and RhoA.V14 can co-operate with activated Raf derivatives to induce transformation (Khosravi-Far et al., 1995, 1996; Qiu et al., 1995). We therefore used the effector mutants to investigate whether the ability of RhoA.V14 to co-operate with activated Raf in NIH 3T3 transformation correlates with its ability to potentiate SRF activity. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding either RhoA.V14 or its effector-loop mutants, with or without an expression plasmid encoding ∆NRaf (Leevers and Marshall, 1992), and the foci stained and counted 2 weeks later. In this assay, RhoA.V14 and its mutant derivatives F39V, E40N, E40T and Y42C, each of which can interact with ROCK-I(348–1018), promoted focus formation in co-operation with ∆NRaf (Figure 5). In contrast, the efficiency of transformation by the other effector mutants was not significantly greater than that observed with ∆NRaf alone; in particular, mutant F39A, which activates 1356 SRF with efficiency comparable to mutants E40N and E40T, was inactive in the transformation assay. Finally, SRF-VP16, an activated SRF derivative, did not co-operate with ∆NRaf in focus formation (Figure 5). Thus, cooperation between RhoA.V14 and ∆NRaf in transformation does not appear to reflect the ability of RhoA.V14 to activate SRF. Discussion RhoA effector-loop mutants In this study we generated mutations in the effector-loop region of RhoA that selectively disrupted its interaction with downstream effector proteins. Such mutations have been generated previously in Ras, Rac and Cdc42 (White et al., 1995; Freeman et al., 1996; Joneson et al., 1996a; Lamarche et al., 1996; Westwick et al., 1997). We identi- fied mutations at RhoA codons 37, 39, 40 and 42 that prevent interaction with PKN, ROCK-I, or both. Binding studies demonstrated that these mutations also selectively disrupt interactions with other RhoA effectors, indicating that the effector loop makes subtly different contacts with the different proteins. We used the mutants to investigate the role of RhoA effectors in cytoskeletal rearrangement, SRF activation and focus formation in NIH 3T3 cells. Although activated RhoA can potentiate the kinase activity of both ROCK-I and PKN (Kimura et al., 1996; Watanabe et al., 1996; Amano et al., 1997b; Ishizaki et al., 1997; Vincent and Settleman, 1997), the modest degree of activation precluded its investigation using the mutants. Stress fibre formation likely involves interaction both with ROCK and a second effector. SRF activation correlates with binding to neither PKN, ROCK-I nor any other single effector tested, suggesting a novel effector may be responsible. Focus formation by activated RhoA in combination with activated Raf correlates with ROCK-I binding rather than SRF activation. Binding of RhoA to its effectors Interaction between PKN and RhoA.V14 could only be scored in the two-hybrid assay by use of the sensitive HIS3 reporter gene, although it was readily detectable in vitro. Mutations F39V and Y42C both abolish interaction with PKN, but maintain normal interaction with ROCK-I; in contrast, mutation C20R/F39L maintains interactions with PKN but abolishes interactions with ROCK-I. Mutant F39A abolishes interaction with both kinases. Several mutants at codon 40 isolated in the twohybrid screen as defective for interaction with intact PKN retained the ability to interact with its RhoA-binding N-terminal region: the isolation of these mutants presumably reflects the extreme sensitivity of the HIS3 reporter assay to small changes in interaction strength, and it is possible that these mutations have no substantial effect on RhoA–PKN interaction. PKN and Rhophilin interact with RhoA via a common sequence motif (Watanabe et al., 1996), and their binding is in general affected similarly by effector-loop mutations, although C20R/F39L specifically reduces Rhophilin binding. Effector-loop residues F39 and Y42 are conserved in Rac1 and in both proteins mutations F39A, F39L and Y42C have similar effects on ROCK-I binding, suggesting that the molecular contacts are similar (Joneson et al., 1996a; Lamarche RhoA effector mutants et al., 1996). Finally, ROCK-I and Kinectin interact with RhoA via related sequences (Alberts et al., 1998b), but the interaction with Kinectin appears weaker, since it is abolished by all mutations save Y42C. In the two-hybrid assay, mutant C20R/T37Y interacted with only the putative Rho-family GEF mNET1 (Chan et al., 1996), even though interactions with other effector proteins were readily detectable in vitro. Residue T37 or its equivalent co-ordinates a magnesium ion required for nucleotide binding, and is universally conserved in Raslike GTPases (Pai et al., 1989; Hirshberg et al., 1997; Rittinger et al., 1997). The failure of C20R/T37Y to manifest two-hybrid interactions may therefore reflect inefficient nucleotide binding, in contrast to the in vitro assays in which the GTPase is biochemically loaded with GTPγS. However, the C20R–T37Y mutant is impaired in in vitro interaction with GST–PKN(1–511), so this residue probably also makes specific effector interactions, as observed previously with Ras (White et al., 1995). The consequences of effector-loop mutations on interactions with Citron, mNET1, and mDia2, were distinct from those on PKN and ROCK-I. Mutations at position 39, but not those at 40 and 42, abolished interaction with Citron. The F39A, E40N and E40T mutants all exhibited defective binding to mNET1, and it is intriguing to note that corresponding residues in Ras may mediate its interaction with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ras GEFs Cdc25 and Sdc25 (Mistou et al., 1992; White et al., 1995). Interaction with mDia2, which is closely related in its RhoA-binding region to p140mDia (Watanabe et al., 1997), was unaffected by any of the mutations, including F39A, which abolished interactions with all other proteins tested. The primary site of mDia2 (and probably mDia) interaction with RhoA may therefore be distinct from the effector loop. In Rac proteins, the ‘Rho family insert region’ at codons 125–137, which constitutes an extra surface-exposed helix (Hirshberg et al., 1997; Rittinger et al., 1997), is required for efficient and productive interaction with the NADPH oxidase complex (Freeman et al., 1996; Nisimoto et al., 1997). Perhaps the RhoA insert region, rather than the effector loop, interacts with mDia and mDia2. RhoA requires multiple effectors to produce stress fibres Several previous studies in various cell types have suggested that the ROCKs are involved in RhoA-induced stress fibre formation (Leung et al., 1996; Amano et al., 1997a; Ishizaki et al., 1997). However, both our data and previous studies of ROCK-I mutants (Ishizaki et al., 1997) suggest that while ROCK-I is involved in the process it is not sufficient. Mutants F39A, C20R–F39L, E40L and E40W neither bind ROCK-I nor trigger stress fibre formation; in contrast, mutant F39V retains the ability to bind ROCK-I, but promotes stress fibre formation only in combination with mutant E40W (Table II). The data therefore show that formation of stress fibres requires the interaction of RhoA with both ROCK-I and another effector, which cannot bind F39V. Several observations suggest that this effector is unlikely to be PKN. First Y42C, which cannot bind PKN, nevertheless induces stress fibres; second, F39L, which can bind PKN, does not co-operate with F39V to induce stress fibre formation; 1357 third, an activated derivative of PKN co-operates with neither F39V nor the activated ROCK mutant ROCK∆3 for stress fibre formation (see Figure 6). It has been proposed that p140mDia plays such a role (Watanabe et al., 1997), but all the mutants, including F39V, bind its relative mDia2, suggesting that proteins other than mDia– mDia2 may be involved. Our data do not rule out a role for Citron, and future experiments will address this possibility. Over-expression of the putative RhoA effector PI-4–P 5-kinase (Chong et al., 1994; Ren et al., 1996) can also induce cytoskeletal changes independently of RhoA (Shibasaki et al., 1997) and it will be interesting to examine the interaction of the mutants with this enzyme. Microinjection of NIH 3T3 cells with an expression plasmid encoding intact ROCK-I induced formation of actin fibres independently of RhoA, but these were fewer in number and thicker than those induced by RhoA.V14. In contrast, expression of the truncated ROCK∆3 mutant, which lacks the majority of ROCK-I C-terminal sequences, induced formation of thick actin spindles radiating from hub-like structures independent of functional RhoA. The observation that over-expression of ROCK-I induces structures distinct from those induced by RhoA.V14 is consistent with the idea that stress fibre formation requires both ROCK-I and additional effectors. Previous studies have disagreed as to the effects of over-expression of intact ROCK proteins upon the actin cytoskeleton, although they concur in the demonstration of efficient but aberrant actin reorganization by ROCK truncation mutants (Leung et al., 1996; Amano et al., 1997a; Ishizaki et al., 1997). In HeLa cells, over-expression of intact ROKα (ROCK-II) by microinjection was reported to induce identical structures to RhoA.V14 (Leung et al., 1996) while transfection experiments with ROCK-I demonstrated only limited fibre formation by the intact protein (Ishizaki et al., 1997). The reason for the discrepancy between these studies and the one reported here is unclear. A significant difference between studies performed with ROCK derivatives and those performed with RhoA effector mutants may be that in the latter studies stress fibre formation is dependent on activation of endogenous effectors. However, we cannot rule out effects due to different cell types, experimental conditions, or the use of different ROCK proteins. Regulation of SRF by RhoA Since microinjection assays allow direct comparison of the effects of RhoA on cytoskeletal reorganization and SRF activity, we used both microinjection and transfection assays to investigate SRF activation. Only mutants F39V and Y42C showed wild-type activity in both assays. Signalling to SRF by activated RhoA did not correlate directly with any of the effectors tested, suggesting that it requires an as yet uncharacterized effector(s), and can occur independently of effector kinases such as ROCK-I or PKN (Figure 6; Table II). For example, mutant F39A, which is defective for all effectors tested apart from mDia2, was still functional in both assays, albeit with reduced efficiency. The identity of RhoA codon 40 is critically important for RhoA-mediated SRF activation: mutant E40L was inactive in both assays, while E40W was inactive in transfection assays but weakly active in the microinjection assay.

For discussion see text. assay probably reflects both saturating levels of RhoA produced in the assay and the use of a simple positive/ negative system for the scoring of gene expression.) Cytoskeletal reorganization does not appear to be a prerequisite for SRF activation, since several mutants could activate SRF-controlled reporter genes without inducing stress fibre formation (Table II). It remains possible that SRF activation does require a functional cytoskeleton, but this is difficult to assess because agents that disrupt microtubules or actin filaments themselves trigger SRF activation (R.Treisman and C.S.Hill, unpublished observations). Over-expression of the PKN kinase domain did not potentiate SRF activity in our assays, although a modest activation of SRF by PRK2 has been reported by others (Quilliam et al., 1996). However, even though activation of SRF in our cells does not correlate directly with ROCKI binding, we found that ROCK∆3, a truncated ROCK-I derivative, weakly activated SRF reporter genes in Rhodependent manner. Although a similar finding was reported by others while this paper was under review, that study did not investigate its dependence on RhoA (Chihara et al., 1997). A trivial explanation for this is that activation of RhoA-mediated signalling pathways is a consequence of deregulated ROCK-I function; this is consistent with 1358 the observation that a specific ROCK inhibitor (Uehata et al., 1997) does not block serum-induced SRF activation a (E.Sahai, unpublished data). An alternative possibility, which we cannot exclude, is that ROCK-I either co-operates with or potentiates the activity of another RhoA effector to regulate SRF (Figure 6, dotted arrows). The lack of correlation between effector binding and function might either reflect the different conditions used for the functional and binding assays, or indirect effects of RhoA on effector function. The potential for such indirect effects is illustrated by the observations that GTP-bound RhoA binds both the myosin binding subunit (MBS), the regulatory subunit of myosin lightchain phosphatase, and ROCK-II, the kinase that phosphorylates MBS (Kimura et al., 1996); and that the association of RhoA with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) (Ren et al., 1996) may also indirectly regulate PKN by altering PI-4,5–P2 concentrations (Palmer et al., 1995). However, in microinjection experiments we have been unable to block F39V- or Y42C-induced SRF activation by expression of RhoA.N19, a dominant interfering mutant (E.Sahai, unpublished data). Further studies will be necessary to resolve this issue. Transforming ability of RhoA correlates with binding to ROCK-I Activated RhoA is able to promote loss of contact inhibition and subsequent formation of foci in NIH 3T3 cells in co-operation with activated Raf (Khosravi-Far et al., 1995; Prendergast et al., 1995; Qiu et al., 1995), and a number of Rho-family GEFs have been isolated as oncogenes (for review see Cerione and Zheng, 1996). Since focus formation assays involve the generation of stable cell clones, comparison with the short-term microinjection and transfection assays is difficult: RhoA.V14 transformed cells do not contain a higher level of stress fibres than their non-transformed counterparts (E.Sahai, unpublished data). We found the ability of effector mutants to induce focus formation did not correlate with SRF activation, as previously observed with Rac1 effector mutants (Westwick et al., 1997). Several other observations are consistent RhoA effector mutants with this. First, we found that the constitutively active SRF derivative SRF–VP16 did not co-operate with activated Raf in transformation assays; second, an intact lipid modification site in RhoB is required for transformation but not signalling to the SRE (Lebowitz et al., 1997); finally, while activated RhoA is sufficient to activate transfected or microinjected immediate–early gene promoters, in microinjection experiments it requires additional signals to activate chromosomal genes (Alberts et al., 1998a). The properties of the effector mutants show that transformation by RhoA correlates with the ability to bind ROCK rather than activate SRF. Mutants F39V, E40N, E40T and Y42C, all of which bind ROCK-I and mDia2 and activate the SRE, promote focus formation, but mutant F39A, which can also activate the SRE, does not. Transformation correlates with ROCK binding rather than stress fibre formation, since F39V transforms but fails to induce stress fibres. It is likely that activation of ROCK may not be sufficient for transformation, however, since the activated ROCK-I derivative ROCK∆3 does not cooperate with ∆NRaf in the focus formation assay. In contrast, it appears that transformation by Rac1 correlates neither with ROCK binding nor cytoskeletal reorganization (Joneson et al., 1996a; Lamarche et al., 1996; Westwick et al., 1997). Our data suggest that transformation by RhoA and the ability to remodel the cytoskeleton must be, at least to some extent, interdependent. It will be interesting to test whether the recently developed ROCK inhibitors (Uehata et al., 1997) can affect cellular transformation by derivatives of RhoA or its activators. Materials and methods Plasmids All DNA manipulations were carried out using standard protocols. pGBT9RhoA.V14/S190 was made by subcloning RhoA.V14 from EF.RhoA.V14 (Hill et al., 1995) into pGBT9 (EcoRI[blunt]–SalI into NcoI[blunt]–XhoI); in addition codon 190 was changed from C to S. PCR across codons 1–45 of RhoAV14 was used to randomize codons 37–40 of EFRhoAV14 (forward primer: TGCTTACATTTGCTTCTG, reverse primers: CTCGATATCTGCCACATAGTTCTCAAACACNNNGGGCAC, CTCGATATCTGCCACATAGTTCTCAAANNNTGTGGGCAC, CTCGATATCTGCCACATAGTTCTCNNNCACTGTGGG, CTCGATATCTGCCACATAGTTNNNAAACACTGTGGG). PCR products were cut using NcoI and EcoRV, subcloned into EFRhoA, and subsequently recloned into pGBT9RhoA.V14/S190 to generate pGBT9RhoAlibrary. PGAD–PKN, pGAD–PKN.N, pGAD–ROCK, pGAD–mDia2, pGAD–Kinectin and pGAD–NET are pGAD424 derivatives containing PKN codons 1–942 and 1–511, ROCK-I codons 348– 1018, mDia2 codons 47–800, Kinectin codons 1053–1327, and mNET codons 1–596; pVP16Citron and pVP16Rhophilin contain Citron codons 674–870 and Rhophilin codons 1–130, both with N-terminal HSV VP16 activation domains (Madaule et al., 1995; Watanabe et al., 1996). GST fusion proteins are described elsewhere (Alberts et al., 1998b). Yeast manipulations and effector mutant screen All yeast work was carried out using standard techniques. Transformation of Hf7C cells (Clontech) was done according to the supplier’s protocol. For plasmid rescue, 2 ml of exponential liquid cultures were pooled, pelleted, resuspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS), mixed with 3 ml of phenol:chloroform (1:1) and 4 g of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma, 425–600 µm), and vortexed for 2 min. After centrifugation, DNA was recovered from the aqueous phase by ethanol precipitation. PKN1/ROCK– mutant screen. Four hundred independent transformants carrying pGAD–PKN and pGBT9RhoAlibrary were screened for HIS3 expression, yielding 100 positive colonies (the RhoA–PKN interaction, 1359 while specific, does not activate lacZ expression sufficiently to use the colony colour assay). Thirty-one colonies were grown, pooled, and the pGBTRhoA plasmids rescued by retransformation into Escherichia coli DH5α following digestion with ClaI to linearize the pGAD–PKN plasmid. Bacterial transformants were pooled and retransformed into yeast carrying pGAD–ROCK-I(348–1018); 107 transformants were screened for lack of growth on plates lacking histidine and containing 1 mM aminotriazole. pGBT9RhoAlibrary plasmids were rescued from 36 positive colonies. ROCK1/PKN– mutant screen. Four hundred and two independent transformants carrying pGAD–ROCK-I(348–1018) and pGBT9- RhoAlibrary were screened for lacZ expression (strong blue colour within 3 h), and pGBT9RhoA plasmids were rescued from 68 positive clones. These were subsequently transformed into yeast carrying pGAD–PKN and rescreened for mutants unable to grow on plates lacking histidine. From 84 colonies screened, 16 positives were recovered and confirmed by retransformation into yeast before sequence analaysis to ascertain the mutant RhoA sequence. In vitro protein interaction assay Purification of GST fusion proteins and 9E10 epitope-tagged RhoA.V14 proteins and their loading with GTPγS was as described elsewhere (Alberts et al., 1998b). Following loading with GTPγS, 100 ng of RhoA protein were incubated with gentle agitation for 2 h at 10°C with ~1 µg of either GST–PKN(1–511), GST–mDia2(47–257), or GST–ROCK-I (831–1011), immobilized on gluthione–Sepharose (Pharmacia), in 200 µl of 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 125 µg/ml BSA, containing protease inhibitors. Beads were then washed once in PBS, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, once in 50 mM Tris– HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl (or 100 mM NaCl, 70 mM LiCl for ROCK-I binding assays), 5 mM MgCl2, and finally in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2. RhoA proteins that remained bound to the beads were eluted by boiling in SDS–PAGE loading buffer, fractionated on 15% gels and detected by immunoblot with 9E10 antibody. Microinjection and immunofluorescence NIH-3T3 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips 48 h before injection and maintained in E4–0.5% FCS for 24 h prior to injection. Injections were done on a Zeiss 5171 semi-automated machine using pulled glass capillaries. All DNAs were injected into the cell nucleus at 50 ng/µl, except for EFC3 (25 ng/µl) and the RhoA expression plasmids (100 ng/µl), together with guinea-pig marker IgG at 5 µg/µl. Cells were harvested 5 h after injection. Serum stimulation was with 15% FCS 1 h before harvesting. Cells were fixed in fresh 4% HCHO in PBS for 15 min followed by extraction in PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100. Antibodies were diluted 1:100 in PBS 1 5% donkey serum and the cells were washed four times in PBS after antibody incubations and prior to mounting. Antibodies used were as follows: 9E10 (gift G.Evan), Y-11 (Santa Cruz), anti-rabbit-Texas Red or -FITC, anti-mouse-FITC or -AMCA, anti-guinea-pig-AMCA (all Jackson/Stratech, UK), and also TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma). Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope and Smart Capture system (Vysis, UK) and processed as PICT files using Adobe Photoshop. Transformation and reporter gene assays For transformation assays, NIH 3T3 cells (a gift from Chris Marshall) were seeded at 23105 per 35 mm well in E4 with 10% donor calf serum (DCS). For transfection, 1 µg of plasmid DNA in 100 µl of Optimem (GibcoBRL) was added to 108 µl Lipofectamine mix (100:8 Optimem: Lipofectamine; GibcoBRL) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For transfection cells were washed once with Optimem and the medium replaced with 800 µl of Optimem; the DNA mix was then added and the cells incubated at 37°C, 10% CO2 for 5 h, following which the DNA mix was replaced with E4 1 10% DCS. After 24 h, the cells were trypsinized, transferred to 100-mm dishes, and maintained in E4 1 10% DCS for 3 days, following which they were maintained in E4 1 5% DCS for a further 12 days before staining for foci with 0.5% Crystal Violet in PBS–10% v/v methanol. For reporter gene assays NIH 3T3 cells grown on 60-mm dishes were transfected as above except that all quantities were doubled, and cells were maintained in E4 1 0.5% DCS for 48 h. Harvesting, CAT assays and immunoblots were carried out as described previously (Hill et al., 1995).  
2274||The majority of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cases are characterized by the presence of a promyelocytic leukemia–retinoic acid receptor alpha(RARA) fusion gene. In a small subset, RARA is fused to a different partner, usually involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation. Here, we identified a novel RARA fusion transcript, BCOR-RARA, in a t(X;17)(p11;q12) variant of APL with unique morphologic features, including rectangular and round cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Although the patient was clinically responsive to all-trans retinoic acid, several relapses occurred with standard chemotherapy and all-trans retinoic acid. BCOR is a transcriptional corepressor through the proto-oncoprotein, BCL6, recruiting histone deacetylases and polycomb repressive complex 1 components. BCOR-RARA was found to possess common features with other RARA fusion proteins. These included: (1) the same break point in RARA cDNA; (2) selfassociation; (3) retinoid X receptor alpha is necessary for BCOR-RARA to associate with the RARA responsive element; (4) action in a dominant-negative manner on RARA transcriptional activation; and (5) aberrant subcellular relocalization. It should be noted that there was no intact BCOR found in the 45,-Y,t(X;17)(p11;q12) APL cells because they featured only a rearranged X chromosome. These results highlight essential features of pathogenesis in APL in more detail. BCOR appears to be involved not only in human congenital diseases, but also in a human cancer. (Blood. 2010;116(20):4274-4283) Introduction Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a distinct disease entity within the acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).1-3 In the clinic, APL has characteristic morphologic features, including hypergranular promyelocytes, and exhibits a severe bleeding tendency, which is efficiently controlled with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment.4 The majority of APLs feature a balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 15q22 and 17q12, which results in the fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) genes.5 In rare cases, other fusion partners of RARA are found, such as promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF),6 nucleophosmin (NPM1),7 nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA),8 signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b,9 protein kinase A regulatory subunit type 1A,10 and Fip1-like 1.11 All of the RARA fusion proteins comprise all but the first 30 amino acids of RARA fused to a variable partner at its aminoterminus.1-3 It is characteristic that all fusion partners have self-association domains. In the case of PML-RARA and PLZF-RARA, aberrant recruitment of transcriptional repressors, including nuclear corepressor protein/silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (NCOR/SMRT), histone deacetylases (HDACs),12,13 and polycomb complexes,14,15 to the retinoic acid responsive element (RARE) leads to ectopic repression of RAR target genes.1,2 In mouse models of RARA fusion proteins, APL-like diseases occur after a long latency, presumably because of the requirement for other cooperative genetic events for overt APL.16 Hence, other mechanisms for leukemogenesis of APL have been advocated, such as the double dominant-negative activity of PML-RARA, which also interferes with a remaining tumor suppressor, PML.1,2 The BCL6 corepressor, BCOR,17 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein, which directly interfaces to proto-oncoprotein BCL6 through the BCOR-BCL6–binding domain (BCORBBD).18 BCOR also associates with HDACs, the polycomb group protein, Polycomb group RING finger protein 1/nervous system polycomb 1 (PCGF1/NSPC1), and the histone demethylase, F-box– and leucine-rich repeat protein 10 (FBXL10), through its C-terminal region,19,20 which implies that it could suppress gene transcription by epigenetic mechanisms.21,22 Recently, it was reported that BCOR is critical for early embryonic development, mesenchymal stem cell function, primitive erythroid differentiation, and lymphoid cell differentiation.22,23 Moreover, BCOR gene mutations have been linked with human inherited diseases—the oculofaciocardiodental and lenz microphthalmia syndromes.24 Here, we report that BCOR is a novel fusion partner of RARA in a variant APL patient with 45,-Y,t(X;17)(p11;q12). The patient demonstrated overt coagulopathy and sensitivity to ATRA, but resistance to arsenic trioxide. The APL cells showed a unique morphology with round inclusions and rectangular cytoplasmic bodies. Dissection of the pathogenesis of such a variant of APL with BCOR-RARA might reveal significant aspects of molecular mechanisms underlying human leukemias. Methods Case report The patient was a 45-year-old man who was admitted because of fever, dyspnea, and bloody phlegm.

For personal use only. of 12.1 g/dL, a white blood cell count of 25.3   109/L, including 59% promyelocytes, and a platelet count of 116   109/L. A bone marrow sample was markedly hypercellular, containing 83% promyelocytes. Reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis failed to detect PML-RARA fusion transcripts from the bone marrow cells. However, coagulopathy was present, with an increased prothrombin time of 1.58 (international normalized ratio), an activated partial thromboplastin time of 33.7 seconds (normal, 26  39), decreased fibrinogen of 52 mg/dL (200  400), and mildly increased fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products of 50.6 mg/L (0  5). Diagnosis of a variant of APL was made according to the morphology, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and flow cytometric analysis [human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR)/CD13 / CD33 /CD56 ] (Figure 1, supplemental Figure 1 and supplemental Table 1, available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). Remission induction therapy was commenced following a Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group APL204 protocol with ATRA (45 mg/m2/d), idarubicin (12 mg/m2/d from days 1 to 3), and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C; 100 mg/m2/d from days 1 to 7). A complete remission (CR) was documented on day 27 with reference to morphology, cytogenetics, and FISH. A set of consolidation therapies was administered as follows: first course, mitoxantrone 7 mg/m2   3 days and Ara-C 200 mg/m2   5 days; second course, daunorubicin 50 mg/m2   3 days and Ara-C 200 mg/m2   5 days; and third course, idarubicin 12 mg/m2   3 days and Ara-C 140 mg/m2   5 days. Thirty-five months after diagnosis, the patient relapsed with gradually reducing blood counts and overt coagulopathy. A bone marrow sample showed that 90% of the cells were leukemic blasts with the recurring chromosomal translocation, FISH abnormality of RARA, and aberrant expression of CD56 and CD13. A second remission induction therapy, which was the same regimen at the diagnosis, was administered. A second CR was documented on day 32. Two cycles of consolidation therapy were administered. At 41 months after diagnosis, the patient had a second relapse. Arsenic trioxide (0.15 mg/kg) was administered for 16 days, but no response occurred. Then, tamibarotene (6 mg/kg) was given,25 which mildly reduced the leukemia burden. After single chemotherapy with daunorubicin and Ara-C, a cord-blood transplantation was performed with a myeloablative conditioning regimen. After engraftment was achieved, a bone marrow sample showed a third CR. Cell lines, reagents, and antibodies. A human AML cell line, EOL1, was maintained in RPMI 1640 (SigmaAldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Equitech-Bio) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. 293T and HepG2 were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Antibodies used were as follows: FLAG (M2; Sigma-Aldrich), Myc (PL14; MBL), BCL6 (N-3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and alpha-tubulin (B-7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cytogenetic studies Karyotype analysis was performed with regular G-banding by trypsin and Giemsa staining banding (SRL). The Vysis LSI PML/RARA dual-color, dual-fusion translocation probe was used for FISH analysis (Vysis). PML signals were red, and RARA signals were green. The RARA probe covered up to 700-kb pairs, sufficient to surround the RARA gene on 17q12. Figure 1. Morphology and cytogenetic analysis of a bone marrow sample of t(X;17)(p11;q12) APL.

BLOOD, 18 NOVEMBER 2010   VOLUME 116, NUMBER 20 BCOR-RARA IN t(X;17)(p11;q12) APL 4275 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 27, 2017. For personal use only. Cloning of BCOR-RARA fusion transcripts Rapid 5  amplification of cDNA ends (5 -RACE) was performed with a SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Clinical samples were collected under institutional review board–approved protocols and with written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Briefly, total RNA from bone marrow nuclear cells before treatment was isolated with an RNeasy plus mini kit (QIAGEN). One microgram of the total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with the 5 -coding sequence primer A. A first polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the cDNA was performed with the universal primer A mix and RAe3R (5 -GCAAGGCTTGTAGATGCGGGGTAGA-3 ), followed by nested PCR with the nested universal primer A and R8R (5 -CAGAACTGCTGCTCTGGGTCTCAAT-3 ).26 The PCR products were purified and directly sequenced (ABI 3100; Applied Biosystems). RT-PCR The patient’s cDNA and EOL1 cDNA as a control were subjected to PCR with the following primers: RARA: first PCR R18F (5 - TGGACAGCAGCTCCAGGACA-3 )/R5R (5 -CCCATAGTGGTAGCCTGAGGACT-3 ), followed by nested PCR R19F (5 -CTGTCTAGATGCCAGACTGTCTGCCTC-3 )2 6/RAe3R; BCOR: BR12F1 (5 -CTCTGCACGATGCTGTTGAGAACGA-3 )/BR13R1 (5 - GAGCTGCCATAGAAGTCCCAAGTGC-3 ); BCOR-RARA: BR12F1/ R5R; and RARA-BCOR: first PCR R18F/BR13R1 was followed by nested PCR R19F/ BR13R2 (5 -CATCATTGCGACCCTGGAGGTCATT-3 ). All PCR reactions were accomplished under the following conditions. Denaturing, annealing, and extension steps were performed at 95°C for 30 seconds, 58°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute, respectively, for 30 cycles on a PCR thermal cycler (Dice; TaKaRa). For long-distance RT-PCR, we used TaKaLa LA-Taq and the following primers: 5 -BCOR-RARA: BR2F1 (5 -AGACGCTTGAAGCAAAGCTGCCATC-3 )/RAe3R; and 3 -BCOR-RARA: BR12F1/RAUTR (5 - AGTTCTGAGGATGGGGGAGCCAAGT-3 ). Touchdown PCR was achieved as denaturing and extension steps were performed at 94°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 6 minutes, respectively. Annealing steps were 70°C for 30 seconds from the 6th to 10th cycles and 68°C for 30 seconds from the 11th to 30th cycles. Plasmid construction Full-length cDNAs of RARA, RXRA, BCOR, BCL6, PML-RARA, and BCOR-RARA were amplified from total RNA of bone marrow samples with Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes). After sequence validation, each cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Either a Myc (EQKLISEEDL) or a FLAG (DYKDDDDK) tag was fused to the aminotermini of BCOR and BCOR-RARA, or the carboxytermini of RARA, RXRA, BCL6, and PML-RARA by PCR. (See Figure 3A for composition of the deletion mutants.) Coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis For coimmunoprecipitation, expression plasmids of Myc- or FLAG-tagged proteins were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) into 293T. After 48 hours of incubation, cells were harvested, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris [tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane]-HCl (pH 7.4), 1mM EDTA (ethylenedimainetetraacetic acid), 1% Triton X-100, and PhosSTOP (Roche) on ice for 20 minutes. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected. Then, 40  L of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the lysates and incubated at 4°C for 2 hours. The affinity gels were washed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by incubation with 50  L of 3  FLAG peptide solution (0.5 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) on ice for 30 minutes. For immunoblotting analysis, extracted proteins were separated in 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate– polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) at 8 V/cm for 4 hours in Towbin buffer (25mM Tris and 192mM glycine; pH 8.3). The membranes were sequentially incubated with 5% skimmed milk, primary antibodies at a 1:2000 dilution, and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at a 1:5000 dilution. Then, the membranes were incubated for chemiluminescence (Luminol Reagent; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and proteins were detected by X-ray film exposure. The films were visualized with a PCX-101 (Konica Minolta). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) In vitro translated proteins were produced by T7 priming with the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). Protein expression was confirmed by 35S-methionine incorporation according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Oligonucleotides of the RARE-containing DR5G sequence27 were annealed to form a double-stranded probe, radiolabeled with 32P by Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), and purified through a G-25 Sephadex column (Roche). An equal amount of in vitro translated proteins was incubated on ice for 15 minutes with the radiolabeled probes (20 000 cpm) and 1  g of poly-dI-dC (Sigma-Aldrich) in binding buffer containing 10mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10mM MgCl2, and 1mM 1,4-dithioerythritol or with the addition of a 100-fold excess of unradiolabeled probes and anti-RARAantibody to the mixture. Then, the mixture was loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.5% Tris-borate–EDTA buffer. The gels were air dried with a Promega gel drying kit, followed by X-ray film exposures at 80°C overnight before visualization. Transcription reporter assay The pcDNA3 expression vectors, 4 times repeats of RARE (DR5G) containing pGL4.26 reporter vector (Promega) and pRL-TK for transfection efficiency control, were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells with Fugene HD (Roche). In addition, ATRA was added at the same time. After 48 hours of incubation, transfected cells were lysed and incubated with Dual-Luciferase Reporter reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase activity was analyzed with ARVO X (PerkinElmer) and normalized to the Renilla activity. The results were the means of triplicate wells and representative of 3 independent experiments. The input proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunofluorescence analysis and microscopy 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids. The cells were fixed for 30 minutes in methanol at 20°C. Primary antibodies at a 1:50 dilution were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Secondary antibodies at a 1:200 dilution, including donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulin –Alexa Fluor 488 and donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin–Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes), were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Vector Laboratories). Confocal laser images were captured with an Olympus BX51 microscope. The original magnification was  400 for all panels. Results Unique morphologic and cytogenetic features of t(X;17)(p11;q12) APL blasts, distinct from typical AML M3 or M3 variants Bone marrow promyelocytes were strongly positive for Sudan black B, myeloperoxidase staining (Figure 1), and naphthol AS-D chloroacetate staining and negative for alpha-naphthyl butyrate staining (data not shown). They were more granular than those of AML M2, but less granular than the classical t(15;17) APL.28 Round inclusions and rectangular cytoplasmic bodies were remarkable morphologic features, instead of typical Auer bodies and faggot cells (Figure 1). Round inclusions have been reported in variants of APL,28 but such rectangular cytoplasmic bodies have not been previously described. They were found positive for periodic acid–Schiff staining (supplemental Figure 1A), suggesting that the cytoplasmic bodies were a kind of polysaccharide. Some 4276 YAMAMOTO et al BLOOD, 18 NOVEMBER 2010   VOLUME 116, NUMBER 20 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 27, 2017. For personal use only. leukemia cells showed that the cytoplasm was filled with deposits, and inclusion bodies were forming (supplemental Figure 1B). Moreover, crystallized cytoplasmic bodies were found (supplemental Figure 1C). In a rare leukemia cell population, Auer-like bodies were found (Figure 1B). These results indicated that aberrant deposits could crystallize in the cytoplasm, which were distinct from those found in the classical t(15;17) APL. In this case, the nuclei were regular in shape without the bilobed grooving, which resemble the nuclei of t(11;17)-associated APL.28 Flow cytometric analysis revealed strong expression of CD13, CD33, and CD56, weak expression of CD11c, and lack of HLA-DR and CD7 (supplemental Table 1). This expression pattern is reminiscent of APL harboring PLZF-RARA.28 FLT3–internal tandem duplication was not detected (data not shown). Karyotype analysis detected a novel chromosomal translocation described as 45,-Y, t(X;17)(p11.2; q12)[19]/ 46,XY[1] (Figure 1E). FISH analysis indicated 1 intact and 2 split signals of RARA and 2 intact signals of PML (Figure 1F). These results confirmed t(X;17)(p11;q12) APL blasts to be distinct from typical AML M3 or M3 variants. Molecular cloning of BCOR-RARA fusion transcripts in t(X;17)(p11;q12) The FISH analysis suggested that one RARA gene was rearranged because the RARA probe covered the entire RARA gene spanning from the 5 - to the 3 -untranslated region. To amplify unknown chimeric fusion transcripts, we performed 5 -RACE, and PCR products derived from the patient bone marrow cells were directly sequenced, revealing BCOR cDNA from exons 9 to 12 to be fused to RARA exon 3 (Figure 2A). By RT-PCR, we confirmed full-length chimeric fusion transcripts spanning from the start codon to 4948 nt of BCOR cDNA (isoform b; reference NM_001123384) fused to RARA cDNA from exon 3 to the stop codon (Figure 2D). The chimeric cDNA had an in-frame codon from BCOR through RARA, creating a 1931 amino acid (aa) fusion protein described as BCOR-RARA (Figure 2B). A reciprocal chimeric cDNA of RARA-BCOR was not detected (Figure 2C). The BCORRARAhad a BCORBBD (498  514 aa), 3 ankyrin repeats (1410  1509 aa) of BCOR, a DNA-binding domain (DBD) derived from RARA (1557  1622 aa), and a ligand-binding domain of RARA (1669  1888 aa; Figure 2B).3,17,18 Identification of self-association of BCOR-RARA One of the consistent features in all known RARA fusion partners is self-association.2,3 So far, there has been no report that BCOR is able to self-associate. To determine whether BCOR and/or BCORRARA self-associate, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays. Consistent with other RARA fusion partners,2,3 Myc-tagged (Mt)-BCOR coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged (Ft)-BCOR (Figure 3B). Subsequently, we confirmed that Mt-BCOR-RARA Figure 2.

For personal use only. also coimmunoprecipitated with Ft-BCOR-RARA. To further investigate which domains of BCOR contribute to the selfassociation property, we created a set of deletion mutants of BCOR (Figure 3A). Huynh et al previously described that there are 2 transcripts as full-length BCOR and a variant form (BCOR-S).17 As shown in Figure 3B, BCOR-S and NBC-RARA retained the self-association. Surprisingly, CBC-RARA also retained the selfassociation property. Furthermore, AR-RARA containing AR still possessed the self-association, but with dNRARA, it was lost. These results showed that BCOR-RARA is able to self-associate both through the BCOR-S region and the ankyrin-repeat domain of BCOR. Moreover, BCL6 interacts with BCOR through BCORBBD (Figure 2B).18 We also confirmed that BCOR-RARA associates with BCL6 (Figure 3C). The BCOR-RARA/RXRA complex, but not BCOR-RARA by itself, associates with the RARE RXR recruitment is a critical determinant of transforming the potential of oligomeric RARA fusion proteins.29,30 In addition, RARA fusion proteins gain alternative abilities to associate with RARE.31 To investigate how BCOR-RARA associates with RARE in vitro, we performed EMSA. In the absence of RXRA, PMLRARA associated with DR5G RARE by itself, but BCOR-RARA, CBC-RARA, BCOR, and BCOR-S did not (Figure 4B left). In addition, it was considered that AR-RARA, dNRARA, and RARA faintly associate with RARE. In the presence of RXRA, however, RARA, BCOR-RARA, and the deletion mutants could synergistically associate with RARE (Figure 4B middle). To further confirm that BCOR-RARA deletion mutants lose association with RARE in the absence of RXRA, 4-fold increased input proteins were subjected to EMSA. As shown in Figure 4C, RARA, AR-RARA, and dNRARA clearly interacted with RARE, as verified by addition of anti-RARA antibody inducing supershift. In contrast, CBC-RARA completely lost the interaction with RARE in the absence of RXRA. These data supported the conclusion that RXRA is necessary for BCOR-RARA to associate with RARE, and showed that the BCOR-RARA/RXRA complex associates with at least DR5G RARE in an alternative manner, compared with RARA and PML-RARA. BCOR-RARA inhibits ATRA-induced RARA transcriptional activation in a dominant-negative manner Deregulation of RARA transcriptional activations has a central role in the pathogenesis of APL. BCOR-RARA and other RARA fusion proteins invariably retain the ability to associate with RARE in the presence of RXRA, which potentially could interfere with RAR/ RXR pathways. Therefore, we evaluated ATRA-induced transcriptional activation of 4   RAREs with a reporter assay in HepG2 cells. At first, we assessed the basal transcriptional activation of a sample with RXRA (Figure 5B). Without ATRA, BCOR-RARA repressed the reporter activity, compared with mock control. With addition of 1 M of ATRA, BCOR-RARA induced transcriptional activation very weakly. However, addition of ATRA did not robustly induce transcriptional activation of PML-RARA, BCORRARA, NBC-RARA, CBC-RARA, and dARBR, compared with RARA. In contrast, AR-RARA showed partial transcriptional activation between dNRARA and dARBR. In addition, we con- firmed that BCOR and other deletion mutants did not influence Renilla transcriptional activity because BCOR is a transcriptional repressor (supplemental Figure 2). Subsequently, we evaluated the dominant-negative effects of samples in the RARA/RXRA pathway. RARA and RXRA were cotransfected with mock, PMLRARA, BCOR-RARA, or deletion mutants. In contrast to BCOR and BC112, BCOR-RARA obviously inhibited ATRA-induced RARA transcriptional activation as well as PML-RARA (Figure 5C). Furthermore, we asked which domains are sufficient for dominant-negative effects with the deletion mutants. Although AR-RARA had reduced ATRA-induced transcriptional activation Figure 3.

Interestingly, CBC-RARA suppressed RARA transcriptional activation equivalent to BCORRARA. These results indicated that the region spanning from 999 to 1409 aa of BCOR-RARA has pivotal roles in the dominantnegative effects. Figure 4.

BLOOD, 18 NOVEMBER 2010   VOLUME 116, NUMBER 20 BCOR-RARA IN t(X;17)(p11;q12) APL 4279 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 27, 2017. For personal use only. Subcellular localization of BCOR-RARA/BCL6 is distinct from BCOR/BCL6 Correct protein function is highly dependent on intracellular localization. For instance, aberrant subcellular localization of PML-RARA disrupts PML localization within nuclear bodies and delocalizes PML in a microspeckled nuclear pattern mediated through self-association between PML-RARA and PML. In addition, PML-RARA interacts with RXRA, potentially deregulating retinoid signaling by sequestering RXRA from normal compartments.2,3 To investigate the subcellular localization of BCORRARA, we performed immunofluorescence analysis in 293T cells. As previously reported, PML-RARA was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm (data not shown).32 In BCOR-RARA–expressing cells, BCOR-RARA localized as 2 patterns: (1) diffusely in the nucleus as well as PML-RARA in 82% of the cells and (2) diffusely in the nucleus and aggregately in the cytoplasm in 18% of the cells (Figure 6B). The subcellular localization of BCOR-RARA was clearly distinguishable from the punctuate pattern shown in the nucleus of BCOR-expressing cells.17 Although functions of BCL6 in myeloid cells are largely unknown, the expression of BCL6 is robustly induced in granulocytic differentiation.33 To further investigate aberrant localizations of BCOR-related proteins, we performed coimmunofluorescence analysis between BCOR-RARA and BCL6 in 293T cells. As shown in Figure 6B, BCL6 colocalized with BCOR in the nucleus as the punctuate pattern, but did not colocalize with PML-RARA. Interestingly, BCL6 clearly colocalized with BCOR-RARA and relocalized in aberrant subcellular compartments. These results indicated that the subcellular localization of BCOR-RARA/BCL6 is distinct from that of BCOR/BCL6. Discussion To our knowledge, this is a first report of a novel variant of APL with t(X;17)(p11;q12). The classical APL with PML-RARA typically has hypergranular leukemic promyelocytes with Auer bodies and/or faggot cells and bilobed grooved nuclei.28 In the present case, round inclusions and rectangular cytoplasmic bodies were remarkable morphologic features, instead of Auer bodies. Such round inclusions have previously been reported in cases of NPM1-RARA and PLZF-RARA.28 The morphologic features, including a regular shaped nucleus and less granular cytoplasm than classical APL, were in fact reminiscent of APL with PLZFRARA.28 This unique profile of leukemia cells might reflect the presence of BCOR-RARA. The clinical course indicated that coagulopathy on diagnosis could be relieved by administration of ATRA and tamibarotene (synthetic retinoid)25 but not arsenic trioxide. Leukemia cell differentiation was also accomplished with ATRA and tamibarotene. The resistance to arsenic trioxide in this patient was reminiscent of a PLZF-RARA case,34 which can be explained by the fact that arsenic trioxide induces apoptosis by PML-mediated sumoylation.35 Even though the patient was sensitive to retinoic acids, relapse occurred several times, and allogeneic myeloablative transplantation was needed to eradicate the leukemia cells.

For personal use only. APL is a rare subtype with PML-RARA, PLZF-RARA, or unknown chromosomal alterations.36 The CD56  APL failed to differentiate in vitro in response to ATRA and prognosis of the CD56  APL is poor, compared with that of the classical APL.36,37 Our patient was classified as a CD56  APL subtype, in agreement with the resistance to repeated standard chemotherapy with ATRA. FISH analysis with dual fusion translocation probes is useful to detect unknown rearrangements of the RARA gene.10 Initially, we failed to detect any karyotype abnormality by regular G-banding and FISH analysis with a PML-RARA dual-color probe, only detecting the 3  region of the RARA gene (Vysis; data not shown). However, use of a PML-RARA dual fusion translocation probe allowed us to detect a novel rearrangement of the RARA gene. On retrospective reanalysis of the karyotype with G-banding, t(X; 17)(p11;q12) was detected. Moreover, spectral karyotyping analysis confirmed that other subtle karyotype abnormalities did not exist in this case (data not shown). For cloning of the fusion transcripts, we used 5 -RACE. The transcripts were, fortunately, short, spanning from BCOR exon 9 to RARA. Long-distance PCR confirmed that there was a full-length BCOR-RARA fusion transcript without any alternative splicing. On the other hand, a reciprocal fusion transcript encoding RARA-BCOR was not detected. Although reciprocal fusion transcripts of RARA-PLZF could play roles in the pathogenesis of rare APLs,38,39 reciprocal fusion transcripts of RARA-PML have been found to be missing in 20%-30% of major APL cases.3 This means the presence of reciprocal fusion proteins is not always indispensable for transformation in APL. BCOR is a transcriptional corepressor through the protooncoprotein, BCL6.17,40 In diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 3q27 chromosomal translocations involving BCL6 are found in approximately 40% of cases.40 BCL6 acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting NCOR/SMRT, mammalian Sin3A, and HDAC1.40 BCOR is a ubiquitously expressed protein originally identified as associating with BCL6.17 BCOR augments BCL6 transcriptional repression by interacting with class I and II HDACs and, potentially, with PCGF1 and FBXL10.17,19,20 PCGF1 is highly homologous with BMI1, which is associated with PLZF-RARA as a repressive chromatin-modification factor.15,21 The association between BCORRARA and PCGF1 is functionally coincident with evidence that PCGF1 also acts as a transcriptional repressor of p21Waf1/Cip1 via RARE, which is competitive with RARA/RXR in RA-pathway activation.41 To investigate whether BCOR-RARA associates with PCGF1, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay (data not shown). As we expected, BCOR-RARA coimmunoprecipitated with PCGF1 in 293T cells. Nevertheless, these results do not preclude the possibility that the association may be indirect. Since BCOR is a ubiquitously expressed protein, the association between BCOR-RARA and PCGF1 might be mediated through binding to endogenous BCOR. The self-association domains in known RARA fusion partners are the most conserved features.2 In BCOR-RARA, the domain accounting for self-association has yet to be defined, but we here obtained evidence that BCOR also self-associates, as well as BCOR-RARA, both through the ankyrin repeat domain of BCOR and the region of BCOR-S. Nearly 6% of eukaryotic protein sequences contain AR domains, which consist of several repeats and function in protein-protein binding.42 The AR domain of BCOR lent itself to self-association as well as that reported for transient receptor potential vanilloid 6 and signal-recognition particle 43.43,44 On the other hand, the domains responsible for the self-association mediated with the region of BCOR-S remain to be investigated. Although the self-association feature is conserved among all RARA fusion proteins, its exact roles in transformation in vivo are still controversial.29 Two recent reports indicated that RXR recruitment is a critical determinant of transforming potential in vivo of oligomeric RARA fusion proteins. The results are consistent with our finding that RXRA is necessary for BCOR-RARA to associate with RARE. In the reporter assay, BCOR-RARA acted in a dominant-negative manner as well as PML-RARA (Figure 5C). This is reasonable, because BCOR-RARA is associated with ectopic transcriptional repressors BCL6 and PCGF1 and, potentially, recruits HDACs. Interestingly, CBC-RARA proved suffi- cient to induce dominant-negative effects. These results suggest that critical transcriptional repressors might be recruited through the region from 999 to 1409 aa of BCOR. Current dogma holds that PLZF-RARA fails to respond to ATRA because of the RAinsensitive recruitment of NCOR, SMRT, Sin3A, and HDACs to the PLZF-RARA N-terminus.12 Although BCOR-RARA also contains an N-terminal corepressor binding site, the patient’s blasts apparently differentiated in response to ATRA. The difference in ATRA sensitivity might be explained by variation in corepressors. Precise mapping of corepressor binding sites more than BCL6 remains to be investigated to explain this issue. RARA fusion to other partners is able to alter binding site specificity.31 In contrast to other RARA fusion proteins,27,45-47 RXRA is necessary for BCORRARA association with RARE. The results potentially suggest that the binding-site specificity of BCOR-RARA might be different from those of other RARA fusion proteins, but this remains to be further elucidated in hematopoietic progenitor cells. While the deregulation of RARA transcriptional activation has a central role for the pathogenesis of APL, other cooperative genetic events are still needed for full-blown transformation.1,16 For instance, PML-RARA is regarded as a dominant-negative mutant for both RARA and PML pathways.1 Indeed, when PML-RARA is expressed in PML-null marrow, leukemogenesis is accelerated.48 To date, there have been no reports that BCOR acts as a tumor suppressor. It is noteworthy that a monoallelic deletion of BCOR was recently found in a male case of AML M7 by genomewide copy-number analysis.49 Because the patient presented here also did not have an intact BCOR, it could be that loss of BCOR is as significant for the pathology of the leukemia as the fact that BCOR is fused to RARA. Another gain-of-function phenotype of BCORRARA is relocalization (Figure 6). Other RARA fusion proteins, including PML-RARA and NuMA-RARA, localize in the nucleus/ cytoplasm and cytoplasm, respectively.32 The relocalization of BCOR-RARA is consistent with aberrant localization of PMLRARA.32 This feature is able to sequester BCOR-associated proteins, including BCL6, from normal compartments. To date, substantial functions of BCL6 in myeloid malignancies have not been well investigated, and BCL6 transcripts are preferentially detected in differentiated AML, including APL, AML M4, and M5.50 The aberrant relocalization of BCOR-associated proteins potentially cooperates in the leukemogenesis of t(X;17)- associated APL. In summary, we here identified BCOR-RARA fusion transcripts in a t(X;17)(p11;q12) variant of APL with unique cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Although the patient was clinically responsive to ATRA, repeated standard chemotherapy did not effect a cure. BCOR-RARA could be shown to possess common features with other RARA fusion proteins, such as: (1) the same break point in RARA cDNA, (2) self-association, (3) RXRA is necessary for BLOOD, 18 NOVEMBER 2010   VOLUME 116, NUMBER 20 BCOR-RARA IN t(X;17)(p11;q12) APL 4281 From www.bloodjournal.org by guest on May 27, 2017.

2275||Endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) are genetically heterogeneous uterine tumors in which a JAZF1-SUZ12 chimeric gene resulting from the chromosomal translocation t(7;17)(p15;q21) as well as PHF1 rearrangements (in chromosomal band 6p21) with formation of JAZF1-PHF1, EPC1-PHF1, and MEAF6-PHF1 chimeras have been described. Here, we investigated two ESS characterized cytogenetically by the presence of a der(22)t(X;22)(p11;q13). Whole transcriptome sequencing one of the tumors identified a ZC3H7-BCOR chimeric transcript. Reverse transciptase-PCR with the ZC3H7B forward and BCOR reverse primer combinations confirmed the presence of a ZC3H7-BCOR chimeric transcript in both ESS carrying a der(22)t(X;22) but not in a control ESS with t(1;6) and the MEAF6-PHF1 fusion. Sequencing of the amplified cDNA fragments showed that in both cases ESS exon 10 of ZC3H7B (from 22q13; accession number NM_017590 version 4) was fused to exon 8 of BCOR (from Xp11; accession number NM_001123385 version 1). Reciprocal multiple BCOR-ZC3H7B cDNA fragments were amplified in only one case suggesting that ZC3H7B-BCOR, on the der(22)t(X;22), is the pathogenetically important fusion gene. The putative ZC3H7B-BCOR protein would contain the tetratricopeptide repeats and LD motif from ZC3H7B and the AF9 binding site (1093-1233aa), the 3 ankyrin repeats (1410-1509 aa), and the NSPC1 binding site of BCOR. Although the presence of these motifs suggests various functions of the chimeric protein, it is possible that its most important role may be in epigenetic regulation. Whether or not the (patho)genetic subsets JAZF1-SUZ12, PHF1 rearrangements, and ZC3H7B-BCOR correspond to any phenotypic, let alone clinically important, differences in ESS remain unknown. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. INTRODUCTION  All neoplasms that have been analyzed in detail show nonrandom acquired genetic rearrangements (Heim and Mitelman, 2009). Many of the recurrent changes are with remarkable specificity associated with distinct tumor subtypes. Molecular studies of cancer-associated chromosomal rearrangements, in particular translocations, have shown that they often exert their action through deregulation, usually overexpression, of a gene in one breakpoint or creation of a chimeric or fusion gene through melting together of parts of two genes, one in each breakpoint (Heim and Mitelman, 2009). The first mechanism is common in lymphoid malignancies whereas the second one, i.e., the formation of fusion genes, occurs widely in hematological disorders, malignant lymphomas, and solid tumors. Because the chromosomal rearrangement leading to a fusion gene is often seen as the sole aberration at cytogenetic analysis, it is assumed to be a primary tumorigenic event. Hence, valuable insights into the origin of neoplasms may be gained from identifying fusion genes and studying their effects on cellular processes.  The methodology developed during the last two decades to detect fusion genes in tumors starts with cytogenetic analysis of tumor cells to identify a characteristic chromosomal rearrangement including mapping of the translocation breakpoints to a distinct band on each chromosome (Schichman and Croce, 1995). The second step has been the utilization of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques on abnormal metaphase plates using various and numerous probes such as BACs, PACs, and Fosmids to find the probe that spans the chromosomal breakpoint (the signal for this probe will be split between the two derivative chromosomes). The third step involves molecular cloning to localize the breakpoint more precisely and identify the genes fused by the chromosomal rearrangement. Although laborious, the above-mentioned sequential approach is quite robust and reliable, and a plethora of fusion genes have been cloned by such means (Heim and Mitelman, 2009). Among other malignancies, we have applied it on endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) with cytogenetic aberrations involving chromosome arm 6p and found that PHF1, which maps to chromosome band 6p21, is rearranged and fused as the 3′-partner gene to JAZF1 (on 7p15) in tumors showing a 6p;7p-translocation (JAZF1-PHF1 fusion), to EPC1 (on 10p11) in tumors which have a 6p;10p-translocation (EPC1-PHF1 fusion), and to MEAF6 (on 1p34) in ESS with t(1;6)(p34;p21) (Micci et al., 2006; Panagopoulos et al., 2012).  The introduction of next generation sequencing (also called high throughput sequencing, deep sequencing, etc.) techniques has opened up new possibilities in the field of DNA or RNA sequencing and whole transcriptome sequencing was shown to be a powerful tool to detect fusion genes in cancer (Maher et al., 2009). Recently, Lee et al. (2012) used a combination of banding cytogenetics and next-generation RNA sequencing to identify YWHAE-FAM22A/B chimeric genes in high-grade sarcomas not otherwise specified (NOS) of the uterus. In this study, we used a similar combination of methods to demonstrate that ZC3H7-BCOR is a recurrent chimera in a subset of ESS characterized cytogenetically by an X;22-translocation. MATERIALS AND METHODS  This study was approved by the Regional Committee for medical research ethics (REK S⊘r, http://helseforskning.etikkom.no), and written informed consent was obtained from the patients.  Patients  ESS Case 1  A 40-year-old woman presented with a history of dysmenorrhea at another hospital in November 2009. A polyp or leiomyoma of the uterus was suspected, possibly together with endometriosis. Examination of biopsies taken from the uterine serosa and cavity revealed an endometrial stromal sarcoma, however, and immunohistochemistry staining showed that the tumor was positive for CD10, ER, and PR, but negative for desmin, smooth muscle actin, h-caldesmon, and ALK-1. The diagnosis was confirmed upon re-evaluation of the specimen at the Norwegian Radium Hospital to which the patient was referred for further evaluation and treatment. Radiologic and clinical examination showed a tumor that infiltrated the entire thickness of the uterine wall and the pelvic peritoneum. The patient was treated by aromatase inhibitors for 4 months with good clinical response, and then radically operated in May 2010 with en-bloc hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and resection of the distal right ureter that had tumor masses in the pelvis. Macroscopic evaluation showed fibrosis and tumor nodules measuring 1.5–2 cm in the myometrium. Microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltration of the myometrium, parametrium, and right ureter by multiple tumor nodules consisting of bland spindle cells with little atypia and low (0–1/10 HPF) mitotic activity (Figures 1A and 1B). Many, but not all, tumor nodules contained endometrial glands confirming the ESS diagnosis. There was no necrosis or vessel infiltration. The patient has no evidence of disease recurrence to date.  Figure 1.  Figure 1. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide H&E stained sections. (A) and (B) are 100× magnification of ESS Case 1. (C) and (D) are 400× magnification of ESS Case 2. ESS Case 2  A 59-year-old woman presented at another hospital with pain over the symphysis pubis in April 2011. A leiomyoma of the uterus was suspected. A pipelle biopsy from the uterine cavity had been diagnosed as inactive endometrium and stromal fragments, possibly stromal nodule; no malignancy was suspected at the primary hospital, but the case was nevertheless referred for re-evaluation to the Department of Pathology at the Norwegian Radium Hospital where the diagnosis was changed to endometrial stromal sarcoma. The tumor tissue in the first biopsy as well as in a subsequent biopsy taken at the Norwegian Radium Hospital consisted of a typical population of spindle cells with relatively little atypia but with a prominent vascular proliferation, both characteristic of ESS (Figures 1C and 1D). The tumor had a high mitotic count. Immunohistochemistry performed on the biopsy taken at the Norwegian Radium Hospital showed the tumor to be positive for CD10 and vimentin but negative for ER, PR, desmin, actin, smooth muscle actin, and HMB-45. The patient underwent surgery in June 2011 with hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Macroscopic evaluation showed a tumor with largest diameter of 12 cm, which infiltrated the entire myometrium and uterine serosa. The left and right parametrium were not included in the specimen and therefore could not be assessed. Microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltration of the myometrium and uterine serosa, cervix, and mesoovarium by large, highly cellular tumor nodules consisting of spindle cells with a moderate degree of atypia and high (26/10 HPF) mitotic activity. Necrosis was seen. A metastasis to the intestine was found, whereas biopsies from various peritoneal locations and the omentum were negative. The metastasis had the same morphological appearance as the primary tumor. The patient has no evidence of disease recurrence to date. G-Banding Analysis  Samples from the surgically removed tumors were mechanically and enzymatically disaggregated and short-term cultured as described elsewhere (Mandahl, 2001). The cultures were harvested and the chromosomes were G-banded using Wright stain. The subsequent cytogenetic analysis and karyotype description followed the recommendations of the ISCN (Schaffer et al., 2009). High-Throughput Paired-End RNA-Sequencing  Tumor tissue adjacent to that used for cytogenetic analysis and histologic examination had been frozen and stored at -80°C. Total RNA was extracted from the two tumors using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Oslo, Norway) and quality checked by Experion (Biorad, Oslo, Norway). Three micrograms of total RNA from the ESS of Case 1 were sent for high-throughput pair-end RNA-sequencing to the Norwegian Sequencing Centre at Ullevål Hospital (http://www.sequencing.uio.no/). The Illumina software pipeline was used to process image data into raw sequencing data and only sequence reads marked as “passed filtering” were used in the downstream data analysis. A total of 98 million reads were obtained. The FASTQC software was used for the quality control of the raw sequence data (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The software FusionMap and the associated pre-built Human B37 and RefGene from the FusionMap website were used for the discovery of fusion transcripts (Ge et al., 2011), release date 2012-04-16 (http://www.omicsoft.com/fusionmap/).

The cDNA was diluted to 50 μL and 2 μL and used as templates in subsequent PCR assays. As control, an ESS with karyotype 46,XX,t(1;6)(p32∼ 34;p21) and known to carry the MEAF6-PHF1 chimera was used (Panagopoulos et al., 2012). The 25 μL PCR volume contained 12.5 μL of Premix Taq (Takara Bio Europe/SAS, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France), 1 μL of diluted cDNA, and 0.2 μM of each of the forward and reverse primers. For nested PCR, the first-round PCR products were diluted 1:1000 and 1 μL of the diluted products was used as template for the second PCR. The PCRs were run on a C-1000 Thermal cycler (Biorad). The PCR conditions were an initial denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, followed by 35 cycles of 7 sec at 98°C and 2 min at 68°C, and a final extension of 5 min at 68°C. For the detection of the ZC3H7B-BCOR fusion transcripts, the primer sets ZC3H7B-1190F/BCOR-3954R (1st PCR round) and ZC3H7B-1214F/BCOR-3860R (second PCR) were used. For the amplification of possible reciprocal BCOR-ZC3H7B fusion transcripts, the primer sets BCOR-3196F/ZC3H7B-1714R (1st PCR round) and BCOR-3256F/ZC3H7B-1649R (second PCR) were used. For amplification of the normal BCOR transcript, the primers ZC3H7B-1190F/ZC3H7B-1714R were used. For amplification of the normal ZC3H7B transcript, the primers BCOR-3196F/BCOR-3954R were used. Four microliter of the PCR products were stained with GelRed (Biotium, Hayward, CA), analyzed by electrophoresis through 1.0% agarose gel, and photographed. The ZC3H7B-BCOR amplified fragments were excised from the gel, purified using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen Nordic, Sollentuna, Sweden), and direct sequencing was performed using the light run sequencing service of GATC Biotech (http://www.gatc-biotech.com/en/sanger-services/lightrun-sequencing.html). The BCOR-ZC3H7B amplified products were cloned to pCR4-TOPO vector using TOPO TA Cloning Kits for Sequencing (Invitrogen), and colonies were picked and sequenced again using the light-run sequencing service of GATC Biotech. The BLAST software (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) was used for computer analysis of sequence data. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization  BAC clones were retrieved from the Human genome high-resolution BAC re-arrayed clone set (the “32k set”; BACPAC Resources, http://bacpac.chori.org/pHumanMinSet.htm). The “32k set” is mapped on the UCSC Genome browser on Human May 2004 (NCBI/hg17) assembly. Mapping data for the 32k human rearray are available in an interactive web format (http://bacpac.chori.org/pHumanMinSet.htm, from the genomic rearrays page) and are obtained by activation of the ucsc browser track for the hg17 UCSC assembly from the “32k set” homepage (http://bacpac.chori.org/genomicRearrays.php). The BAC clones were selected according to physical and genetic mapping data on chromosomes X and 22 (see below) as reported on the Human Genome Browser at the University of California, Santa Cruz website (May 2004, http://genome.ucsc.edu/). In addition, FISH mapping of the clones on normal controls was performed to confirm their chromosomal location. The clones used were RP11-645P13 (chrX:39514191-39729127) and RP11-330L22 (chrX:39632194-39848594) mapping to Xp11.4, which contain the BCOR gene (green), and RP11-257E19 (chr22:40003155-40184294) mapping to 22q13.2 for ZC3H7B (red). DNA was extracted and probes were labeled and hybridized according to Abbott Molecular recommendations (http://www.abbottmolecular.com/home.html). Chromosome preparations were counterstained with 0.2 μg/mL DAPI and overlaid with a 24 × 50 mm2 coverslip. Fluorescent signals were captured and analyzed using the CytoVision system (Applied Imaging, Newcastle, UK). RESULTS  G-Banding Findings  In Case 1, the G-banding analysis yielded a karyotype with simple chromosomal abnormalities 46,X,t(X;22)(p11;q13),t(3;4)(p23;q27)[8]/46,XX[8]. In Case 2, the karyotype was more complex: 42,X,dic(X;22)(p11;p11),der(1;9)(q25;p22∼ p24)ins(1;?)(q25;?), der(9)t(1;9)(q25;p22),-10,der(13;15)(q10;q10),-21,der(22)t(X;22)(p11;q13),+r[20]. Therefore, the two ESS had a derivative chromosome der(22)t(X;22)(p11;q13) (Figures 2A and 2B) in common.  Figure 2.  Figure 2.

(D) Metaphase spreads from ESS Case 2. A part of the BCOR-probe (green) had moved to the derivative chromosome 22 and a fusion signal was seen only on the derivative chromosome 22. The red signal for the ZC3H7B locus (22q13.2) was seen on chromosome 22 of the dic(X;22) chromosome. Molecular Genetic Findings  Using the FusionMap on the raw sequencing data obtained at the Norwegian Sequencing Centre, more than 1000 potential fusion genes were found in Case 1. The ZC3H7B-BCOR fusion transcript was ranked 9th with 39 seed counts. Taking into consideration that ZC3H7B and BCOR map to chromosome bands 22q13 and Xp11, respectively, and that both ESS carried a der(22)t(X;22)(p11;q13), we decided to investigate further the possibility of finding a recurrent ZC3H7B-BCOR fusion transcript. No other fusions were examined.  In both Cases 1 and 2 as well as in the control ESS with t(1;6) and a MEAF6-PHF1 chimera (see Materials and Methods section), normal cDNA fragments were amplified for both ZC3H7B and BCOR (Figure 3A). RT-PCR with the ZC3H7B-1190F/BCOR-3954R (1st PCR round) primer combination amplified a 610 bp cDNA fragment in Cases 1 and 2 but not in the ESS with MEAF6-PHF1 fusion (Figure 3B). Amplification with the ZC3H7B-1214F/BCOR-3860R (second PCR) primer combination generated a 495 bp cDNA fragment in Cases 1 and 2 (Figure 3C). Sequencing of the 495 bp cDNA fragments showed that in both cases, exon 10 of ZC3H7B (accession number NM_017590 version 4) was fused to exon 8 of BCOR (accession number NM_001123385 version 1) (Figure 3D).

Alignment of the sequence of the amplified fragments with the reference sequences NM_001123385 version 1 (of BCOR) and NM_017590 version 4 (ZC3H7B) showed the following amplified chimeric transcripts: (1) a transcript composed of exon 5 and exon 7 of BCOR followed by exon 11, exon 12, and exon 13 of ZC3H7B (exon 6 of BCOR was spliced out) (Figure 3E); (2) a transcript composed of exon 5 and exon 7 of BCOR followed by exon 13 of ZC3H7B (exon 6 of BCOR and exons 11 and 12 of ZC3H7B were spliced out) (Figure 3F); and (3) a transcript composed of BCOR exons 5–7 followed by exons 11–13 of ZC3H7B. FISH Findings  FISH using BAC RP11-257E19 (red signal) for the ZC3H7B locus (22q13.2) and a pool of the RP11-645P13 and RP11-330L22 (green signal) containing the BCOR gene (Xp11.4) showed that in metaphase spreads from ESS Case 1, part of the probe RP11-257E19 was moved to the derivative chromosome X and part of the pool of the RP11-645P13 and RP11-330L22 had moved to the derivative chromosome 22 (Figure 2C). Thus, fusion signals were seen on both derivative chromosomes X and 22. In ESS Case 2, a fusion signal was seen only on the derivative chromosome 22 (Figure 2D). The red signal for the ZC3H7B locus (22q13.2) was seen on the chromosome 22 of the dic(X;22) (Figure 2D).  The FISH results were in concordance with both G-banding and the molecular genetic findings. In ESS Case 1 carrying a balanced t(X;22)(p11;q13) and both ZC3H7B-BCOR and BCPR-ZC3H7B fusion transcripts, FISH fusion signals were seen on both derivative chromosomes X and 22. In ESS Case 2 carrying a dic(X;22)(p11;p11) and only the ZC3H7B-BCOR fusion transcripts, the fusion signal was seen only on the derivative chromosome 22. DISCUSSION  We found the ZC3H7B-BCOR fusion gene in both ESS carrying a der(22)t(X;22)(p11;q13) while the reciprocal BCOR-ZC3H7B was seen only in Case 1, suggesting that ZC3H7B-BCOR is the pathogenetically important chimera. At the genomic level, both ZC3H7B (in 22q13) and BCOR (in Xp11) are transcribed from centromere to telomere; thus, a simple balanced translocation is sufficient to generate a functional ZC3H7B-BCOR chimeric gene. At the cytogenetic level, likewise, both tumors had the der(22)t(X;22) whereas only Case 1 carried a der(X)t(X;22) (see karyotype above and Figures 2A and 2B). Case 2 had a more complex karyotype than Case 1 and a higher mitotic count. The level of genomic complexity therefore seemed to parallel phenotypic evidence of a higher degree of malignancy in this pair of tumors carrying a t(X;22) as the primary chromosomal abnormality.  The frequency of ZC3H7B-BCOR in ESS is not known, but we found the fusion in both tumors with a t(X;22) examined out of a total of 12 ESS investigated cytogenetically by us during the last decade. Lee et al. (2012) reported two cases of ESS with complex cytogenetic changes that included the aberrations del(X)(p11) and add(22)(q12) in the first tumor and a del(X)(p22) and add(22)(q13) in the second (Supporting Information Table S1, Cases 4 and 7 in Lee et al., 2012), i.e., aberrations similar to those seen in our two cases. We surmise that a ZC3H7B-BCOR chimera was also present in those two cases. Additionally, Amant et al. (2003) reported an ESS with 46,X,t(X;17)(p11;q23) as the sole anomaly; we think likely, BCOR rearrangement is also possible in that case.  ZC3H7B (also named RoXaN) was identified using a yeast two-hybrid assay as a cellular protein-binding partner for rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP3 (Vitour et al., 2004). The ZC3H7B protein has several domains that are involved in protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid interactions and, particularly, in multiprotein complexes. It contains (1) three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) near the amino terminus (37-149 aa). TPRs are short, highly degenerate motifs repeated at least three times and involved in protein–protein interactions (Blatch and Lassle, 1999). (2) Four Cys-X8-Cys-X5-Cys-X3-His (C3H1) and one C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, both of which are involved in RNA and DNA binding proteins (Krishna et al., 2003). (3) A cluster of amino acids (aa 257–271) which matches perfectly with the protein–protein interaction motif LDxLLxxL (called LD motif) were found in proteins of the paxillin superfamily (Tumbarello et al., 2002) and as a coil structure at the C-terminal region (904-941 aa) (Burkhard et al., 2001). ZC3H7B was found to be a nuclear protein whose LD domain functions as a nuclear export signal for the CRM1 nuclear export pathway; it plays a role in nuclear export of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABP-C1) (Harb et al., 2008).  The BCL6 co-repressor (BCOR) was identified in a two-hybrid screen for factors that interact with the POZ domain of BCL6, a transcriptional repressor important in immune responses and B-cell development (Huynh et al., 2000). BCOR is ubiquitously expressed and the encoded BCOR protein was, apart from being an interacting corepressor of BCL6, identified in complexes with polycomb group proteins RING1, RNF2, PCGF1, RYBP, KDM2B, and the ubiquitin E3 ligase SKP1 (Gearhart et al., 2006; Sanchez et al., 2007). Moreover, BCOR isoforms can interact with the mixed-lineage leukemia fusion partner AF9 (MLLT3) and modulate its transcriptional activity (Srinivasan et al., 2003). BCOR was found to be a key transcriptional regulator of early embryonic development, mesenchymal stem cell function, hemopoiesis, and vertebrate laterality (Hilton et al., 2007; Wamstad et al., 2008; Fan et al., 2009). In mesenchymal stem cells, BCOR interacts with KDM2B and represses gene transcription by inhibiting H3K4 and H3K36 methylation on the target gene promoter (Fan et al., 2009). In addition, the presence of RING1 and RNF2 in the BCOR complex suggests involvement in ubiquitylation of histones (Simon and Kingston, 2009). Germline mutations in BCOR are associated with the oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome, a rare X-linked dominant disease that is fatal in males, and Lenz microphthalmia, an X-linked recessive disease characterized by microphthalmia, mental retardation, and skeletal and other anomalies (Ng et al., 2004). Somatic mutations of BCOR were reported in acute myeloid leukemias with normal karyotypes (Grossmann et al., 2011) and a BCOR-RARA fusion was found in a case of acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML M3) carrying a t(X;17)(p11;q12) translocation (Yamamoto et al., 2011). Recently, a recurrent BCOR-CCNB3 fusion gene was reported in a “Ewing like” subtype of bone sarcoma (Pierron et al., 2012). In the two afore-mentioned chimeras, the BCOR gene was the 5′-end fusion partner; in BCOR-RARA, exon 13 of BCOR (reference NM_001123385) was fused in-frame to exon 3 of RARA (Yamamoto et al., 2011), whereas in BCOR-CCNB3, the entire coding region of BCOR was fused in-frame to exon 5 of CCNB3 (Pierron et al., 2012). The expression of these chimeras was driven by the BCOR promoter and the chimeric protein contained the BCOR-BCL6-binding domain (BCORBBD; 498-514 aa), AF9 binding site (1093-1233aa), the 3 ankyrin repeats (1410-1509 aa) of BCOR, and the NSPC1 binding site within residues 1428–1721 (Huynh et al., 2000; Srinivasan et al., 2003; Gearhart et al., 2006; Ghetu et al., 2008).  The putative ZC3H7B-BCOR protein corresponding to the fusion gene we detected would contain the TPRs and LD motif from ZC3H7B and the AF9 binding site (1093-1233aa), the 3 ankyrin repeats (1410-1509 aa), and the NSPC1 binding site of BCOR. Although these motifs suggest various functions for the chimeric protein, it is possible that its main effect would be via epigenetic mechanisms. Additional experiments are required to determine the oncogenetic mechanisms of ZC3H7B-BCOR.  ESS is a genetically heterogeneous group of tumors in which, at present, three recurrent groups of pathogenetic aberrations are known: the JAZF1-SUZ12 chimeric gene, PHF1 rearrangements (with formation of the JAZF1-PHF1, EPC1-PHF1, and MEAF6-PHF1 chimeras), and the ZC3H7B-BCOR chimeric gene we describe here. It seems that the oncogenesis brought about by all these aberrations has a common theme: alteration of the epigenetic machinery, particularly polycomb-mediated gene silencing (partly by direct repression of transcription and/or regulation of chromatin structure, partly through post-translation modification of histones). The JAZF1-SUZ12 chimeric gene and PHF1 rearrangements could affect the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) of which SUZ12 is a core component and with which PHF1 interacts. PRC2 is associated with transcription repression via methylation of Lys 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) (Margueron and Reinberg, 2011) and requires interaction with PHF1 in order to efficiently methylate H3K27 (Sarma et al., 2008). Recent studies of BCOR showed the presence of a BCOR complex which was distinct from, but related to, polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) (Simon and Kingston, 2009). In mesenchymal stem cells, BCOR interacts with KDM2B and represses gene transcription by inhibiting H3K4 and H3K36 methylation on the target gene promoter (Fan et al., 2009). Abnormal H3K4 and H3K36 methylation might be the result of a ZC3H7B-BCOR chimera. Whether or not JAZF1-SUZ12, PHF1 rearrangements, and ZC3H7B-BCOR lead to exactly the same tumor phenotype in ESS, or perhaps might be associated with prognostic differences, remains to be investigated.  
2277||The dysregulation of proper transcriptional control is a major cause of developmental diseases and cancers. Polycomb proteins form chromatin-modifying complexes that transcriptionally silence genome regions in higher eukaryotes. The BCL6 corepressor (BCOR) complex comprises ring finger protein 1B (RNF2/RING1B), polycomb group ring finger 1 (PCGF1), and lysine-specific demethylase 2B (KDM2B) and is uniquely recruited to nonmethylated CpG islands, where it removes histone H3K36me2 and induces repressive histone H2A monoubiquitylation. Germline BCOR mutations have been detected in patients with oculofaciocardiodental and Lenz microphthalmia syndromes, which are inherited conditions. Recently, several variants of BCOR and BCOR-like 1 (BCORL1) chimeric fusion transcripts were reported in human cancers, including acute promyelocytic leukemia, bone sarcoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, massively parallel sequencing has identified inactivating somatic BCOR and BCORL1 mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, medulloblastoma, and retinoblastoma. More importantly, patients with AML and MDS with BCOR mutations exhibit poor prognosis. This perspective highlights the detection of BCOR mutations and fusion transcripts of BCOR and BCORL1 and discusses their importance for diagnosing cancer subtypes and estimating the treatment responses of patients. Furthermore, this perspective proposes the need for additional functional studies to clarify the oncogenic mechanism by which BCOR and BCORL1 are disrupted in cancers, and how this may lead to the development of novel therapeutics. Mol Cancer Res; 12(4); 479–84. ©2014 AACR.  Introduction  A major cause of developmental diseases and cancers is the dysregulation of proper transcriptional control, a process that is directly regulated by transcription factors, coactivators, and corepressors. Till date, several hundred transcriptional coregulators have been reported in the literature. Recently, the increased use of massively parallel sequencing techniques has expanded our knowledge on the induction of congenital diseases and cancers caused by specific gene mutations.  The BCL6 Corepressor Complex as a Repressive, Transcriptional Machinery  The BCL6 corepressor (BCOR) was originally identified in 2000 as an interacting corepressor of BCL6 (1). This corepressor interacts with histone deacetylases and enhances BCL6-mediated transcriptional repression. Biochemical analyses identified BCOR as a complex comprising ring finger protein 2 (RFN2)/ring finger protein 1B (RING1B), polycomb group ring finger 1 (PCGF1)/nervous system polycomb 1 (NSPC1), lysine-specific demethylase 2B (KDM2B)/F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 10 (FBXL10), BCOR-like 1 (BCORL1), Ring 1 and YY1 binding protein (RYBP), YY1-associated factor 2 (YAF2), and S phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1; refs. 2–4). The BCOR complex components are similar to the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) components (Fig. 1; ref. 5).  Figure 1. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 1. The BCOR complex as a unique repressive, transcriptional machinery at CpG islands within transcription start sites (TSS). Nonmethylated CpG islands are used to recruit KDM2B through its CxxC domain, thus allowing H3K36me2 depletion via the KDM2b jmjC domain in these regions. RING1B monoubiquitylates histone H2A on K119, leading to the inhibition of specific transcription targets, including Hox, AP-2α, and Ink4b. LRR, leucine-rich region (7); RAWUL, RING finger- and WD40-associated ubiquitin-like domain (15); PUFD, PCGF Ub-like fold discriminator (15). The BCOR Complex Is a Distinct Subtype of PRC1  In higher eukaryotes, polycomb proteins form chromatin-modifying complexes that transcriptionally silence genome regions. Two main families of complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, are targeted to repressed, heterochromatic genome regions. Generally, PRC2 methylates histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27), whereas canonical PRC1 is recruited to the genome regions via H3K27me3. Subsequently, PRC1 monoubiquitylates histone H2A on lysine 119 (H2AK119) to induce transcriptional repression. A recent proteomics study led to the classification of six groups of PRC1 complexes (6). Each of these groups was further categorized as either canonical or noncanonical PRC1 complexes. PCGF2/MEL18 and PCGF4/BMI1 comprise the canonical PRC1 complexes, which depend on the presence of a CBX subunit. Only canonical PRC1 complexes are targeted to H3K27me3-enriched genome regions through the CBX subunit (6). On the other hand, the BCOR complex is categorized into a noncanonical PRC1 subgroup called PRC1.1 (6). The BCOR complex includes the core components of PRC1, RING1B, and PCGF1 as well as histone H3 on lysine 26 (H3K36me) demethylase KDM2B (Fig. 1; refs. 2–4, 6).  RING1B is an ubiquitin E3 ligase that catalyzes the monoubiquitylation of H2AK119, and the binding of PCGF1 and KDM2B stimulates E3 ligase activity (7, 8). KDM2B recruits the BCOR complex to nonmethylated CpG islands (CGI) through the ZF-CxxC DNA-binding domain of KDM2B (Fig. 1), not through H3K27me3-dependent targeting mechanisms (4, 7). In addition, ChIP-seq analysis of embryonic stem (ES) cells revealed that KDM2B was enriched near transcription start sites, including Hox gene loci (7). These data were consistent with the findings that DNA methylation strongly excludes the recruitment of BCOR complex components (9) and that PCGF1 regulates Hox expression (10, 11).  Another action of KDM2B is the specific demethylation of H3K36me2 via its jmjC domain (Fig. 1; refs. 8, 12). However, KDM2B was shown to function as an oncogene by negatively regulating the expression of p15ink4b tumor-suppressor gene via H3K36 demethylation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and Hoxa9/Meis1–induced leukemia cells (12, 13). In contrast, BCOR was shown to act as a growth suppressor in adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) isolated from a patient with oculofaciocardiodental (OFCD) syndrome because restoration of wild-type BCOR inhibited cell proliferation (14). Although a BCOR mutation significantly increased H3K36me2 methylation in the MSCs isolated from the patient with OFCD syndrome (MSC-O), gene expression profiling could not detect any differences between gene expression at the Ink4a-arf-ink4b locus in the MSC-O cells and that in wild-type MSCs (14).  PCGF1, another key component of the BCOR complex, is required for efficient H2AK119 monoubiquitylation (Fig. 1). Ross and colleagues observed a strong gain in self-renewal and a block in differentiation in lineage-marker negative (Lin−) cells that were simultaneously depleted of Pcgf1 and Runx1 (11). These data indicated that Pcgf1 primes hematopoietic progenitors for differentiation through H2AK119 monoubiquitylation on HoxA cluster genes, thus leading to the inhibition of HoxA transcription (11).  Taken together, these findings indicate that the BCOR complex, a distinct subtype of PRC1, epigenetically regulates specific gene transcription.  Germline BCOR Mutations in OFCD and Lenz Microphthalmia Syndromes  OFCD syndrome is an X-linked, recessively inherited disease, and affected patients have canine teeth with extremely long roots, congenital cataracts, craniofacial defects, and cardiac disease. BCOR germline mutations were first reported in OFCD syndrome patients in 2004. Ng and colleagues reported different frameshift, deletion, and nonsense mutations in BCOR (located on Xp11.4) in seven OFCD syndrome families (Fig. 2A, lower lane; refs. 16, 17). In addition, p.P85L missense mutation in BCOR was identified in 2 patients with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome (16, 17). These finding revealed BCOR as a key transcriptional regulator during early embryogenesis. This hypothesis has been underscored by findings in knockout mouse models of early embryonic development (18). In addition, BCOR regulates adult MSC functions through an epigenetic mechanism (14). The transcription factor AP-2α is developmentally important for the regulation of cell growth, programmed cell death, and differentiation. In the MSC-O cells, AP-2α was significantly overexpressed consequent to disengagement of BCOR complex repression on the AP-2α promoter (14). Moreover, BCOR mutations led to increased histone H3K36 methylation in the AP-2α promoter and decreased histone H2A ubiquitylation (14).  Figure 2.

Identification of BCOR-Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha Fusion in a Variant of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia  In 2010, our group reported the initial finding of a chimeric BCOR–RARA (retinoic acid receptor alpha) transcript in a t(X;17)(p11;q12) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) variant (Fig. 2C; ref. 19). Functional analysis confirmed that BCOR–RARA inhibited the transcriptional response to retinoic acid and exhibited aberrant subcellular localization (19). Typical APL is induced by t(15;17)(q22;q12) translocation, which results in promyelocytic leukemia (PML)–RARA fusion. PML–RARA exhibits double dominant-negative activities against the functions of both RARA and PML. Till date, fewer than 10 fusion partners of RARA have been identified in APL, including promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) and nucleophosmin (NPM). These fusion partners generally exert tumor-suppressive functions during leukemogenesis. The double dominant-negative activity of the PML–RARA fusion protein dysregulates the tumor-suppressive function of the partner protein; this seems to be one of the causes of leukemogenesis. In fact, NPM is among the most frequently mutated genes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Somatic BCOR Mutations in a Broad Range of Human Cancers  Since 2011, somatic BCOR mutations have been detected using whole-exome sequencing in 3.8% unselected patients with AML with normal karyotypes (CN-AML), 4.2% patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 7.4% patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; Table 1; refs. 20, 21). In contrast with the negative association between NPM1 and BCOR mutations in patients with AML, DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) mutations were detected in 43.5% and 44.4% patients with BCOR-mutated AML, respectively (20). Remarkably, BCOR mutations have been associated with poor prognosis in patients with CN-AML and MDS (20, 21). In male patients with AML, BCOR mutations disrupted the single gene allele, whereas in female patients with AML, the mutations selectively targeted the functional allele because the exclusive expression of mutated BCOR was detected by cDNA-based amplicon deep sequencing (20). Therefore, BCOR may also act as a single-hit tumor-suppressor gene in females. Targeted deep resequencing analyses of other myeloid-associated mutations revealed that in patients with MDS, somatic BCOR mutations arise after mutations in genes involved in splicing machinery or epigenetic regulation (21). These somatic mutations were scattered throughout the BCOR coding sequence and included nonsense, frameshift, insertion/deletion, and consensus splice-site mutations (Fig. 2A, upper lane). However, BCOR mutations tended to accumulate on the C-terminal side of the protein, which contains critical domains that recruit the main components PCGF1/NSPC1 and KDM2B (2, 15). Finally, frameshift or nonsense mutations in BCOR have been also reported in 9.5% patients with retinoblastoma (22) and 3.3% patients with medulloblastoma (ref. 23; Table 1).  View inlineView popup Table 1. Frequencies of BCOR and BCORL1 mutations in cancers Somatic BCORL1 Mutations in Myeloid Malignancies  BCORL1 is a BCOR homolog located on Xq25-q26.1; this protein acts a transcriptional repressor and contains tandem ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal binding protein (CtBP)–interacting motif (Fig. 2B; ref. 24). BCORL1 interacts with class II histone deacetylases and the CtBP corepressor through its PXDLS motif (24). Inactivating BCORL1 mutations have also been identified in 5.8% patients with AML, 9.1% patients with AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC), 0.8% patients with MDS, and 1.9% patients with CMML (Table 1; refs. 21, 25). The distribution and types of BCORL1 mutations were similar to those of BCOR mutations (Fig. 2B); however, the prognostic value of BCORL1 mutations remains unclear. Notably, BCORL1 depletion increased the replating capacity of Runx1-depleted Lin− cells (11). These results suggest that BCORL1 dysregulation may be a cause of myeloid malignancy.  BCOR–Cyclin B3 Fusion in a Subtype of Bone Sarcoma  BCOR and BCORL1 are ubiquitously expressed nuclear proteins. It is not surprising that genes belonging to the BCOR family are mutated in patients with nonhematologic malignancies. Till date, two types of intrachromosomal inversions involving the BCOR family have been reported. BCOR–CCNB3 (cyclin B3) fusion was identified by RNA-Seq in a subtype of bone sarcoma (26). BCOR–CCNB3 fuses exons 1 to 15 of BCOR to exons 5 to 12 of CCNB3 in an in-frame manner (Fig. 2C; ref 26). CCNB3, located on Xp11.22, encodes testis-specific cyclin B3, a member of the highly conserved cyclin family. High CCNB3 expression was observed in a BCOR-CCNB3–positive sarcoma (26); this expression can potentially dysregulate the cell cycle and induce sarcoma proliferation. Gene expression profiling experiments revealed that this BCOR-CCNB3–positive sarcoma was biologically distinct from other sarcomas (26).  BCORL1–E74-Like Factor 4 Fusion in Hepatocellular Carcinoma  In addition, BCORL1–ELF4 (E74-like factor 4) fusion was identified in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. This in-frame BCORL1–ELF4 fusion combined exons 1 to 11 of BCORL1 with exon 8 of ELF4 (Fig. 2C) and was generated by an intrachromosomal inversion (27). ELF4/myeloid elf-1 like factor (MEF) is a transcriptional activator that regulates hematopoietic and glioma stem cell functions as well as several lymphocytes and myelocytes (28, 29). As a consequence of the chimeric fusion protein, BCORL1–ELF4 exhibited decreased repression activity compared with BCORL1 (27).  BCOR and BCORL1 Are Putative Tumor-Suppressor Genes  We overviewed the genetic mutations that have been found in the BCOR family in a broad range of human cancers. These findings were previously undetectable because intrachromosomal rearrangements were difficult to reveal using conventional chromosomal analyses such as G-banding or standard Sanger sequencing. The increased use of massively parallel sequencing technology to screen large tumor sample series has led to the further identification of novel BCOR family gene mutations. These findings will be valuable for the diagnosis and genetics-based classification of unrecognized tumor subtypes, thus providing more beneficial information for estimating patient prognoses and treatment responses. The types of BCOR family mutations observed in cancers are generally disruptive to BCOR or BCORL1. These findings support the hypothesis that BCOR and BCORL1 are putative tumor-suppressor genes. However, further experiments are needed to prove this hypothesis.  Conclusions  The BCOR complex is a noncanonical subtype of the PRC1. However, KDM2B recruits the BCOR complex to nonmethylated CGI, rather than acting through H3K27me3-dependent targeting mechanisms. Furthermore, the BCOR complex acts as a transcriptional repressor to monoubiquitylate H2AK119 in specific promoter regions. Currently available data show that, in contrast with canonical PRC1, the BCOR complex is necessary for proper cell differentiation and proliferation. In addition to germline BCOR mutations in the OFCD syndrome, the discovery of somatic mutations and several chimeric fusion transcripts of BCOR and BCORL1 in a broad range of human cancers imply that BCOR and BCORL1 are putative tumor-suppressor genes. More importantly, BCOR mutations have been associated with poor prognosis in patients with CN-AML and MDS. Therefore, therapeutic interventions in BCOR complex signaling, including H2AK119 ubiquitylation and H3K36 demethylation, may improve the prognosis of patients with BCOR complex–dysregulated cancers.  
2278||he identification of subtype-specific translocations has revolutionized the diagnostics of sarcoma and has provided new insight into oncogenesis. We used RNA-seq to investigate samples from individuals diagnosed with small round cell tumors of bone, possibly Ewing sarcoma, but which lacked the canonical EWSR1-ETS translocation. A new fusion was observed between BCOR (encoding the BCL6 co-repressor) and CCNB3 (encoding the testis-specific cyclin B3) on the X chromosome. RNA-seq results were confirmed by RT-PCR and through cloning of the tumor-specific genomic translocation breakpoints. In total, 24 BCOR-CCNB3–positive tumors were identified among a series of 594 sarcoma cases. Gene profiling experiments indicated that BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases are biologically distinct from other sarcomas, particularly Ewing sarcoma. Finally, we show that CCNB3 immunohistochemistry is a powerful diagnostic marker for this subgroup of sarcoma and that overexpression of BCOR-CCNB3 or of truncated CCNB3 activates S phase in NIH3T3 cells. Thus, the intrachromosomal X-chromosome fusion described here represents a new subtype of bone sarcoma caused by a newly identified gene fusion mechanism.

Figure 5 right Main Main• Methods• Accession codes• References• Acknowledgments• Author information• Supplementary information Sarcomas, tumors derived from mesenchymal tissues, account for ~2% of human cancers and constitute a very heterogeneous group of tumors that can be divided into more than 100 different subtypes on the basis of clinical, pathological, immunohistological and genetic features. In adolescents and young adults, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma are the two predominant bone sarcomas. Ewing sarcoma is genetically characterized by gene fusions between genes in the EWSR1 and ETS families1, 2, 3. In addition, EWSR1-NFATC2 fusions were recently observed in a minority of tumors from affected individuals4. In osteosarcoma, various point mutations and copy-number variations have been described, but, to date, no recurrent gene fusion has been reported5.  To identify novel fusion transcripts in small round cell sarcomas, we selected four cases that clinically and morphologically would be classified in the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors but that lacked the pathognomonic gene fusions that characterize Ewing sarcoma. Cases were analyzed using RNA-seq6, 7 with paired-end sequencing on a SOLiD platform. For each sample, a mean of 1.23 × 108 paired-end reads were mapped to the reference genome (hg19). Three analysis programs that differed in their principles, Genomatix, FusionSeq8, 9 and in-house software, were used to search for novel gene fusions. Strong fusion transcript predictions were found in two cases. In one case, a putative FUS-FEV fusion was observed and subsequently confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown). Although not included in the gene fusion screening panel10, this fusion was previously described in one case of Ewing sarcoma11. In the second case (case 330T), a total of 20 distinct and high-quality paired-end fragments were observed to link exon 15 of BCOR12 and exon 5 of CCNB3 (ref. 13), which are located at Xp11.4 and Xp11.22, respectively (Fig. 1a,b). Analysis of exon coverage showed that all BCOR exons were well represented (median base coverage of ~2,000) with a notable decrease in the coverage at the 3′ end of the BCOR coding sequence (median base coverage of ~300) (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). The decreased coverage at this position was specific for this tumor, as it was not observed in the alignments of the three other cases (Supplementary Fig. 1). For CCNB3, virtually no read was observed in the first four exons, whereas the coverage of exons 5–12 was comparable to that observed throughout BCOR (Fig. 1c).  Figure 1: RNA-seq identification of the BCOR-CCNB3 fusion. RNA-seq identification of the BCOR-CCNB3 fusion. (a) Scheme of paired-end coverage of the junction between BCOR and CCNB3 sequences using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) tools. The transcription orientation is reported in the 5′ to 3′ direction from BCOR exon 15 to CCNB3 exon 5. The junction between the transcripts is represented by the vertical dashed line. Each paired-end read is represented by a horizontal segment consisting of an orange box on the left (the 50-bp F3 mate) and a gray box on the right (the F5 25-bp mate) connected by a line representing the unsequenced part of the paired-end fragment. Duplicated reads have been removed according to the criterion that only reads having F3 mates starting at distinct positions are conserved. F3 reads were aligned 5′ to 3′ along the BCOR sequence. (b) A schematic of the X chromosome with position and strand orientation indicated for the BCOR and CCNB3 genes (arrows). (c) Read coverage of the BCOR and CCNB3 exons (BioScope alignment). The base coverage corresponding to each intron or exon is indicated relative to the schematics showing genomic organization. The median base coverage of BCOR, including exon duplicates, was ~2,000 (maximum 3,939 in exon 4), comparable to CCNB3 coverage (median ~2,500, maximum 5,394 on exon 5). (d) RT-PCR detection of a specific 290-bp fragment in tumor RNA (330T) but not in blood RNA (330C) from the same individual. Control, PCR-negative control; L, 100-bp ladder. (e) Structure of the BCOR-CCNB3 cDNA. Purple boxes, the three ankyrin domains of BCOR; green boxes, the two cyclin domains of CCNB3. The sequence of the BCOR-CCNB3 junction is shown, with the encoded protein sequence reported below it (red dashed arrow indicates the fusion point). The complete BCOR-CCNB3 nucleotide and protein sequences are shown in Supplementary Figure 6.  Full size image (109 KB) Figures/tables index Next To confirm these findings, specific primers designed for BCOR exon 15 (BCOR.1) and CCNB3 exon 5 (CCNB3.1) were used in RT-PCR experiments. The expected fragment was amplified from the tumor RNA, whereas no specific amplification was observed using RNA from the peripheral blood cells of the same individual (Fig. 1d). Sequencing of the amplified fragment identified an in-frame fusion between the last codon of BCOR and exon 5 of CCNB3 (Fig. 1e).  To further characterize the breakpoint at the genomic level, FISH experiments and long-range PCR were conducted. Two BACs flanking BCOR were labeled with FITC and two BACs flanking CCNB3 were labeled with rhodamine, and probes were hybridized to nuclei from normal cells or from case 330T. The green or red doublets observed in normal cells were clearly disrupted in nuclei from 330T, where there was juxtaposition of green and red spots (usually appearing as yellow spots), thereby showing the presence of the X-chromosome inversion (Fig. 2a). Moreover, long-range PCR using the BCOR.1 and CCNB3.1 primers detected a specific PCR product that was observed in the tumor sample but not in DNA from matched blood cells, indicating that the rearrangement was somatically acquired (Fig. 2b). Sequencing of this fragment revealed that the fusion lies on the X chromosome between positions 39,910,434 and 50,050,261, which correspond to the BCOR-MID1IP1 intergenic region and intron 4 of CCNB3, respectively (Fig. 2c). Of note, the stop codon of BCOR (TGA) is included within a putative GGTGAG donor splice-site sequence. Thus, the most likely hypothesis accounting for the fusion mRNA is that this cryptic donor site is spliced with the acceptor site of exon 5 of CCNB3, and this was confirmed by analyzing the sequence of the cDNA junction (Fig. 1e). Splicing was found to be incomplete, leading to both BCOR-CCNB3 and wild-type BCOR expression (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2).  Figure 2: Characterization of the BCOR-CCNB3 genomic rearrangement and demonstration of its recurrence in small round cell sarcomas.

(a) A paracentric inversion on the X chromosome was seen in FISH experiments. Top, BACs RP11-91I16 and RP11-66502 were labeled with FITC, and BACs CTD-2107N14 and RP11-576P23 were labeled with rhodamine. Arrows indicate the position and orientation of the BCOR and CCNB3 genes.

Full size image (60 KB) Previous Figures/tables index Next To assess the prevalence of the fusion transcript across a large collection of sarcomas, we used fusion-specific RT-PCR to screen a series of 594 sarcomas that lacked EWSR1-ETS, EWSR1-NFATC2, EWSR1-WT1, SYT-SSX, PAX3-FOXO1 and PAX7-FOXO1, the most frequent sarcoma fusions that are routinely investigated in the diagnostic laboratory. A total of 24 cases with BCOR-CCNB3 were identified (Table 1). When tumor DNA was available, long-range PCR confirmed the presence of genomic fusions of variable sizes (Fig. 2b,d). Of note, all tumors but five were localized to bone, and all occurred in adolescents or young adults. In most cases, the pathological report was consistent with an undifferentiated, small round cell sarcoma, suggestive of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors. However, in contrast to Ewing sarcoma, approximately half of our cases lacked strong membrane positivity for CD99 (Table 1).  Table 1: Clinical and pathological data for individuals harboring BCOR-CCNB3 Ewing-like tumors Full table Figures/tables index To further investigate the relationship of the BCOR-CCNB3–positive tumor group with other sarcomas, we performed gene profiling by microarray in ten cases for which good-quality RNA was available. The resulting profiles were compared with data from osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, malignant rhabdoid tumors and desmoplastic round cell tumors. In a variety of unsupervised multivariate statistical factorization techniques, including correspondence analysis (COA) and principal-component analysis (PCA), the group with the BCOR-CCNB3 fusion formed a distinct cluster from all other groups (Fig. 3a). Given the clinical and morphological similarities of this group with the Ewing sarcoma group, we specifically compared the expression profile of the BCOR-CCNB3–positive tumors with that of EWSR1-ETS–positive Ewing sarcomas, and our findings confirmed the marked difference between the two groups, with more than 3,000 probe sets showing highly significant differences in expression levels (Fig. 3b). The comparison of the BCOR-CCNB3–positive group with Ewing sarcoma was used for a gene set enrichment analysis. Two of the most significantly different gene sets corresponded to Ewing sarcoma–specific gene sets, including the Zhang_Targets_of_EWSR1_FLI1_fusion and the Riggi_Ewing_sarcoma_progenitor signatures (Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). In particular, most of the well-known EWSR1-FLI1 target genes3, such as NR0B1, CAV1, CAV2, PRKCB, NKX2-2, IGFBP3, IGFBP5, IGFBP7, CCK and MYC, which have been shown to have critical roles in Ewing sarcoma oncogenesis, were not expressed in the BCOR-CCNB3–positive tumors.  Figure 3: BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases are distinct from other small round cell tumors and particularly from Ewing sarcoma. BCOR-CCNB3-positive cases are distinct from other small round cell tumors and particularly from Ewing sarcoma. (a) An unsupervised COA multivariate analysis comparing BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases with desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), Ewing sarcoma (ES) and malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) cases. Other tumor types are not shown for clarity. Ewing sarcomas profiled in the same experiment as BCOR-CCNB3–positive tumors are indicated in green, and Ewing sarcomas profiled on the same platform but in previous experiments are indicated in blue. The distinct clustering of BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases and Ewing sarcomas is not caused by a platform bias. Comp., component. (b) A volcano plot comparing BCOR-CCNB3 positive cases with EWSR1-ETS–positive Ewing sarcoma cases. Expression levels were compared using the Welch t test. Probe sets with Bonferroni-adjusted Welch two-sample t-test P values of <0.01 and log ratio of mean values between the BCOR-CCNB3 and Ewing sarcoma groups of >3 are shown in red (3,203 probe sets). (c) GSEA on genes ranked differentially between BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases and EWSR1-ETS–positive Ewing sarcomas. Bars indicate each gene of the Zhang_targets_of_EWSR1_FLI1_fusion signature.

(d) Heat map of expression of EWSR1-FLI1 signature genes in BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases. Genes were ranked using a signal-to-noise metric. Complete annotation is provided in Supplementary Figure 3. Similar results were obtained with the RIGGI_Ewing_sarcoma_progenitor_up signature gene set (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4).  Full size image (129 KB) Previous Figures/tables index Next Finally, SNP6.0 arrays detected no alteration in 11 of the 18 cases studied. In the other seven cases, the only recurrent abnormalities were deletions at chromosomes 17p and 10q, each observed in two cases. Neither deletion nor amplification of the fusion partners was observed. Of note, the most frequent copy-number abnormalities of Ewing sarcoma14, particularly the gain at chromosome 8 that is observed in ~50% of Ewing sarcoma cases, and the gain of 1q or chromosome 12 or the loss of 16q, which are each observed in ~25% of Ewing sarcoma cases, were not recurrent characteristics of BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases. These data indicate that classic Ewing sarcomas and BCOR-CCNB3–positive tumors do not share common copy-number changes. Altogether, these data identify a new group of bone sarcomas that is characterized by a recurrent BCOR-CCNB3 fusion resulting from an X-chromosome paracentric inversion. Despite remarkable clinical and pathological similarities with the Ewing sarcoma group, gene profiling and SNP array analyses indicated that this new group of tumors is biologically distinct from Ewing sarcoma and, in particular, does not share the EWSR1-ETS expression signature. We propose that this new group be called 'Ewing-like' tumors. To further investigate key oncogenic pathways that may characterize the BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases, a comparative analysis was conducted between the BCOR-CCNB3–positive group and other tumor types (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables 1–3; to avoid over-representation of any tumor type in the analysis, the comparison was made using 10 cases randomly selected from each of the 11 tumor types). Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) as well as Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) pathway analyses indicated that morphogenesis and development, especially of the skeletal system, were strongly represented because of the overexpression of numerous homeobox genes. Furthermore, activation of the Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways was also highly significant in this analysis (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Tables 4–6).  Figure 4: Functional consequences of BCOR-CCNB3 expression. Functional consequences of BCOR-CCNB3 expression. (a) GSEA on genes ranked differentially between BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases and other sarcomas or pediatric tumors (10 tumors randomly chosen in 11 tumor groups) identified signatures of Hedgehog and Wnt pathways activation (Supplementary Table 6). NES, normalized enrichment score; NOM, nominal; FDR, false discovery rate. (b) An increased proportion of cells in S phase is associated with BCOR-CCNB3 expression. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with vectors encoding BCOR-CCNB3 or truncated CCNB3 (ΔCCNB3), and the cell cycle was analyzed after BrdU staining (the means and standard deviations from three independent experiments are shown; Welch two-sample t-test P values = 3.3 × 10−3 and 2.4 × 10−3 for the two constructs compared to empty vector, respectively).  Full size image (60 KB) Previous Figures/tables index Next It is notable that the newly characterized rearrangement includes two important genes on the X chromosome. Indeed, BCOR encodes a ubiquitously expressed transcriptional repressor that associates with the BCL6 oncoprotein and with a variety of histone modifying enzymes, suggesting that it acts as a suppressor of gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms12, 15. The observation that BCOR regulates mesenchymal stem cell function by epigenetic mechanisms is of particular interest because of the connection it suggests between BCOR and bone tumors16. Alterations in BCOR have been associated with human disease. Indeed, mutations of BCOR are responsible for the inherited oculofaciocardiodental and Lenz microphtalmia syndromes17. Moreover, BCOR has recently been described as a fusion partner of RARA in acute promyelocytic leukemia and has been proposed to be a tumor suppressor gene in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia18, 19.  CCNB3 expression is tightly restricted to the testis, with CCNB3 encoding an early meiotic cyclin that is expressed in the leptotene and zygotene phases of spermatogenesis13, 20. This expression pattern strongly suggests that ectopic expression of CCNB3 as a result of the BCOR gene fusion may constitute a key oncogenic event in this newly characterized type of Ewing-like tumors. This hypothesis was investigated by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining of mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing BCOR-CCNB3 or ΔCCNB3, a truncated version of CCNB3 corresponding to the portion involved in the fusion gene. Compared to the empty vector, both expression vectors led to a twofold increase in the proportion of cells in S phase (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 5). Read counts (Fig. 1c) and microarray experiments showed similar intensities for the expression of the 5′ region of BCOR and the 3′ region of CCNB3 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 2), strongly suggesting that the BCOR-CCNB3 fusion is expressed as a full transcript and that the truncated CCNB3 is not expressed by itself. Although cell cycle analyses clearly show that the CCNB3 portion of the fusion is potentially sufficient to mediate cell cycle effects, it is expected that oncogenesis also relies on additional phenotypic effects from the full-length fusion protein.  Finally, in the series of close to 1,000 tumor samples profiled in our laboratory, including a spectrum of pediatric tumors, adult sarcomas and brain tumors, only the BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases had very high expression levels of CCNB3, indicating the outstanding specificity of this marker (Fig. 5a). This specificity was further tested using a CCNB3-specific antibody. A total of 43 tumor samples were investigated, including BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases, Ewing sarcomas, small round cell desmoplastic tumors, rhabdomyosarcomas and synovial sarcomas. In contrast to the 25 BCOR-CCNB3–negative cases that completely lacked staining, the 18 BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases that were tested exhibited strong nuclear CCNB3 staining (Fig. 5b). This finding highlights the potential usefulness of a simple CCNB3 immunohistochemical assay as a diagnostic test for this subgroup of sarcoma.  Figure 5: Expression of CCNB3 across a series of tumors. Expression of CCNB3 across a series of tumors. (a) Box plots of the intensity of the 231481_at probe set (log scale) in BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases (10 cases), desmoplastic small round cell tumors (DSRCT, EWSR1-WT1 positive; 32 cases), Ewing sarcomas (EWSR1-ETS positive; 74 cases), gliomas (17 cases), medulloblastomas (Mb, 52 cases), SMARCB1-deficient malignant rhabdoid (MRT; 35 cases), neuroblastomas (Nb; 64 cases), osteosarcomas (35 cases), retinoblastomas (Rb; 39 cases), rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS; 121 cases), synovial sarcomas (Synov.; 34 cases) and other sarcomas (288 cases). Normal samples included 353 normal tissues (GSE3526) of which the three upper outliers are testis samples. The sarcomas that expressed intermediate levels of CCNB3 tested negative for the BCOR-CCNB3 fusion. The expression level of BCOR is reported in Supplementary Figure 2.

Full size image (133 KB) Previous Figures/tables index In conclusion, our study highlights the power of next-generation sequencing, particularly RNA-seq, and microarray experiments in refining the subclassification of the highly heterogeneous group of sarcomas. Our results identify a distinct gene fusion, thereby shedding new light on the development of two tumor classes with similar phenotypes, Ewing sarcomas and Ewing-like tumors. On the basis of our observations, we can infer distinct mechanisms of oncogenesis for these subtypes, which may be of critical significance for diagnostics and, possibly, for therapeutic intervention in the coming age of personalized medicine. A potential relationship between this group of tumors and CIC-DUX4–positive cases will also be important to consider21. Further studies will be required to model the BCOR-CCNB3 fusion in cell and animal models in order to decipher the downstream consequences of this fusion, evaluate the respective contributions of the BCOR and CCNB3 portions of the fusion and gain insights into the underlying oncogenic processes.

Methods Main• Methods• Accession codes• References• Acknowledgments• Author information• Supplementary information RNA extraction. Tumors were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. After crushing tumors, we isolated total RNA using the TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen) that employs a method based on GITC-phenol-chloroform extraction. RNA was quantified with Qubit (Invitrogen) and Nanodrop ND1000 (ThermoFisher Scientific) before quality assessment with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.  RNA library construction. PolyA mRNA was purified from 10 μg of total RNA using NucleoTrap mRNA (Macherey Nagel) according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Following the SOLiD Total RNA Seq kit instructions, we fragmented 100 ng of polyA RNA by incubation with RNAse III for 10 min in a 10-μl reaction volume containing 1× RNAse III buffer with the enzyme. Fragmented RNA was then purified using the RiboMinus Concentration Module (Invitrogen). The yield and size distribution of the fragmented RNA were assessed using the Quant-iT RNA assay kit with the Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen) and the RNA 6000 Pico Chip kit with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. A total of 50 ng of fragmented RNA was hybridized and ligated with the SOLiD adaptor mix and reverse transcribed according to the manufacturer's instructions.  The isolated cDNA was size selected to be ~200 bp using Novex pre-cast gel products. cDNA was then amplified according to the SOLiD Total RNA Seq kit protocol. The yield and size distribution of the cDNA were assessed using the Quant-iT HS DNA assay kit with the Qubit fluorometer and the High Sensitivity DNA Assay Chip kit on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.  Emulsion PCR. Templated beads were generated for sequencing using standard protocols from the manufacturer. Briefly, an aqueous phase was prepared from the SOLiD ePCR kit containing AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase UP, ePCR buffer, MgCl2, dNTPs, amplification primers and library template. The aqueous phase was then introduced to an oil phase in an ULTRA-TURRAX Turbo Drive (IKA) to create a water-in-oil emulsion. The emulsion was then transferred to a 96-well plate, and PCR amplification was carried out using the recommended PCR conditions. After PCR amplification, emulsions were broken using butanol, and the beads were washed, enriched and treated with terminal transferase before quantification and deposition on a slide for sequencing.  Whole transcriptome paired-end sequencing. Templated beads from each sample were deposited on two quadrants of a slide. Massively parallel ligation sequencing was carried out using the Applied Biosystems SOLiD System (V4 chemistry) following the manufacturer's instructions.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS). Apart from Genomatix analysis, NGS raw data were aligned in color space using the color-coded error correction capability of Life Technology's BioScope environment and a set of human genome reference sequences associated with the hg19 version of the human genome. The distribution of insert size, excluding adaptors, was 116 bp (90% confidence interval = 60–163 bp). NGS analysis was performed using three independent paired-end gene fusion analysis pipelines: Genomatix NGS by Genomatix Software, FusionSeq by the Gerstein laboraotry1 and an in-house pipeline. All three methods, although quite different in conception, successfully detected the presence of a newly identified BCOR-CCNB3 chimeric fusion in one sample (330T) and the known FUS-FEV fusion in another sample.  Genomatix NGS pipeline. Alignment and analysis of the NGS data sets were performed directly by Genomatix bioinformaticians. Raw data were aligned against the human genome (NCBI Build 37) and transcriptome (ElDorado 12-2010; containing transcript annotation from RefSeq, GeneBank, Ensembl and crossmappings) using the two-step mapping strategy from the Genomatix Mining Station. Data were mapped with low stringency, allowing one point mutation in the seed search (deep) and 85% overall alignment quality in the subsequent step. In addition, global and local spliced alignment was performed to find split reads spanning exon boundaries and fusion events. Paired-end read statistics (mean insert size, s.d., strand orientation and pileup distribution) were calculated automatically and subsequently used for gene fusion detection.  Gene fusions within and across chromosomes were derived from uniquely mapped paired-end reads in four steps, including filtering, clustering, inclusion of splice-junction information and scoring. The filtering removed read pairs if one or both reads did not uniquely map to the genome, if the reads aligned within the expected distance or if any pair was contained in an artificial pileup. All paired-end reads that passed the filters and were mapped to transcripts from different loci were considered as gene fusion candidates. After clustering reads mapping to proximal positions, global spliced alignments were included as an additional line of evidence to determine the exact breakpoint. In the last step, the gene fusion candidates were ranked by the number of spliced reads and the number of paired-end fragments that support any gene fusion candidate (Supplementary Table 7).  FusionSeq pipeline. NGS raw data were aligned in color space using the color-coded error correction capability of the BioScope environment. Overall, the alignment was ungapped allowing two color-code mismatches against the reference sequence for each paired-end read. Local clipping of <5 bases at the start or the end of the paired-end reads were allowed to maximize the number of aligned reads. The F3 and F5 paired-end mates were aligned independently against three hg19 reference libraries: a library of non-coding sequences (784 non-coding sequences delivered with the BioScope software (including SOLiD 4 adaptor sequences, rRNA, tRNA and single base–repeat sequences among others) to be discarded during alignment, the human genome reference library and a canonical splice-junction library built from RefSeq annotations (.gtf file available via UCSC) that reconstitute the junction sequence between two consecutive exons.  The results of F3 and F5 read alignments were then merged, and pairing was performed. No quality control filter was applied in advance, and the resulting BAM file held the complete set of aligned paired-end reads.  The BAM file was then passed to FusionSeq for processing according to our instructions9. The fusion transcript detection module employs the UCSC Known Genes set that contains 66,803 isoforms. First, poor quality and orphan reads were removed. Then, paired-end reads that mapped to the same gene were considered as part of the normal transcriptome. Paired-end reads that mapped to different genes were selected as potential candidate fusion transcripts. The complete list of fusion proposals was then passed through a 'filtration cascade' to remove spurious candidate fusion genes. We applied in order the MitochondrialFilter and RepeatMaskerFilter procedures. The AnnotationConsistencyFilters was also applied to remove fusion gene candidates for which one of the partners was annotated as collagen, clone, ribosomalorpseudogene, which were supposed to have elevated sequence homology with genes of the same class. The reduced list of fusion candidates was then classified by FusionSeq according to the type of genomic region involved (exons, introns, splice junctions or UTR regions), the absolute number of exon-to-exon paired-end reads encompassing the junction and the following three statistical indicators: normalized number of supportive paired-end reads (SPER), difference between the analytically calculated and expected SPER (DASPER) and the ratio of empirically computed SPERs (RESPER). We extracted from this conspicuous data set the information concerning the exon-to-exon junctions. We used the absolute number of paired-end fragments encompassing the fusion junction and the DASPER indicator to rank the fusion candidates. This procedure returned a list of 16 fusion candidates that are reported in Supplementary Table 8. Probable false positive candidates were further filtered out on the basis of (i) mapping quality (MAPQ ≥ 20), (ii) non redundancy (only one paired-end read was retained for groups of reads with F3 and F5 mates starting at identical positions), (iii) length of F3 and F5 reads (only mates of 50 and 25 bp were retained), (iv) consistency of insert size assuming an intronic breakpoint (insert size in the range of 60–163 bp was considered normal) and (v) unambiguous mapping (paired-end reads having homologous sequences in the exome and genome were discarded) (Supplementary Table 8).  In-house pipeline. A set of in-house scripts was written in bash, awk and R languages for the Linux system. Raw data were aligned in color space using BioScope ungapped alignment modules, but a coding sequence (CDS) library was used instead for each gene. CDS annotations were extracted from the UCSC RefSeq GTF annotation file and a fasta seq reference library was built by concatenating the sequence of each exon in the same order as in the genome. F3 and F5 paired-end reads were aligned independently by allowing two color-code mismatches for each read. Finally, the Read-Pairing module of BioScope was used to create a paired-end read BAM file. A first read quality filter was applied to remove paired-end reads whose MAPQ score from the SAMtools quality indicator was <20. We then separated paired-end reads contained within a single gene from those encompassing different genes by simply checking the gene partners, orientation and expected insert size associated in each paired-end fragment. We selected the top ten fusion gene candidates with the highest number of paired-end reads spanning the junction (Supplementary Table 9). False positive candidates were further filtered out using the five criteria used in the FusionSeq pipeline.  RT-PCR and long-range genomic PCR. BCOR3.1 and CCNB3.1 primers (sequences in Supplementary Table 10) were used to amplify cDNA and genomic sequences.  Microarray data. Experimental procedures for GeneChip microarrays were performed according to the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual using HG-U133-Plus2 arrays. All microarray data were simultaneously normalized using the gcrma package version 2.22.0 in the R 2.12.0 environment22, and quality assessment was based on relative log expression and normalized unscaled standard errors. COA analysis was performed using made4 (ref. 23) and rgl (developed by D. Adler and D. Murdoch) R packages. Gene set enrichment analysis24 was done by comparing Ewing-like and Ewing sarcoma cases using a signal-to-noise ratio algorithm. The Ewing-like and Ewing sarcoma comparison was performed using the Welsh t test, and associated P values were corrected for multiple testing with the Bonferroni method. SAM analyses were performed with the samr R package22, 25 using the 10 BCOR-CCNB3–positive samples with a random selection of 10 samples in each of 11 other tumor types. Ten different analyses were performed with different samplings. Cutoffs for significance (Delta parameters) were defined as first value with a 90th percentile false discovery rate (FDR) below 0.01. DAVID analyses26 were performed online using parameters of EASE value of <1 × 10−5, count of >10, fold enrichment of >2 and Bonferroni P value of <1 × 10−2.  FISH experiments. FISH analysis was performed on 4-μm thick frozen tissue sections fixed for 10 min in a 1:3 acetic acid:ethanol bath. Slides were immersed in 2× saline–sodium citrate (SSC) buffer, pH 7.0, for 30 min at 37 °C. The sections were then progressively dehydrated in alcohol (70%, 90% and 100%) for 2-min intervals and air dried. The BCOR probe was composed of a set of two flanking BAC clones (CHORI): RP11-91I16 (telomeric) and RP11-665O2 (centromeric), both biotin labeled (Biotin Nick Translation Mix, Roche) and were detected with Avidin-Fluorescein (Roche, 1975595910). The CCNB3 flanking probes were CTD- 2107N14 (telomeric) and RP11-576P23 (centromeric), both digoxigenin labeled (DIG Nick Translation Mix, Roche) and detected with Anti-Digoxygenin–Rhodamine Fab Fragment (Roche, 11207750910).

2385|| Abstract Shp2, an ubiquitously expressed protein tyrosine phosphatase, is essential for regulation of Ras/ERK signaling pathway and tumorigenesis. Here we report that Shp2 is modified by SUMO1 at lysine residue 590 (K590) in its C-terminus, which is reduced by SUMO1-specific protease SENP1. Analysis of wild-type Shp2 and SUMOylation-defective Shp2K590R mutant reveals that SUMOylation of Shp2 promotes EGF-stimulated ERK signaling pathway and increases anchorage-independent cell growth and xenografted tumor growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Furthermore, we find that mutant Shp2K590R reduces its binding with the scaffolding protein Gab1, and consistent with this, knockdown of SENP1 increased the interaction between Shp2 and Gab1. More surprisingly, we show that human Shp2 (hShp2) and mouse Shp2 (mShp2) have differential effects on ERK activation as a result of different SUMOylation level, which is due to the event of K590 at hShp2 substituted by R594 at mShp2. In summary, our data demonstrate that SUMOylation of Shp2 promotes ERK activation via facilitating the formation of Shp2-Gab1 complex and thereby accelerates HCC cell and tumor growth, which presents a novel regulatory mechanism underlying Shp2 in regulation of HCC development.  Keywords: Shp2, SUMOylation, Gab1, ERK activation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Go to: INTRODUCTION Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accounting for 70% to 85% of the total liver cancer burden worldwide among primary liver cancers [1], is also the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the third most common cause of cancer mortality [2, 3]. Currently, curative treatment options are limited to surgical resection of the tumor or liver transplantation, with no mechanism-based therapeutic strategies available, and also relapse is common [4]. Therefore, it is urgent to understand the molecular mechanism of HCC development and look for better diagnostic and therapeutic targets and strategies for liver cancer.  SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-related Modifier) is an important post-translational modification (PTM) that belongs to a small family of protein modifiers, and regulates a vast variety of proteins in many signaling pathways [5]. SUMOylation is subject to reversible modification affecting target protein activity, stability, localization and protein-protein interaction [6], which all regulate many biochemical and physiological events such as transcriptional regulation, chromatin organization, DNA repair, signal transduction and so on [5, 6]. An increasing evidences show that SUMOylation is closely related to human diseases [7–11]. Most importantly, our group have found SUMOylation has been linked to cancer initiation and development, for examples, SUMOylation of tumor suppressors PTEN [12], Egr1 [13] and oncogenic protein Grb2 [14] regulate tumorigenesis; SUMOylation of RhoGDI (Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor) enhances cancer cell motility [15].  Src homology 2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2), which encoded by the PTPN11 gene in human, is a ubiquitously expressed non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) that contains two N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, a catalytic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) domain, and a C-terminal tail [16, 17]. Shp2 is essential for multiple cellular signaling pathways for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and motility, and embryonic development as well as hematopoietic cell development. Shp2 activating mutations have been identified in Noonan syndrome [18], juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia [19]. In addition, Shp2 over-expression is found in leukemia and breast cancer cell lines and patient samples [20, 21]. Shp2 is required for normal activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway downstream of most receptor tyrosine kinases [17, 22, 23]. Especially, the Noonan syndrome-causing Shp2 mutants can induce ERK1/2 hyper-activation in vitro and in vivo [24, 25, 26].  It has been reported that SUMO1 is over-expressed in HCC cell lines and clinical tumor samples compared to non-neoplastic liver tissues [27], and when silencing of endogenous SUMO1 in HCC cell line SMMC-7721, the growth rate is significantly inhibited [27]. These suggest SUMOylation is implicated in HCC development, however it is unclear the underlying mechanism. In this study, we found that SUMOylation of Shp2 promoted the activation of ERK signaling via facilitating the formation of Shp2-Gab1 (Grb2-associated binder-1) complex and thereby accelerated HCC cell and tumor growth, which presented a novel regulatory mechanism for Shp2 in regulation of HCC development.  Go to: RESULTS Shp2 occurs SUMOylation both in vivo and in vitro  SUMOylation is an important mechanism for modulation of cellular functions by regulating signaling pathways such as Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway. It has been revealed that MEK SUMOylation blocks ERK activation and suppresses Ras-induced cell transformation [28]. Most recently, our study demonstrated that Grb2 SUMOylation at K56 enhances the ERK activity and promotes cell motility, transformation and tumorigenesis [14]. Since Shp2, is also important for the activation of Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway, we want to examine whether Shp2 occurs SUMOylation in vivo and this is involved in ERK activation by phosphorylations. To this end, we over-expressed HA-Shp2 together with 6xHis-tagged SUMO1, RH-SUMO2 or RH-SUMO3, and Flag-tagged SUMOylation E2 ligase Ubc9 in HEK293T cells. The His/RH-tagged SUMO1 conjugates purified with Ni2+-NTA agarose beads as described before [12, 13] were immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody anti-HA. About 2∼3 of high-molecular-weight (HMW) migrating forms of HA-Shp2, corresponding to SUMOylated Shp2, were detected when co-transfected with SUMO1 or SUMO2 (very weak) but not SUMO3 (Figure ​(Figure1A).1A). Accordingly, SUMO1 modification of Shp2 was greatly enhanced by the E2 Ubc9 (Figure ​(Figure1B)1B) but attenuated by SENP1, a main de-SUMOylation enzyme for SUMO1-conjugated substrates (Figure ​(Figure1C).1C). Furthermore, SUMO1 modifications of Shp2 were significantly increased when endogenous SENP1 was knocked down by specific shRNAs for Senp1 in 293T cells (Figure ​(Figure1D).1D). Next, we investigated SUMOylation of Shp2 by using an in vitro E.coli-based SUMOylation assay by pE1E2SUMO1 [14, 29]. Co-expression of human or mouse Shp2 with pE1E2S1 in bacteria BL21 (DE3) showed that both human and mouse Shp2 were SUMOylated by SUMO1 at multiple sites but not in the E.coli transformed with GST-Shp2 alone (Figure ​(Figure1E).1E). More importantly, we confirmed that endogenous Shp2 was SUMOylated in SENP1−/− mouse brain tissues at embryonic day 13.5 by the method of immunoprecipitation (Figure ​(Figure1F).1F). Collectively, these results indicate that Shp2 is an SUMOylated protein.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Shp2 occurs SUMOylation both in vivo and in vitro K590 is a major site for Shp2 SUMOylation  Above results have shown multiple bands of SUMOylated Shp2 by SUMO1, and as known that SUMO1 is not subject to form polymeric chains in vivo [30], thus Shp2 could be SUMOylated at multiple sites. To determine SUMO-site(s) of Shp2, we performed the SUMOylation assays in 293T cells co-transfected wild-type (WT) Shp2, mutant Shp2 with Flag-Ubc9/His-SUMO1 plasmids. According to the prediction, K178, K99 and K213 are the highest score in all possible SUMOylation sites (Supplementary Figure S1A). We demonstrated none of them is a major SUMO acceptor site according to the SUMOylation assays with double or triple lysine mutated (Supplementary Figure S1B–S1C). To further identify true SUMOylation site(s) in human Shp2, we generated domain-truncated forms of Shp2 including N-SH2, C-SH2, ΔSH2 as shown in Figure ​Figure2A.2A. The SUMOylation assays showed that SUMOylation mainly occurred in the ΔSH2 truncated form (Figure ​(Figure2C)2C) whereas it was still weakly observed in both the N-SH2 and C-SH2 truncated forms (Figure ​(Figure2B).2B). Therefore, we focused on two lysines K445 and K590 in the ΔSH2 truncated form according to the prediction of SUMOplot (Supplementary Figure S1A). Our data showed that K590R but not K445R (data not shown) greatly reduced ΔSH2 SUMOylation (Figure ​(Figure2D),2D), suggesting that Shp2 can be SUMOylated at K590. To further validate K590 is a true SUMO-site in the full-length Shp2, we generated a mutant Shp2K590R to perform the SUMOylation assay in 293T cells (Figure ​(Figure2E)2E) and in vitro E.coli-based SUMOylation assay (Figure ​(Figure2F),2F), both showing that the K590R significantly reduced SUMOylation of full-length Shp2. All above data suggested that human Shp2 is majorly SUMOylated at K590, which is located in the C-terminus of Shp2. K590 lies in QKSFR that is not a classical motif ψKxD/E, nevertheless, it has been proved that SUMOylation can also occurs at lysine residues outside classical motif and not all ψKxD/E motifs are SUMOylated [31].  Figure 2 Figure 2 Shp2 is SUMOylated at multiple sites and K590 is a major SUMO-site Mutant Shp2K590R impairs tumorigenesis by downregulation of ERK activities  Since Shp2 is required for normal activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK in multiple receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways [24], we wanted to explore whether Shp2 SUMOylation affects the ERK signaling pathway. 293T cells lentiviral-stably expressing human Shp2WT or ShpK590R were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with 100 ng/mL of EGF for 5 and 10 minutes. As expected, ERK1/2 phosphorylations were strongly induced in the Shp2WT transfected cells when compared with the control vector transfected cells. However, the Shp2K590R transfected cells showed less activation of ERK1/2 compared to those in the Shp2WT transfected cells (Figure ​(Figure3A).3A). This was also confirmed by using 293T cells transiently transfected with Shp2WT or Shp2K590R plasmids together with GFP-SUMO1 and Flag-Ubc9 (Supplementary Figure S2). These data indicate the mutant Shp2K590R weakens its function in activation of ERK1/2.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Shp2K590R downregulates ERK signaling, anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis To explore whether the SUMO-site mutation of Shp2K590R affects the ERK signaling and tumorigenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, firstly we knocked down endogenous Shp2 in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells by shRNA for 3′-UTR of Shp2 mRNA, and then stably re-expressing the lenti-vector, Shp2WT or Shp2K590R in these cells by lentiviral system as described before [12], and the expression levels of Shp2 were assessed comparable by Western blotting. Above stable HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cell lines were starved for 24 h, and then treated with 100 ng/mL EGF for 5 minutes (Figure ​(Figure3B,3B, Figure ​Figure3C).3C). Consistent with the results in 293T cells (Figure ​(Figure3A),3A), re-expression of Shp2WT fully activated whereas Shp2K590R impaired ERK1/2 phosphorylations in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells treated with EGF. These data suggest that K590 of Shp2 is required for full activation of ERK signaling. Moreover, we also used HepG2 to test whether the SUMO-site K590 of Shp2 is involved in cellular transformation potential. The soft agar colony-forming assays showed that Shp2K590R suppressed the anchorage-independent growth when compared with Shp2WT (Figure ​(Figure3D,3D, Supplementary Figure S3A). Furthermore, we verified whether K590R mutation of Shp2 also influences tumor growth in vivo by injected subcutaneously the four stable SMMC-7721-shShp2 cell lines into nude mice. As expected, knockdown of endogenous Shp2 markedly suppressed tumor growth, and re-expression of Shp2WT dramatically increased tumor growth while Shp2−K590R did not affect (Figure ​(Figure3E,3E, Supplementary Figure S3B), which were consistent with soft agar results gotten from stable HepG2 cell lines (Figure ​(Figure3D).3D). Thus, these data reveal that the SUMO-site K590 of Shp2 is required for promoting tumorigenesis and HCC development by up-regulation of ERK activities.  SUMOylation of K590 at Shp2 is required for full activation of ERK  Since human Shp2 protein contains 593 amino acids and K590 is exactly located in the C-terminus of GLMQ587QQK590SFR593, we cut off 6 terminal amino acids Q588QK590SFR593 to get the truncated Shp2WT(1–587), which simulates a form of SUMO-deficient Shp2 like Shp2K590R. Similarly as Shp2K590R, the Shp2WT(1–587) indeed impaired ERK phosphorylation when transfected by the lentiviral system in SMMC-7721-shShp2 cells (Figure ​(Figure4A).4A). Next, to simulate a form of SUMOylated Shp2, we generated a Shp2K590R-SUMO1 (amino acids 2–96) fusion expression construct as described before [12] and transfect HepG2-shShp2 cells. As expected, the impaired ERK phosphorylations by the point mutation of K590R was rescued by Shp2K590R-SUMO1 fusion (Figure ​(Figure4B).4B). These data suggest that full activation of ERK probably requires SUMO1 modification of Shp2.  Figure 4 Figure 4 SUMOylation of K590 at Shp2 promotes ERK activation To verify this hypothesis, we knocked down SUMO1 expression in both HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells (Supplementary Figure S4A) using a short hairpin RNA to block SUMOylation system. Knockdown of SUMO1 did not affect Shp2 expression or protein stability according to the assessment as comparable by Western blotting, however notably inhibited EGF-induced ERK activation in SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells (Figure ​(Figure4C).4C). Moreover, we generated stable SMMC-7721-shSUMO1 and HepG2-shSUMO1 cell lines expressing Shp2WT and Shp2K590R. Differences in ERK activation (Figure ​(Figure4D)4D) and soft agar colony formation (Figure ​(Figure4E,4E, Supplementary Figure S4B) by Shp2WT and Shp2K590R were no longer significant. Thus, these data demonstrate that SUMOylation of Shp2 at K590 is required for full activation of ERK and HCC development.  Differential effects between human and mouse Shp2 on ERK activation by SUMOylation  Given that SUMO motif sequences are highly conserved [14], we further studied the conservation of the major SUMO site K590 at human Shp2 (hShp2) in 46 different species. The corresponding lysine is highly conserved in 44 species, but very surprisingly, there are two exceptions that it is arginine594 (R594) at both mouse and rat Shp2 instead of the lysine corresponding to K590 of hShp2 (Supplementary Figure S5). Notably, the SUMOylation level of mouse Shp2 (mShp2) is lower than that of hShp2 according to the SUMOylation assay in vivo (Figure ​(Figure5A).5A). This was also confirmed by the in vitro E.coli-based SUMOylation assay with pE1E2S1GST (Figure ​(Figure5B).5B). Since hShp2 shares 98% homology of amino acids with mShp2, we speculated the low SUMOylation level of mShp2 was probably due to its R594 in replace of K. To confirm this, we mutated mShp2 by R594 to K and performed the SUMOylation assay in 293T cells, showing the results that this mutation indeed clearly increased the SUMOylation level compared to mShp2WT (Figure ​(Figure5C).5C). Next, we generated stable 293T cells expressing mShp2WT and mShp2R594K, and observed that the levels of EGF-stimulated ERK phosphorylations by mShp2WT were lower than those by hShp2WT, but comparable to those by hShp2K590R. Most interestingly, mShp2R594K rescued the levels of ERK phosphorylations similar to those by hShp2WT (Figure ​(Figure5D).5D). Taken together, these data reveal that differential effects between hShp2 and mShp2 on ERK activation are caused by different SUMOylation levels, which are determined by the event of K590 of hShp2 substituted by R594 of mShp2.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Human and mouse Shp2 have differential effects on EGF-stimulated ERK activation as a result of different SUMOylation levels To figure out why different SUMOylation levels between hShp2 and mShp2 had differential effects on ERK activation, we also transiently expressed hShp2 or mShp2 in 293T cells, respectively. Lysates were used for immunoblotting analysis, showing that the levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylations by hShp2 were also higher than those by mShp2 (Figure ​(Figure5E).5E). The same lysates were used for immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibody against HA for HA-Shp2, and then performed the Shp2 phosphatase activity assays. However, the results showed that there was no significant difference in catalytic activity between hShp2 and mShp2 (Figure ​(Figure5F).5F). Moreover, we also performed the same above experiments with plasmids mShp2WT and mShp2R594K, and showed similar results (Figure 5G–5H). Thus, these data suggest that the effect of Shp2 SUMOylation on ERK activation is not connected to the catalytic activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain of Shp2 in vitro.  Shp2 SUMOylation promotes ERK activation by controlling its association with Gab1  Our above results have proven that Shp2 SUMOylation is crucial for maintaining the ERK activities, sequentially resulting in cellular transformation and enhanced tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo, so next we wanted to explore the underlying mechanism. Our previous studies demonstrate that SUMOylation of PTEN facilitates its association with the membrane and mediates PTEN functions [12], also one study reported that Shp2 membrane-localization is activating on ERK phosphorylation in an EGFR-dependent manner [32]. To determine whether Shp2 SUMOylation indeed influences its membrane association, we conducted a cellular fractionation assay with SMMC-7721-shShp2 cell lines stably re-expressing HA-Shp2WT or HA-Shp2K590R after stimulation with EGF for 5 min, showing that Shp2K590R in the membrane fraction was notably reduced compared to that of Shp2WT (Figure ​(Figure6A).6A). This result indicates that Shp2 SUMOylation is required for the recruitment of Shp2 to the plasma membrane to regulate RAS/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway.  Figure 6 Figure 6 SUMOyaltion of Shp2 promotes ERK activation by controlling its association with Gab1 As known, in the signaling pathway of EGF-stimulated ERK phosphorylations, Shp2 association with EGFR on the plasma membrane through Grb2-associated binder 1 (Gab1) promotes Shp2 activity, leading to ERK activation through dephosphorylation of an RASGAP binding site on Gab1 [32]. Giving that Shp2 SUMOylation is required for ERK full activation, we firstly asked whether Shp2 SUMOylation is regulated by cell growth factors such as EGF. However Shp2 SUMOylation was not induced by EGF (Supplementary Figure S6). Therefore, one possibility is that the adapter Gab1, which is most closely related with the activation of the RAS/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway in the presence of different signal factors, interacts with SUMOylated form of Shp2 more strongly than with unSUMOylated form. To verify this hypothesis, stable 293T-shSENP1 (SENP1 knockdown for increasing SUMOylation) or -shControl cells were transfected with HA-Shp2 and Flag-Gab1. The result of Western blotting followed by Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) showed the binding of Gab1 and Shp2 in 293T-shSENP1 cells was indeed significantly increased compared to that in 293T-shControl cells (Figure ​(Figure6B),6B), suggesting that Gab1 can recruit more Shp2 that is highly SUMOylated by knockdown of SENP1. To more confirm this, lysates from stable cell lines SMMC-7721-shShp2 expressing hShp2WT or hShp2K590R treated with EGF for 5 minutes were used for Co-IP with the antibody against Gab1, and then immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody, showing that the SUMO-site mutation K590R of hShp2 obviously reduced Shp2 binding with Gab1 when compared with Shp2WT (Figure ​(Figure6C).6C). Whereas the same above experiments were also repeated by using stable cell lines SMMC-7721-shSUMO1 expressing hShp2WT or hShp2K590R, we observed there was no difference in binding of Gab1 with hShp2WT or hShp2K590R (Figure ​(Figure6D).6D). More convincingly, we performed two assays of GST-fusion protein pull-down and opposite immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody, in which Flag-Gab1 was transiently expressed in 293T cells and GST-Shp2 proteins were SUMOylated by the E.coli-based pE1E2S1, and showed SUMOylated GST-hShp2WT bound with more Flag-Gab1 than that of hShp2K590R (Figure ​(Figure6E).6E). Consistent with this, as shown in Figure ​Figure6F6F Gab1 has SUMO1 binding activity, which was abolished when its two SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) [33] were mutated. Taken together, our results demonstrated that SUMOylated Shp2 can be more effectively recruited by Gab1 to the membrane, thereby leading to the activation of the RAS/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway.  Go to: DISCUSSION Here we report that Shp2 is covalently modified by SUMO1 at multiple sites, and K590 is the major SUMO acceptor site. Importantly, SUMO1 modification at K590 of hShp2 increased Shp2 binding to the Gab1, although having no effect on its catalytic activity, promoting EGF-stimulated ERK activation and increasing HCC cell anchorage-independent growth and xenograft tumor growth, which reveals a new mechanism for the regulation of Shp2 function in Ras/ERK signaling pathway (Figure ​(Figure77).  Figure 7 Figure 7 Model for the Shp2 SUMOylation in ERK pathway The Ras/ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in mediating cellular responses to growth factors and cytokines, and it is highly conserved from lower eukaryotes to mammals during evolution [34]. Each step of the linear signaling cascade in the ERK pathway can be modulated by other components. Under stimulation of EGF, the activated Shp2 is rapidly recruited to the activated receptor EGFR by directly binding to the phospho-Tyrosine residues within their cytoplasmic regions and/or through formation of protein complex between Shp2 and adaptor proteins, such as Grb2 and Gab1. We found that highly SUMOylated Shp2 had stronger affinity to Gab1, thus more easily forming Shp2-Gab1 complex at the plasma membrane, these may explain why SUMOylation of Shp2 effectively promotes ERK activation even though the total SUMOylation of Shp2 seems to be relatively low. The constitutive association of Shp2-Gab1 complex enhanced by SUMOylation of Shp2 is anticipated resulting in a constitutively elevated ERK activity in cells and promoting HCC development.  We put forward a new point of view on functional difference between human Shp2 and mouse/rat Shp2 in regulation of ERK signaling pathway. Shp2 are highly conserved, but human Shp2 was more active in increasing ERK phosphorylation compared to mouse/rat Shp2 on EGF stimulation, suggesting that human Shp2 has stronger effect on ERK signaling compared to mouse/rat Shp2. We compared the levels of SUMO modification between human Shp2 and mouse Shp2 using Ni2+-NTA pull-down and GST pull-down assays, and found this difference consistent with ERK activity in 293T cells. Mutation of R594 to K which could be SUMOylated in theory can successfully rescue both mouse Shp2 SUMOylation and ERK activation. This is for the first time that human and mouse Shp2 had differential effects on EGF-stimulated ERK activation as a result of the different SUMOylation levels, suggesting that some animal models (mouse/rat) of human disease should be carefully evaluated, at least like the study for Shp2 related disease.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies and reagents  Antibodies against Shp2 (B-1), IGF-IRβ (H-60), Gab1 (H198) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA); antibodies against phospho-Shp2 pY542 (#2184–1), phospho-EGFR pY1068 (#1138–1) were from Epitomics (Burlingame, CA, USA).

GAPDH (#ab37168), SUMO1 [Y299] (#ab32058) antibody were from Abcam. Antibodies against Flag (M2) and HA (16B12) were from Sigma and Covance, respectively. Protein G Plus/Protein A agarose suspension (#IP05) and Recombin-ant Human Epidermal Growth Factor (rHu EGF) were purchased from Calbiochem. Puromycin (P8833) was from Sigma.  Plasmids and transfection  The expression plasmid pEF-HA-Shp2 was previously described [35], and the mutant Shp2K590R was generated using PCR-directed mutagenesis and sequenced. The wild-type or mutated HA-Shp2 was cloned into the Lentiviral vector pCDH carrying puromycin and EGFP genes [12]. The hShp2 cDNA was cloned into the vector pGEX4T1 to generate a construct GST-Shp2. The shRNA sequence targeting Shp2 3′-UTR (shShp2) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich ‘Mission shRNA’ online: 5-gcagttaaattgtgcgctgta-3′. The shRNA was cloned into pGreenpuro vector (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). The Flag-Gab1 cDNA was cloned into the vector pcDNA3 to generate the Flag tagged Gab1 expression vector. The HA-Shp2-SUMO1 fusion construct was generated by fusion of SUMO1 (2∼96 aa) to the C-terminal of Shp2. The pE1E2S1 plasmid was generous gift from Dr. Jiemin Wong in East China Normal University.  To establish stable cell lines expressing HA-Shp2 or its mutants, the lentiviral expression vectors pCDH-Vector, pCDH-HA-Shp2WT or pCDH-HA-Shp2K590R together with the packaging plasmids (pMD2G+pCMVdR8) were transfected into 293FT cells by using Lipofectamine 2000. The supernatants were harvested 48 hours, and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3000 × RPM. HepG2, SMMC-7721 and SMMC-7721-shShp2 (endogenous Shp2 knockdown by shRNA) cells were incubated with viral supernatants plus equal complete medium in the presence of 5 μg/mL of polybrene (Sigma) for 24 hours. After infection, stable cell lines were selected with 5∼10 μg/mL of puromycin for 3∼4 days.  All primer sequences are showed in Supplementary Table S1.  Cell cultures  Human embryonic kidney 293T and 293FT, HeLa, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. HCC SMMC-7721 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (Hyclone) containing 10% FBS. For EGF stimulation, HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were incubated in serum free medium DMEM or RPMI1640 for 24 and 30 hours, and then 100 ng/mL of EGF was added for 5 or 10 minutes at 37°C. Cell transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).  SUMOylation assays  Shp2 SUMOylation was analysed in HEK293T by the method of in vivo SUMOylation assay using Ni2+-NTA agarose beads as previously described [12–14]. Shp2 SUMOylation analysis was also performed by the method of in vitro E.coli BL21-based SUMOylation assay with the plasmid pE1E2S1 as described [14, 29].  Soft agar colony forming assay  The method was described before [12, 14]. This assay was performed in six-well plates in triple with a base of 2 mL of medium containing 5% FBS with 0.6% Bacto agar (Amresco). Stable HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were seeded in 2 mL of medium containing 5% FBS with 0.35% agar at 5 × 103 or 2 × 103 cells per well and layered onto the base, respectively, the photographs of the colonies developed in soft agar were taken and the number of colonies were scored by Photoshop about 20 days after seeding. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate.  Extraction of membrane/cytosol fractions  The extractions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions of FractionPREPTM Cell Fractionation kit (BioVision, CA, USA). A total of 8 × 106 cells were used for each extraction, and both subcellular fractions were further resuspended in 300 μL of buffer, and 30 μL per lane of each cytosolic and membranous protein fractions were loaded on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. For the loading control, the antibodies against IGF-Iβ as a membrane marker and GAPDH as a cytosolic marker were used [12].  Shp2 phosphatase activity assays  This method was described before [32, 36] and modified. Briefly, SMM-7721 or HEK293T cells were stimulated by EGF after starvation, then lysed in pre-cold RIPA buffer immediately. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody plus protein A/G plus agarose beads overnight at 4°C, and then beads were washed with RIPA buffer for 4 times and split into two equal fractions. One fraction was washed with a phosphatase assay buffer, 25 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5 mM EDTA, and resuspended in 100 μL of phosphatase assay buffer containing 120 μM 6, 8-difluoro-4-methylum-belliferyl phosphate (Invitrogen) at 37°C for 30 min, during the incubation period, shaken the tube to mix the beads every 5 minutes. After a brief centrifugation, supernatants were transferred into a non-transparent 96-well plate and the fluorescence signal was measured at an excitation of 360 nm and an emission of 460 nm, respectively. Beads from the other fraction as controls were boiled for Western blotting analysis.  Xenografted tumor models in vivo  To establish xenografts of liver cancer cells (SMMC-7721), 5-week-old male BALB/c nude mice (n > 5) were injected subcutaneously in the right flank with 2 × 106 cells in 100 μL Opti-MEM. One week after injection, the tumors were measured every 3 days. Mice were sacrificed after 18 days after implantation, tumor xenografts were dissected and weighed.  Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E)  Paraffin-embedded sample preparation, hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) were performed as previously describe [13].  Immunoprecipitation (IP)  Cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were lysed in the RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 mM N-ethylmaleimide with protease inhibitor cocktail tablet) on ice. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with the HA monoclonal antibody (Convance) overnight at 4°C and subjected to 8∼10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for Western blotting analysis.  Western blot  Cells were lysed in SDS-lysis buffer (25.6 mM Tris, 2% SDS, pH 6.8), and total protein concentrations were determined by Nanodrop 2000. About 100 μg of each total protein was resolved on 8∼10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride filters (Millipore). The membrane was subsequently probed with the indicated primary antibodies and second antibodies, and then exposured in ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE) after incubating with ECL substrate, then analyzed band intensities of the images with the Photoshop CS5 and Image J. The antibody against Gab1 was used at a 1:250 dilution, other primary antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution. All secondary antibodies were used at a 1:5000 dilution. 
3109||Epigenetic changes are among the most common alterations observed in cancer cells, yet the mechanism by which cancer cells acquire and maintain abnormal DNA methylation patterns is not understood. Cancer cells have an altered distribution of DNA methylation and express aberrant DNA methyltransferase 3B transcripts, which encode truncated proteins, some of which lack the C-terminal catalytic domain. To test if a truncated DNMT3B isoform disrupts DNA methylation in vivo, we constructed two lines of transgenic mice expressing DNMT3B7, a truncated DNMT3B isoform commonly found in cancer cells. DNMT3B7 transgenic mice exhibit altered embryonic development, including lymphopenia, craniofacial abnormalities, and cardiac defects, similar to Dnmt3b-deficient animals, but rarely develop cancer. However, when DNMT3B7 transgenic are bred with Eμ-Myc transgenic mice, which model aggressive B cell lymphoma, DNMT3B7 expression increases the frequency of mediastinal lymphomas in Eμ-Myc animals. Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mediastinal lymphomas have more chromosomal rearrangements, increased global DNA methylation levels, and more locus-specific perturbations in DNA methylation patterns compared to Eμ-Myc lymphomas. These data represent the first in vivo modeling of cancer-associated DNA methylation changes and suggest that truncated DNMT3B isoforms contribute to the re-distribution of DNA methylation characterizing virtually every human tumor.  Go to: Introduction Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, play an important role in cellular gene regulation (1). Highly methylated DNA is typically transcriptionally inactive, whereas hypomethylated DNA is associated with active, open chromatin (2). Repetitive DNA is usually highly methylated and transcriptionally silenced, effectively inactivating transposable elements that could mediate genomic rearrangements. The distribution of DNA methylation is highly regulated during development and can become altered during aging and malignant transformation (1, 3). Repetitive DNA sequences and some gene promoters are hypomethylated in tumors compared to normal cells, and the promoters of many tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated (1). These changes contribute to the abnormalities in genetic/chromosomal stability, growth control, and apoptosis observed in tumor cells.  Three DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes have been identified in eukaryotic cells (4). DNMT1 is generally considered to be a maintenance methyltransferase, although it also has de novo methyltransferase activity (4). Both DNMT3A and DNMT3B catalyze de novo methylation of DNA sequences (5).  The mechanism(s) by which cancer cells acquire abnormal DNA methylation is not understood completely, but aberrant transcription of the DNMT3B gene is widespread across all human cancer cells studied to date (6). Most of the DNMT3B transcripts found in cancer cells encode catalytically active DNMT3B proteins, but aberrant splicing also produces DNMT3B transcripts containing premature stop codons, which encode truncated proteins lacking the catalytic domain (7). Expression of one of the most commonly expressed aberrant transcripts, DNMT3B7, within 293 cells resulted in hypermethylation of some promoters (e.g. CDH1) and hypomethylation of others (e.g. MAGEA3) in a manner similar to that seen in cancer cells (7). Other transcripts identified in non-small cell lung cancer, the ΔDNMT3B1-7 transcripts, are generated from a promoter internal to the DNMT3B gene (8–10). Additionally, another splice variant termed DNMT3B3Δ5 is highly expressed in induced pluripotent stem cells and displays variable levels of expression in human tumor cells lines depending on the tissue of origin (11).  Altered expression of DNMT3B can also play a role in disease states other than cancer. About half of patients with a rare autosomal recessive syndrome, the Immunodeficiency; Centromere instability; Facial anomalies (ICF) Syndrome, have detectable germline mutations in DNMT3B (12) and display hypomethylation of pericentromeric repetitive DNA. Additionally, mice lacking each of the Dnmts (13, 14) and mice expressing ICF mutations (15) demonstrate hypomethylation of repetitive elements and embryonic lethality and/or developmental abnormalities, all of which substantiate the central role of DNA methylation during embryonic and early post-natal development.  The widespread expression of truncated DNMT3B proteins in human cancers as well as the alteration in DNA methylation seen in vitro with forced expression of DNMT3B7 (7) suggested that truncated DNMT3B proteins could alter DNA methylation within cancer cells. Furthermore, the identification of truncated DNMT3B isoforms consisting of the N-terminal domain within the human ICF Syndrome gave additional support to the hypothesis that truncated DNMT3B proteins have a physiologic effect. The work we present here tests whether DNMT3B7, one of the truncated DNMT3B isoforms found in human tumors, can disrupt mouse development and alter tumorigenesis by inducing changes in DNA methylation.  Go to: Materials and Methods Generation of transgenic mice and monitoring of tumors  The DNMT3B7 transgenic mice were generated using standard techniques (see Supplementary Materials and Methods).  Reverse transcription and PCR amplification  Total RNA was made using STAT-60 (Tel-Test) or Trizol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScriptII (Invitrogen), and PCR amplifications were performed using AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems), using primers listed in Supplementary Table S1.  Western blotting  Protein extracts were made as previously described (7), and Western blots were performed with the following antibodies: anti-Dnmt3b: T-16, sc-10236, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; or ab2851, Abcam; anti-UBC9: N-15, sc-5231, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-lamin B: M-20, sc-6217, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-α-tubulin: T9026, Sigma-Aldrich; anti-FLAG: F3165, Sigma-Aldrich. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-HA antibody: clone 3F10, 11867423001, Roche Applied Science.  Flow cytometry and serum immunoglobulin level analysis  Flow cytometry using a BD FACSCanto was performed using antibodies from BD Pharmingen: PE anti-mouse B220 (553089), APC anti-mouse IgM (550676), PE anti-mouse CD4 (553730), and APC anti-mouse CD8 (17-0081-81). Serum immunoglobulin levels were performed in triplicate using the SBA Clonotyping™ System/HRP (Southern Biotech).  Generation and growth curve analysis of mediastinal lymphoma cell lines  Primary B cell cultures were generated as described (16).  Cytogenetic analysis  Cytogenetic analysis was performed on fresh single cell suspensions from mediastinal lymphomas as described (17).  Analysis of 5-methylcytosine levels  Genomic DNA was hydrolyzed and analyzed in triplicate for the relative levels of 5-methyldeoxycytidine by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (18).  Gene expression studies  RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), purified by the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 gene expression microarrays at The University of Chicago Functional Genomics Facility. For details regarding data analysis, see Supplementary Materials and Methods.  DNA methylation analysis  Genomic DNA was isolated using the AquaPure Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (Bio-Rad). The HELP assay was performed (19), with details provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software R 2.8.1 (20). These data can be found at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website under accession number GSE21273 (21). PCR primers used to amplify sodium bisulfite-treated DNA are given in Supplementary Table S2.  Go to: Results DNMT3B7 expression in a transgenic mouse model  To test our hypothesis that a cancer-related DNMT3B isoform could disrupt DNA methylation in vivo, we engineered transgenic mice to express DNMT3B7, an isoform consisting of the first 360 N-terminal amino acids of DNMT3B (Fig. 1A). Because cancer cells overexpress full-length DNMT3B transcripts in addition to the aberrant forms, we chose to express DNMT3B7 using transgenic mice to avoid disrupting endogenous murine Dnmt3b expression. We were concerned that widespread DNMT3B7 expression might disrupt embryonic development or cause reproductive defects, since treatment of mice with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a hypomethylating agent, renders them infertile (22). Therefore, we designed the transgenic construct (Fig. 1A) using the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer and promoter with the goal of achieving lymphocyte-specific expression in adult animals. Lymphocytes are very sensitive to changes in DNA methylation, since mice expressing a hypomorphic Dnmt1 allele develop aggressive T cell lymphomas (23, 24).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Phenotypic abnormalities of DNMT3B7 transgenic mice. A, Top, Schematic diagram of DNMT3B, and the DNMT3B7 isoform. Numbers indicate positions of amino acids (aa). N, N-terminus; C, C-terminus; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PWWP domain, conserved proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline ... From our transgenic construct, we obtained eight independent founder animals, six of which were sterile. From the remaining two founders, we generated two lines of DNMT3B7 transgenic mice, Line A and Line C. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the Line A transgene insertion site to chromosome 5, band G1, and the Line C transgene insertion site to chromosome 16, band C1–C2 (data not shown). The endogenous genes Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3l are located on other chromosomes, so the transgene insertions could not have resulted directly in Dnmt hypomorphic alleles.  DNMT3B7 transgenic mice show developmental abnormalities  Each line of DNMT3B7 mice displayed developmental abnormalities, the severity of which depended on whether the transgene array was present in the hemizygous or homozygous state. DNMT3B7 mice were smaller than their littermates (Supplementary Fig. S1), and had craniofacial, cardiac, and immune defects (Fig. 1A–D), described in more detail below. The most severely affected Line C homozygotes died between E8.5–E9.5, and Line A homozygotes died within hours of birth (Supplementary Table S3). We observed similar phenotypes in both lines, although they were generally more severe in Line C, suggesting that the phenotypes are a direct result of transgene expression, rather than the result of position effects.  DNMT3B7 is expressed dynamically during embryogenesis  RNA in situ hybridizations demonstrated DNMT3B7 expression during embryogenesis, with widespread expression at E9.5, becoming more restricted with advanced development (Supplementary Fig. S2A–D). We also compared the expression of DNMT3B7 to endogenous levels of Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3l by RT-PCR in embryos from E7.5–E10.5 (Fig. 2A). Overall, we observed very low levels of DNMT3B7 expression beginning at E7.5, with a sharp increase in expression at E10.5. Each of the endogenous Dnmts was expressed at much higher levels than the transgene and at levels comparable to those seen in wild-type embryos at the same ages (Supplementary Fig. S2E). DNMT3B7 expression was also observed in adult animals in lymphoid tissues, as expected from the use of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer and promoter, as well as in brain and testis (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S2F–H).  Figure 2 Figure 2 DNMT3B7 expression in Line A and Line C by RT-PCR. A, RT-PCR amplification in DNMT3B7 transgenic embryos from E7.5–E10.5. The positive control (Pos) is from a Line A hemizygous embryo at E15.5. Molecular weight markers are indicated to the left. ... DNMT3B7 transgenic mice have craniofacial, cardiac, and immune defects  The craniofacial abnormalities that were observed in the DNMT3B7 mice included cleft palate and severe microphthalmia on the right, with a normal appearing eye on the left (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S4). Cardiac abnormalities, including side-by-side great vessels, thin myocardium, and sub-aortic ventricular septal defects (VSDs), the same type of VSD observed in Dnmt3b−/− mice (15), were also observed in both lines of DNMT3B7 mice (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Table S5). Some animals with severe craniofacial defects had a normal heart (Supplementary Table S6), suggesting some variation in the effects on the cells giving rise to these structures. Similar to what has been observed in humans with ICF syndrome and ICF mutant mice, Line A homozygous animals exhibited lymphopenia and immunodeficiency, with lower numbers of total and mature B lymphocytes and lower IgA levels in the peripheral blood (Fig. 1D).  DNMT3B7 interacts with DNMT3B in 293 cells and leads to chromosomal rearrangements  Since the phenotypes of DNMT3B7 mice are similar to some of the defects seen in Dnmt3b−/− embryos (15), we wanted to test the interaction of DNMT3B7 with full-length DNMT3B. We found that DNMT3B7 can co-immunoprecipitate with DNMT3B, suggesting that DNMT3B7 may be binding to Dnmt3b and disrupting its normal function in transgenic mice (Supplementary Fig. S3) (see Discussion). DNMT3B7 expression led to increased numbers of chromosomal rearrangements of the pericentromeric region of chromosome 15 as well as hypomethylation of a repetitive element located in the region of the chromosomal rearrangements (Supplementary Fig. S4).  DNMT3B7 transgenic mice rarely develop spontaneous cancer  Given the frequent expression of truncated DNMT3B isoforms in human cancers, we followed the DNMT3B7 mice closely for the development of hematopoietic tumors. Out of approximately sixty animals followed over one year, we observed only one spontaneous tumor, an erythroleukemia that developed in a 43 week old Line A DNMT3B7 hemizygous female (Supplementary Fig. S5). We estimate the frequency of leukemia development at 1–2% at one year, which is greater than the rate of spontaneous development of erythroleukemia in C57Bl/6J mice, estimated at <1% (25).  DNMT3B7 expression alters the kinetics of mediastinal lymphoma formation in Eμ-Myc transgenic mice  Given the rarity of cancer development in DNMT3B7 mice, we tested whether DNMT3B7 expression could alter tumorigenesis in Eμ-Myc transgenic mice, in which 94% of the transgenic mice develop B cell lymphomas by 4 months of age (26). Although the majority of Eμ-Myc mice develop peripheral lymphomas, about 7% develop mediastinal lymphomas (27). Since we observe aberrant transcription of DNMT3B in all human tumors tested, we first investigated whether Eμ-Myc-induced lymphomas themselves expressed aberrant Dnmt3b transcripts. RT-PCR for Dnmt3b within Eμ-Myc transgenic tumors demonstrated no aberrant Dnmt3b transcription (data not shown).  We introduced DNMT3B7 expression into Eμ-Myc mice by crossing them to the DNMT3B7 Line A transgenic mice. Approximately 30 Eμ-Myc and 30 Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice were followed longitudinally for tumor development. We found that the incidence of mediastinal lymphomas in Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice was much higher than in Eμ-Myc mice (Fig. 3A), with more than 50% of these mice developing mediastinal lymphomas within the first 120 days. Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice generated with the Line C insertion also developed mediastinal tumors early, although a large cohort was not followed (data not shown). In contrast, only about 20% of Eμ-Myc mice developed mediastinal lymphomas, the majority of which occurred after 120 days. Both Eμ-Myc and Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice developed peripheral lymphomas at similar rates (data not shown). RT-PCR confirmed expression of DNMT3B7 in Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 transgenic tumors (Fig. 2B).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Kinetics and DNA methylation levels of mediastinal lymphomas from Eμ-Myc versus Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 transgenic mice. A, Cumulative incidence curves for the development of mediastinal lymphomas in Eμ-Myc (solid line) versus Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 ... Cell lines generated from mediastinal lymphomas (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S2I) showed that cells derived from Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mediastinal lymphomas grew three times more rapidly than those from Eμ-Myc tumors (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, there was no difference in the number of total circulating lymphocytes (Supplementary Table S7) or in the percentage of B lymphocytes in DNMT3B7 mice (Supplementary Fig. S6). Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of DNMT3B7 alters the process of tumorigenesis in the Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice rather than increasing the susceptible cell population.  Mediastinal lymphomas from Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice have increased genetic instability  Tumor histology demonstrated that the lymphomas, bone marrows, and spleens from Eμ-Myc and Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice were indistinguishable, showing sheets of large, blast-like cells with large diffuse nuclei (data not shown). Likewise, the tumors of Eμ-Myc and Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 both expressed pre-B cell (B220) and mature B cell markers (IgM) (data not shown). Spectral karyotyping (SKY) analysis demonstrated that Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 tumors had an average of 5.6 clonal abnormalities, significantly higher than the 1.75 average clonal abnormalities in the Eμ-Myc tumors (Table 1), suggesting that DNMT3B7 expression promotes chromosomal instability.  Table 1 Table 1 Cytogenetic analysis from Eμ-Myc and Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 transgenic mediastinal lymphomas. DNMT3B7 affects global DNA methylation levels in a tumor background  Using mass spectrometry to quantitate total 5-methylcytosine levels, there was little difference in the amount of methylated cytosine in genomic DNA from peripheral blood B and T lymphocytes derived from wild-type and DNMT3B7 transgenic mice (Fig. 3C). However, there was a significant increase in the amount of DNA methylation in Eμ-Myc-induced tumors, with a further increase seen in mediastinal tumors from Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice. Cell lines generated from mediastinal tumors of those mice also recapitulated this difference.  Mediastinal lymphomas from Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice demonstrate gene expression changes associated with corresponding DNA methylation alterations  Gene expression changes in mediastinal tumors from two Eμ-Myc and three Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice were measured by the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarray. A P value of 0.05, and a false discovery rate of 0.01 were used as thresholds to perform supervised clustering, identifying 328 genes that distinguished Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 tumors from Eμ-Myc tumors (Supplementary Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S7).  To test if the differential expression of genes in the lymphomas of Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice was the result of an alteration in their DNA methylation patterns, we performed bisulfite sequencing of selected genes demonstrating a >1.2 fold change that also had a CpG island in the region surrounding their transcriptional start site. Percent methylation at each CpG position was determined by sequencing PCR amplicons in bulk and calculating the ratio of C to T. Thrap2, Bri3bp, and Mum1 had between a 1.8–3.5-fold increase in gene expression in Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 lymphomas (Supplementary Table S8; confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR shown in Supplementary Fig. S8), and each gene had regions of hypomethylation within their respective CpG islands/promoters (Fig. 4).  Figure 4 Figure 4 DNA methylation changes in specific genes from gene expression profiling of mediastinal lymphomas. Methylation changes were assessed by bisulfite sequencing in the CpG islands of A, Thrap2; B, Bri3bp; and C, Mum1. Schematic diagrams for each gene are ... We also measured DNA methylation by performing a microarray-based assay, HELP (HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR) (19, 28–30) on mediastinal lymphomas from Eμ-Myc versus Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice. We validated several genes in Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mediastinal lymphomas that demonstrated changes in their DNA methylation profiles, one of which was hypomethylated (Irs4), and others that were hypermethylated (Galnt3 and Sfrs8) (Supplementary Fig. S9 and data not shown). We also performed the HELP assay on DNA from the brain, to measure DNA methylation perturbations in a non-tumor tissue. In contrast to the mediastinal lymphomas, we observed fewer genes with DNA methylation changes in the brains of DNMT3B7 mice. We found only moderate changes at CpG dinucleotides that are part of HpaII sites in Ubfd1, as well as in its CpG island (Supplementary Fig. S10).  In addition to uncovering consistent changes in DNA methylation, the HELP assay revealed significant heterogeneity in the DNA methylation profiles of particular CpG dinucleotides within individual Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 tumors as measured by an increase in the gene methylation standard deviation across these tumors, whereas the Eμ-Myc lymphomas had much more consistent DNA methylation patterns (Fig. 5A). This variability in DNA methylation among the Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 tumors was observed for individual genes (e.g. Mnt and Supt4h2) identified by the HELP assay and validated using bisulfite sequencing, in which the variability was quantified by calculating the coefficient of variance (CV) (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S9). For example, in Notch1 (Figure 5B), at the CpG at position 8 in Eμ-Myc tumors, the amount of methylation varies between 39–44% in each tumor, with a CV of 5. However, in Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 tumors, methylation of this CpG dinucleotide varies from 0–57%, with a significantly higher CV of 93, reflecting the generalized deregulation in DNA methylation patterns observed in these tumors.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Increased variability in DNA methylation of particular CpG dinucleotides within gene promoters is observed in mediastinal lymphomas of Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice. A, Left, Standard deviation of the signal density obtained from the HpaII channel of the ... This high degree of variability in DNA methylation levels was seen in the CpG islands/promoters of genes identified through gene expression profiling as well. Specifically, Notch1, Foxp4, and Sox4 showed increased expression levels (Supplementary Table S8) in double transgenic tumors and were generally hypomethylated. Each showed a high degree of variability in which specific CpG dinucleotides displayed hypomethylation as well as in the degree of DNA methylation at those positions (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S9D-E). We also observed DNA methylation changes in the “CpG island shore” (3) of Notch1 (Supplementary Fig. S9F). Additionally, other genes, such as Ell2, which were underexpressed (Supplementary Table S8), showed an increase in DNA methylation of their CpG islands/promoters, again with variability in the DNA methylation profile (Fig. 5D). This observation argues in favor of a generalized perturbation of DNA methylation in the Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 lymphomas.  Go to: Discussion Human tumors are characterized by a re-distribution of DNA methylation, enabling “DNA methylation signatures” to be described for many cancers (30–32). Our work tests the hypothesis that a truncated DNMT3B isoform commonly found in human cancer cells, DNMT3B7, can alter DNA methylation. Our findings of disrupted mammalian development and accelerated lymphomagenesis with increased chromosomal instability and perturbed DNA methylation patterns supports the hypothesis that truncated DNMT3B proteins can disrupt DNA methylation and alter tumorigenesis in vivo.  The precise embryonic defects that we observe in two independent lines of transgenic mice, craniofacial abnormalities, ventricular septal defects, and lymphopenia, are reminiscent of those seen in Dnmt3b-deficient animals. Mice lacking Dnmt3b die prior to E14.5, with sub-aortic ventricular septal defects identical to those seen in DNMT3B7 animals (14). In addition, mice expressing ICF Syndrome-associated mutations within the catalytic domain survive birth, but display low body weight, craniofacial malformations, and T cell apoptosis (15). Furthermore, human ICF patients have documented developmental abnormalities, including ventricular or atrial septal defects, cleft palate, and immunodeficiency, with decreased levels of IgA, IgM, and IgG2 (12). Notably, three of the described DNMT3B mutations in patients with ICF Syndrome are premature termination mutations within the 5′ end of the gene, like those in cancer cells: Q42Term, R54Term, and Q204Term. DNMT3B7 consists of the first 360 amino acids of the full-length protein and may possess a biologic activity similar to the ICF-associated isoforms.  Given the potential of DNMT3B7 to disrupt DNMT function, one possible outcome of expression of a truncated DNMT3B isoform was the development of lymphoma or another hematopoietic tumor. Interestingly, mice transplanted with hematopoietic progenitors deficient in Lsh, a chromatin remodeling protein known to bind Dnmt3b, develop erythroleukemia (33), the same type of leukemia that developed spontaneously within our colony. However, the fact that DNMT3B7 transgenic mice do not themselves have a strong predisposition to tumor formation argues that the expression of a truncated DNMT3B protein does not provide a major oncogenic stimulus.  In contrast, when placed in the context of c-Myc, the effects of DNMT3B7 expression are profound, with alterations of many tumor features, including tumor spectrum, kinetics, cytogenetic abnormalities, and DNA methylation distribution. The Eμ-Myc tumors showed only chromosomal gains, as shown previously (34). In contrast, the Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mediastinal tumors demonstrated complex cytogenetic abnormalities involving multiple chromosomes, including polyploidy, translocations, insertions, and chromosomal losses in addition to gains, . similar to the types of chromosomal changes seen in human tumors. Although DNMT3B7 expression leads to chromosomal instability and DNA hypomethylation in some contexts (Supplementary Fig. S4), current technology makes it difficult to determine the specific regions or loci contributing to increased global DNA methylation in Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 tumors.  Our results suggest that the introduction of DNMT3B7 promotes large-scale disarray in DNA methylation changes in Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mediastinal tumors that, in turn, induce changes in gene expression that promote mediastinal lymphomagenesis. DNA methylation alterations included genes with hypermethylation within their promoters as well as others that became hypomethylated. For some genes, we observed a high degree of individual variability in the DNA methylation changes of specific CpG nucleotides, but with an overall consistent change seen across a CpG island (e.g. hypomethylation within Mnt and Notch1 promoters and hypermethylation within the Ell2 promoter), a phenomenon remarkably similar to what is observed in individual human primary tumors (29, 30).  Several of the gene expression changes that we observed were similar to what is seen in other tumors. Sox4 is overexpressed in endometrial tumors due to hypermethylation of miR-129-2, which normally suppresses SOX4 (35). Notch1, although not altered by DNA methylation in human tumors, is overexpressed in hypomethylated thymic tumors that develop in Dnmt1 hypomorphic mice (36). Additionally, Mnt forms heterodimers with Myc that lead to transcriptional repression of some genes in many cancers (37). Examining the effects of DNMT3B7 within other tumor models will test whether these DNMT3B7-induced effects are specific to Myc itself (38), or are common to tumors that form under the direction of other oncogenes.  The co-expression of a truncated DNMT-like protein along with the full-length enzymes, as we have modeled for cancer cells, is a well-established paradigm in other systems. DNMT3L, a protein highly homologous to the DNMTs, is known to bind to the intact DNMT3A and DNMT3B enzymes and regulate their function (39–41). Therefore, the interaction of DNMT3B7 with DNMT3B suggests that DNMT3B7 influences the activity of intact DNMT3B.  Aberrant DNMT3B transcription is one example of a widespread phenomenon of alternative splicing seen in human tumors (6). Investigation of splicing signatures in ovarian and breast tumors showed that they are characteristic for tumors and can be used to distinguish normal tissues from cancer (42, 43). DNMT3B was among the few genes that could be used to distinguish normal tissue from ovarian or breast tumors, providing further evidence that aberrant DNMT3B transcription is a common and defining event in tumorigenesis.  Our results show that DNMT3B7, a truncated DNMT3B isoform found in tumors, disrupts murine embryonic development and accelerates lymphomagenesis with dramatic changes in DNA methylation patterns. This system represents the first in vivo model for the redistribution of DNA methylation seen in human tumors and argues that the presence of truncated DNMT3B proteins within human tumors play an important role in the observed changes in DNA methylation that characterize virtually all human tumors.  The drivers of abnormal DNA methylation in human cancers include widespread aberrant splicing of the DNMT3B gene, producing abnormal transcripts that encode truncated proteins that may act as dominant negative isoforms. To test whether reduced Dnmt3b dosage can alter tumorigenesis, we bred Dnmt3b+/− mice to Eµ-Myc mice, a mouse model susceptible to B-cell lymphomas. Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− mice showed a dramatic acceleration of lymphomagenesis, greater even than that observed in Eµ-Myc mice that express a truncated DNMT3B isoform found in human tumors, DNMT3B7. This finding indicates that Dnmt3b can act as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene. Although reduction in both Dnmt3b dosage and expression of DNMT3B7 within the Eµ-Myc system had similar effects on tumorigenesis and DNA hypermethylation, different molecular mechanisms appear to underlie these changes. This study offers insight into how de novo DNA methyltransferases function as tumor suppressors and the sensitivity of Myc-induced lymphomas to DNA methylation.  Go to: Introduction Cancer cells are characterized by abnormal DNA methylation, causing aberrant activation of some genes and silencing of others.1 Three DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) catalyze DNA methylation in eukaryotic cells DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B.2 Our laboratory and others discovered aberrant splicing of the DNMT3B gene in human cancer cells that produces transcripts encoding truncated proteins that may act as dominant negative isoforms.3,4 Transgenic mice expressing DNMT3B7, an aberrant transcript expressed most commonly in human cancers, have little cancer predisposition on their own.5 However, when crossed to Eµ-Myc mice, which are susceptible to B-cell lymphomas,6 Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice showed accelerated mediastinal tumorigenesis, with overall increases in global DNA methylation and alterations in site-specific DNA methylation.5  DNMT3B7 transgenic mice demonstrated developmental defects including subaortic ventriculoseptal defects,5 reminiscent of those in Dnmt3b knockout mice.7,8 Given the similar phenotype between DNMT3B7 transgenic mice and Dnmt3b knockout mice, we hypothesized that DNMT3B7 acts as a dominant negative isoform of full-length Dnmt3b. Recent work has demonstrated that inactive DNMT3B isoforms can alter the enzymatic activity of full-length DNMT3B in vitro.9 Because we observed acceleration of tumorigenesis in Eµ-Myc mice with DNMT3B7 introduction, we tested whether Dnmt3b gene dosage (Dnmt3b+/−) could influence Myc-induced lymphomagenesis.  Go to: Study design Mice and monitoring of tumors  Dnmt3b+/− knockout mice7 and Eµ-Myc mice,6 both on a pure C57Bl/6 background, were interbred, and at least 20 mice of each Dnmt3b genotype carrying the Eµ-Myc transgene were monitored for lymphoma development.5  Chromatin immunoprecipitation  Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using a Myc (Millipore, Billerica, MA) or Dnmt3b antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers are listed in supplemental Table 1.  Detailed materials and methods are included in “Supplemental Materials.”  Go to: Results and Discussion Given the acceleration of Myc-induced lymphomagenesis in the presence of the dominant-negative DNMT3B7 protein,5 we tested directly whether reducing Dnmt3b levels would influence tumorigenesis in Eµ-Myc mice.6 We found dramatic acceleration in mediastinal lymphomagenesis in Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− mice (Figure 1A), whereas the incidence of peripheral lymphomas was not significantly different (supplemental Figure 1A). Overall lymphoma incidence was dramatically accelerated in both Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 and Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− mice (supplemental Figure 1B). Similar to the Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 mice, mediastinal tumors isolated from Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− mice were composed of pre-B or mature B-lymphocytes (supplemental Figure 2), and the mice had high leukocyte counts (supplemental Table S2). Cell lines generated from mediastinal tumors recapitulated the enhanced growth (Figure 1B). Cell-cycle profile analysis demonstrated that the growth difference arose from Eµ-Myc cells accumulating in the S-phase, and Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 and Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− cells overcoming this block in progression from S to G2 phase (supplemental Figure 3). There were no significant differences in apoptosis in the 3 cell lines (data not shown). The Dnmt3b cDNA expressed from the remaining allele was wild-type in sequence (data not shown), establishing that Dnmt3b has a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor function in the Eµ-Myc mouse model.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Incidence of mediastinal lymphomas and changes in DNA methylation in Eμ-Myc, Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7, and Eμ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− mice. (A) Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− (dotted line) vs Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 (dashed line) and Eµ-Myc ... Our observation is consistent with recent work demonstrating that complete ablation of Dnmt3b in T-lymphocytes promotes proliferation and accelerates lymphomagenesis in the context of MYC overexpression.11 Conditional deletion of Dnmt3a in a mouse model of lung tumorigenesis also promotes tumor growth and progression.12 Heterozygous DNMT3A mutations, often in exons encoding the catalytic domain, have been found in myeloid neoplasms.13-15 Taken together, these data suggest that the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B function as haploinsufficient tumor suppressors.  We found a progressive increase in the global 5-methylcytosine levels in Eµ-Myc, Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7, and Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− tumors (Figure 1C).5 Because Dnmt3b+/− transgenic mice themselves do not demonstrate any overt DNA methylation defect,7 this was an unexpected observation. A CpG island hypermethylation signature was defined in a mouse model of MYC-induced lymphomas,16 supporting the hypothesis that MYC drives DNA methylation. DNA methylation levels in B1 repetitive elements, major and minor satellites, and retroviruses were similar across all Eµ-Myc genotypes (data not shown). The expression of Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3l did not differ significantly between the Eµ-Myc, Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7, and Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− cell lines; however, almost all Dnmts increased in expression with Myc overexpression (Figure 1D-G). In a proliferative germinal center B-cell model, repatterning of DNA methylation correlated with gene expression changes and upregulation of DNMT1 expression.17 Chromosomal abnormalities in Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− tumors were not significantly different compared with Eµ-Myc tumors (supplemental Table 3).  Because virtually all human tumors and cell lines express aberrant DNMT3B transcripts, we focused on testing whether the molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis in Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 and Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− tumors was similar. We hypothesized that Myc, Dnmt3b, and DNMT3B7 could form a complex when DNMT3B7 was expressed, because Myc binds to Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b,18 and DNMT3B7 binds to full-length Dnmt3b.5 We hypothesized that this complex could bind at Myc-binding E-box(es) upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS), leading to hypermethylation and gene repression. Because Myc binds preferentially at hypomethylated E-boxes,19 we predicted hypomethylation around the E-box of the Myc target gene tested.  To test this hypothesis, we examined DNA methylation in promoters of genes that are known Myc targets and are repressed in Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 tumors (see “Supplemental Methods”). Mycbp, which encodes a protein that binds c-Myc and enhances its ability to activate transcription, was hypomethylated around the E-box in both Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 and Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− tumors relative to Eµ-Myc tumors (Figure 2A). We observed more heterogeneity in DNA methylation levels of particular CpG dinucleotides in Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 tumors relative to the Eµ-Myc tumors as we had observed previously,5 in contrast to Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− tumors that failed to demonstrate this heterogeneity (Figure 2A). The Mycbp TSS was hypermethylated in Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 tumors relative to Eµ-Myc tumors, a feature not shared by Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− tumors (Figure 2B).  Figure 2 Figure 2 DNA methylation changes and binding of Myc and Dnmt3b at Mycbp promoter elements. (A) DNA methylation changes measured by bisulfite sequencing around the E-box upstream of Mycbp TSS. Schematic diagram for Mycbp is shown with exons represented by vertical ... A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay around the E-box demonstrated enrichment of Myc binding in the Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 cell lines and absence of Myc binding in both Eµ-Myc and Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− cell lines (Figure 2C). We also found Dnmt3b enrichment at the Mycbp TSS in Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 cell lines, a phenomenon not observed in Eµ-Myc and Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− cell lines (Figure 2D). Consistent with DNA methylation patterns around the TSS, there was Mycbp repression in Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 tumors, but not in Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− tumors (Figure 2E). We also observed enrichment of Myc binding at the Mycbp TSS and increased enrichment of Dnmt3b binding at the Mycbp E-box (supplemental Figure 4). Similar results were seen for Gadd45a and Maf, which are other Myc targets (supplemental Figures 5A and 6). Gadd45a repression in Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 and Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− tumors (supplemental Figure 5B) provides a mechanism for the hypermethylation observed in these tumors. Taken together, our data indicate that Eµ-Myc/DNMT3B7 tumors have increased Myc binding at the Mycbp E-box, which enhances recruitment of Dnmt3b to form a repressive complex at its promoter, leading to Mycbp repression (Figure 2F), a mechanism distinct from that present in Eµ-Myc/Dnmt3b+/− tumors.  Overall, our observations suggest that Myc-induced lymphomas are exquisitely sensitive to DNA methylation, which may suggest that targeting epigenetic pathways may be particularly effective for MYC-induced hematopoietic malignancies. Epigenetic silencing of RASSF1A, a tumor suppressor gene, has been shown to occur via HOXB3-mediated induction of DNMT3B, which binds MYC and polycomb repressor at the RASSF1A promoter in multiple human cancer cell lines.20 The ability of JQ1, an inhibitor of BRD4-mediated reading of the histone code, to suppress myeloid leukemia cell growth further supports the importance of epigenetic therapy.21 Finally, our findings, combined with the identification of heterozygous DNMT3A mutations in myeloid malignancies, suggest that both de novo DNA methyltransferases can act as haploinsufficient tumor suppressors.  Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, have been shown to promote breast cancer progression. However, the mechanism by which cancer cells acquire and maintain abnormal DNA methylation is not well understood. We have previously identified an aberrant splice form of a DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3B7, expressed in virtually all cancer cell lines but at very low levels in normal cells. Furthermore, aggressive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells have been shown to express increased levels of DNMT3B7 compared to poorly invasive MCF-7 cells, indicating that DNMT3B7 may have a role in promoting a more invasive phenotype. Using data gathered from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we show that DNMT3B7 expression is increased in breast cancer patient tissues compared to normal tissue. To determine the mechanism by which DNMT3B7 was functioning in breast cancer cells, two poorly invasive breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and T-47D, were stably transfected with a DNMT3B7 expression construct. Expression of DNMT3B7 led to hypermethylation and down-regulation of E-cadherin, altered localization of β-catenin, as well as increased adhesion turnover, cell proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth. The novel results presented in this study suggest a role for DNMT3B7 in the progression of breast cancer to a more aggressive state and the potential for future development of novel therapeutics.  Go to: Introduction Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women in the United States, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers[1]. In 2013, more than 230,000 women in the United States were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and an additional 60,000 were diagnosed with in situ disease. Approximately 40,000 women died of breast cancer last year, second only to lung cancer. Five-year survival rates vary significantly depending on the level to which a tumor has progressed at the time of diagnosis. Today, cases of localized breast cancer have a 99% survival rate. However, that rate falls to 24% when the cancer has metastasized to distant organs[1]. These differences in survival rates highlight the importance of determining the mechanisms responsible for tumor progression to a more aggressive and metastatic phenotype.  Cancer cells are characterized by abnormal DNA methylation patterns compared to normal cells[2,3]. Specifically, there is often global hypomethylation as well as gene-specific changes in promoter methylation. Some normally hypomethylated and transcriptionally active genes become hypermethylated and transcriptionally silent. Conversely, genes that are normally hypermethylated may become hypomethylated and transcriptionally active. Unfortunately, the specific mechanism by which cancer cells acquire and maintain aberrant methylation is still unknown. Three DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes found in eukaryotic cells catalyze cytosine methylation: DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. DNMT1 is generally regarded as the main cellular maintenance methylase, whereas DNMT3A and DNMT3B are de novo methylases able to establish new methylation patterns at sites that have not been previously methylated[4–6]. Interestingly, many aberrant transcripts of DNMT3B are highly expressed in cancer cells[7,8]. One of the most common of these transcripts, DNMT3B7, contains 94 bp of intron 10 sequence leading to an early stop codon and the formation of a truncated protein. Ostler and colleagues demonstrated that DNMT3B7 is expressed in many different cancer cell types, including breast cancer[7]. Furthermore, expression of DNMT3B7 correlates with global changes in gene expression due to altered promoter methylation. Specifically, expression of DNMT3B7 in 293 cells led to hypermethylation of the promoter region of CDH1/E-cadherin[7]. Loss of CDH1 expression is a hallmark of tumor progression to a more aggressive state and may provide a mechanism by which DNMT3B7 functions in cancer cells[9–11]. Additional studies have described changes in cellular phenotypes as a result of aberrant expression of DNMT3B7[7,8,12]. Because of the clinical importance of breast cancer to women’s health, we studied the mechanism(s) by which DNMT3B7 alters cell phenotype specifically within breast tumor cells.  Go to: Materials and Methods TCGA analysis  Breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) RNAseqV2 and clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. Data were organized and processed using a custom Python script and Microsoft Excel (Redmond, Washington) to analyze expression of the retained 94bp sequence of intron 10 that is specific to DNMT3B7. Analyses were conducted on all available patient data. Clinical staging was measured as stage I (combination of stage I, stage IA, and stage IB), stage II (combination of stage II, stage IIA, and stage IIB), stage III (combination of stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC), or stage IV. Each molecular subtype was defined as follows from immunohistochemical analysis found in the BRCA clinical database: luminal A (ER positive and/or PR positive and HER2 negative), luminal B (ER positive and/or PR positive and HER2 positive), triple negative/basal like (ER negative, PR negative, and HER2 negative), and HER2 type (ER negative, PR negative, and HER2 positive).  Cells and culture conditions  MCF-7 and T-47D breast cancer cell lines were obtained from ATCC. All cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 in complete media containing RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), 10% FBS (Life Technologies) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Cells were stably transfected with 1 μg of HA-tagged DNMT3B7[7] or a vector-only control (Life Technologies) using Effectene per manufacturer protocols (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Transfected cells were selected with G418 (Life Technologies) for 3 weeks. DNMT3B7 expression was verified by immunoblot analysis and only cell lines that showed expression levels comparable to those seen in MDA-MB-231 cells were utilized for further experimentation. All cells were harvested at ~80% confluence.  Electrophoresis and immunoblotting  Whole cell lysate collection and immunoblotting were performed as previously described[13]. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were collected as previously described[7]. All lysates contained protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitor (PhoSTOP, Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Blots were incubated with E-cadherin (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), DNMT3B T-16 (1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), topoisomerase (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or actin (1:5000, Millipore, Temecula, CA) and incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody (1:2000, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Protein was visualized using chemiluminescent spray (Denville, South Plainfield, NJ) and imaged using a FOTO/Analyst Luminary FX system (Fotodyne, Hartland, WI).  Sodium bisulfite treatment and methylation-specific PCR  Genomic DNA was isolated (Promega, Madison, WI) and bisulfite treated according to manufacturer protocols (CpGenome, Millipore). Methylation-specific primers to the promoter region of E-cadherin were developed using the MethPrimer freeware[14], forward primer: 5-GAATTGTAAAGTATTTGTGAGTTTG-3’ and reverse primer: 5’-AATACCTACAACAACAACAACAAC-3’. The 168 bp PCR product contained 15 CpGs and included the start AUG. PCR products were purified (Promega) and sequenced (ACGT, Inc., Wheeling, IL). Relative size of methylated C:T peaks was measured to determine methylation at each CpG.  Immunofluorescence  Cells were plated on glass coverslips and immunofluorescence was performed as previously described[15] using a 1:50 dilution of β-catenin antibody (pSer675, Cell Signaling) and 1:500 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Life Technologies) and imaged using a Leica DM4000 microscope and DFC360 FX Camera with AF6000 software (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL).  In vitro cell adhesion assay  To measure cell adhesion, 5×104 cells were plated in a 6-well dish and allowed to adhere for 1 hour. Cells were subsequently washed with PBS and counted to determine adhesive ability.  In vitro cell proliferation assay  Cells were plated in a 6-well dish at a density of 1×106 cells/well. All cells were counted and re-plated at the same density (1×106 cells/well) twice a week for 3 weeks in order to avoid over-growth on the dish. The total number of cells was calculated by adding each subsequent count to the previous measurement.  Soft agar assays  Soft agar assays were performed as previously described to measure anchorage-independent growth[16].  Statistical analysis  Pairwise statistical significance was determined by a Student’s T-Test while comparisons among groups was analyzed with a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons using SigmaStat software (Systat, Chicago, IL). For immunoblots, densitometry was performed to determine relative expression levels using Photoshop (Adobe). Each blot was repeated three times and densities of individual bands were analyzed, normalized to the corresponding loading control, and finally normalized to control cells (set at 1.0). All experiments were performed in triplicate.  Go to: Results DNMT3B7 expression is elevated in breast tumor tissues at an early clinical stage  Previous work has demonstrated that DNMT3B7 is highly expressed in cancer cell lines compared to normal cells[7]. To examine DNMT3B7 expression within human tissue samples, we utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and found that in over 1000 available tissue samples DNMT3B7 expression was elevated in breast cancer samples compared to normal tissues (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, when 103 matched normal and tumor samples were analyzed, we observed the same increase in DNMT3B7 expression, indicating that this change in expression is due to tumor progression itself and not differences within individual patient genetics (Fig. 1B). Additionally, when breast cancer patients were grouped by clinical stage, we observed that DNMT3B7 expression increases between stage I and II, and then remains consistently high in later stages, demonstrating the aberrant transcript correlates with tumor progression to a more advanced stage (Fig. 1C). Finally, using immunohistochemical data from the TCGA, we were able to separate the breast cancer patients into one of four molecular subtypes—luminal A (ER positive and/or PR positive and HER2 negative), luminal B (ER positive and/or PR positive and HER2 positive), triple negative/basal-like (ER negative, PR negative, and HER2 negative), and HER2 type (ER negative, PR negative, and HER2 positive). It is well documented that triple negative and HER2 positive patients have a more aggressive disease phenotype that grows and spreads faster than other breast cancer subtypes[1]. Our results show an increase in DNMT3B7 expression in triple negative and HER2 patients compared to luminal A and B groups (Fig. 1D), indicating that DNMT3B7 expression correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients.  Figure 1 Figure 1 DNMT3B7 expression in breast cancer. Expression of DNMT3B7 in poorly invasive breast cancer cells promotes hypermethylation and down-regulation of E-cadherin  The clinical studies described above correlated with previous data showing increased expression of DNMT3B7 at both the gene and protein level in the highly invasive/metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, compared to the poorly invasive MCF-7 cell line, two cell lines representing the opposite extremes of breast cancer progression[7](data not shown). Although these data indicate a potential role for DNMT3B7 in tumor progression, the exact mechanism by which it functions is unclear. To that end, we stably transfected DNMT3B7 into two poorly invasive breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and T-47D, to determine the role of DNMT3B7 in breast cancer progression (Fig. 1E-F). Previous studies have shown that expression of DNMT3B7 in fibroblasts led to changes in cytosine modifications of CDH1[7], a well-known hallmark of tumor progression[9–11]. Therefore, we used bisulfite sequencing, an indirect measure of DNA methylation, to examine cytosine modifications of the CDH1 promoter in our stably-transfected cell lines. We observed hypermethylation of a CpG island within the promoter region of CDH1 in our MCF-7 (Fig. 2A) and T-47D (Fig. 2B) cell lines expressing DNMT3B7. It is important to note that there are variations in the level of hypermethylation between cell lines due to heterogeneity within the population. The CpG island included the translation start site (TSS) of CDH1 indicating the potential for down-regulation at the protein level. Subsequent examination of E-cadherin protein expression in our cell lines via Western blot and densitometric quantification indicated a loss of E-cadherin expression in the presence of DNMT3B7 (Fig. 2C-F). Taken together, these data demonstrate that DNMT3B7 expression in breast cancer cell lines leads to hypermethylation and down-regulation of CDH1.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Hypermethylation and down-regulation of E-cadherin in the presence of DNMT3B7. β-catenin localization is altered in cells expressing DNMT3B7  It is well documented that a loss of E-cadherin expression can lead to altered localization of one of its binding partners, β-catenin, which correlates with poor clinical prognosis[17–22]. Under normal conditions with high levels of E-cadherin, β-catenin is expressed at the membrane to participate in cell adhesions. However, upon loss of E-cadherin expression, β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor to promote cell proliferation. Therefore, we examined the localization of β-catenin in our cells expressing DNMT3B7 and observed strong membrane staining in all of our cell lines (Fig. 3A-F). However, we also observed nuclear localization of β-catenin in 7% of MCF-7 and 10% of T-47D cells expressing DNMT3B7, which was not seen in control cells (Fig. 3G-H). This staining corresponded with the decrease in E-cadherin expression described above and may indicate a mechanism by which DNMT3B7 promotes tumor progression by changes in cell adhesion and proliferation in breast cancer cells.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Expression of DNMT3B7 alters β-catenin localization in breast cancer cells. DNMT3B7 expression promotes adhesion turnover, cell proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth in breast cancer cells  The ability of cells to create and subsequently break strong cell adhesions is a key factor in progression to a more motile and aggressive phenotype. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that β-catenin expression correlates with changes in cell adhesion and proliferation[23–25]. Because of the changes we observed in E-cadherin and β-catenin expression, we tested the ability of DNMT3B7 to alter cell adhesion formation and found increased adhesion turnover in cells expressing DNMT3B7 compared to controls (Fig. 4A and 4D). Cell proliferation was also measured as an indicator of tumor progression to a more aggressive phenotype. MCF-7 (Fig. 4B) and T-47D (Fig. 4E) cells stably expressing DNMT3B7 showed increased cell proliferation/growth over a 3-week period compared to controls indicating the progression to a more aggressive cancer phenotype. Finally, an important indicator of tumor progression is the ability of cancer cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. We observed increased colony growth in soft agar in MCF-7 (Fig. 4C) and T-47D (Fig. 4F) cells expressing DNMT3B7 compared to empty vector controls. Taken together, these data demonstrate that expression of DNMT3B7 promotes a more aggressive phenotype in breast cancer cells through changes in cell adhesion, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth.  Figure 4 Figure 4 DNMT3B7 regulates cell adhesion, proliferation, and growth in soft agar. Go to: Discussion It is imperative that we understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which tumors develop in order to aid in the development of novel therapeutics. To that end, the data presented here demonstrate that expression of a truncated DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3B7, is increased in breast cancer patient tissues compared to normal tissues and correlates to a worse clinical prognosis. In addition, we determined a molecular mechanism by which DNMT3B7 promotes tumor progression in breast cancer cells through hypermethylation and loss of CDH1/E-cadherin expression, altered β-catenin localization, and subsequent changes in cell adhesion, proliferation, and growth in soft agar (Fig. 5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Putative model of DNMT3B7 action in poorly invasive breast cancer cells. Interestingly, while most studies have demonstrated that DNMT3B7 promotes tumor progression in cancer cells[7,12], it has been shown to have the opposite effect in neuroblastoma cells[8]. Indeed, Ostler and colleagues showed that expression of DNMT3B7 in neuroblastoma led to decreased proliferation and tumor progression compared to controls. The E-cadherin results shown here lead to an interesting proposition that may explain the differing results seen in our work and this previous study. It is well documented that loss of E-cadherin expression is a hallmark of breast cancer progression and a potential sign of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)[26]. In breast cancer cells, cadherin switching between the normal E-cadherin expression and aberrant N-cadherin is an important indicator of tumor progression and prognosis[27]. However, in neuroblastoma cells, the opposite effect, a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, is a sign of tumor progression to a more aggressive state, concurrent with an up-regulation of E-cadherin and down-regulation of the normal N-cadherin. In both cases, DNMT3B7 expression is inversely correlated with E-cadherin expression and may provide a link to its mechanism of action in cancer cells. Further studies to examine cadherin switching in cells expressing DNMT3B7 and determine a potential role for the aberrant transcript in EMT are ongoing (Fig. 5).  The results described above indicate that inhibition of E-cadherin expression corresponds to the localization of β-catenin in the nucleus and subsequent changes in cell adhesion and proliferation. However, it is possible that other signaling pathways are altered due to the loss of E-cadherin expression which may have further consequences for these cells. Although we were able to show changes in β-catenin localization here, no studies have examined the expression or function of other catenins in cells expressing DNMT3B7. It is also possible that signals downstream of E-cadherin have been altered which could provide additional mechanisms by which aberrant DNMTs function in breast cancer cells. While changes to an E-cadherin mediated signaling pathway have been observed in breast cancer cell lines, it is not know at this time if these changes are regulated by DNMT3B7[28]. Future studies in our laboratory will examine the effects of aberrant DNMTs on various signaling pathways within breast cancer cells (Fig. 5).  Finally, although this study has focused on the role of DNMT3B7 in breast cancer cells, there are many other aberrant DNMT3B transcripts that are expressed in cancer cells[8]. It is imperative that we understand the role of each of these aberrant transcripts, functioning together and separately, in order to have a better understanding of how these transcripts contribute to transformed phenotypes. Taken together, the data presented here provide a novel mechanism by which DNMT3B7 functions in breast cancer cells to promote a more aggressive phenotype and may provide direction for novel therapeutics in the future.  Epigenetic changes in pediatric neuroblastoma may contribute to the aggressive pathophysiology of this disease, but little is known about the basis for such changes. In this study, we examined a role for the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, in particular, the truncated isoform DNMT3B7 which is generated frequently in cancer. To investigate if aberrant DNMT3B transcripts alter DNA methylation, gene expression, and phenotypic character in neuroblastoma, we measured DNMT3B expression in primary tumors. Higher levels of DNMT3B7 were detected in differentiated ganglioneuroblastomas compared to undifferentiated neuroblastomas, suggesting that expression of DNMT3B7 may induce a less aggressive clinical phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of enforced DNMT3B7 expression in neuroblastoma cells, finding a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. DNMT3B7-positive cells had higher levels of total genomic methylation and a dramatic decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN family members that comprise AP1 transcription factors. Consistent with an established antagonistic relationship between AP1 expression and retinoic acid receptor activity, increased differentiation was seen in the DNMT3B7-expressing neuroblastoma cells following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) compared to controls. Our results indicate that DNMT3B7 modifies the epigenome in neuroblastoma cells to induce changes in gene expression, inhibit tumor growth, and increase sensitivity to ATRA.  Keywords: DNMT3B, Neuroblastoma, DNA Methylation Go to: Introduction In adult cancers, epigenetic changes and aberrant splicing of DNMT3B are observed frequently (1, 2). Pediatric neuroblastoma is characterized by a range of clinical behaviors, and genetic and epigenetic aberrations contribute to pathogenesis (3-5). The Cohn laboratory and others have shown that hypermethylation and silencing of genes involved in the regulation of tumor growth, cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair are associated with aggressive growth and poor outcome in patients (6-8). Further, poor prognosis can be predicted by a CpG island methylator phenotype (9). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that neuroblastoma growth can be inhibited by drugs that disrupt DNA methylation (10, 11). Retinoic acid, a differentiation-inducing agent that has been shown to improve clinical outcome (12), can reverse the methylation status of hundreds of gene promoters (13), possibly due to decreased levels of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes (14).  Three DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes regulate DNA methylation in eukaryotic cells (15-17), with widespread aberrant DNMT3B transcription in cancer cells encoding truncated proteins lacking the catalytic domain (1, 2, 18-20). Forced expression of DNMT3B7 within 293 cells led to altered DNA methylation levels and corresponding gene expression changes, indicating that DNMT3B7 expression could alter DNA methylation levels and gene expression (18). DNMT3B7 transgenic mice exhibit altered embryonic development (21).  Despite advances in genome-wide profiling that demonstrate strong correlations between genetic aberrations and clinical phenotype, we know much less about the clinical significance of epigenetic changes in neuroblastoma. Given that aberrant DNMT3B isoforms are common in cancer cells, we hypothesized that aberrant DNMT3B transcripts found in neuroblastoma tumors could alter DNA methylation, gene expression, and tumor phenotype.  Go to: Materials and Methods Patients and tumor specimens  Two ganglioneuroblastoma, three ganglioneuroma, and thirteen primary neuroblastoma tumors were obtained from Children’s Memorial Hospital in Chicago under an IRB approved protocol. Twelve RNA samples derived from one ganglioneuroblastoma and eleven neuroblastomas were obtained from the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) Neuroblastoma Tumor Bank. The laboratory studies were approved by The University of Chicago Institutional Review Board.  Cell culture, cell identification, and nucleic acid isolation  Cell line identities were verified by short tandem repeat profiling using the AmpF/STR Identifiler PCR Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). RNA and DNA isolation was performed using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and Puregene Core kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), respectively.  The MSCV-I-GFP plasmid backbone was engineered to confer constitutive DNMT3B7 expression using a 5’ EcoRI site, C-terminal His-tag epitope, and 3’ XhoI site using primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. Retroviral constructs and packaging plasmid psi-Eco were used to produce retroviral supernatants by 293T cell co-transfection using Fugene6 Transfection Reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The inducible DNMT3B7 construct was generated using oligonucleotides listed in Supplementary Table S1 to ligate into the pRetroX-Tight–Pur response vector (pRXTPL) (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The Tet-Off System (Clontech) was used to produce inducible LA1-55n cell lines. In the presence of doxycycline, there is no induction of gene expression in either the control or DNMT3B7-containing cell line. In the absence of doxycycline, the DNMT3B7-containing cells express both GFP and DNMT3B7, and the vector control cells express only GFP. We have compared the vector cells expressing GFP to the experimental cells expressing GFP and DNMT3B7 to control for any effects of GFP expression.  All plasmid inserts were sequenced to ensure proper correct sequence.  Neuroblastoma xenograft studies  Four- to six-week-old female homozygous athymic nude mice (Harlan, Madison, WI) were inoculated subcutaneously into the right flank with DNMT3B7-expressing cells (or control) and measured twice weekly (see Supplementary Material and Methods for details). Tumor volumes were measured twice weekly and calculated using the following formula: tumor volume = (length × width2)/ 2. Mice bearing SMS-KCNR (constitutive expression) xenografts were sacrificed after 28 days. Mice bearing LA1-55n (inducible expression) xenografts were divided randomly into two groups when palpable tumors developed; control mice continued receiving doxycycline-containing water to block DNMT3B7 expression, and animals in the experimental group were given normal drinking water to induce DNMT3B7 expression. Mice in both groups were sacrificed after 35 days.  Immunohistochemical analysis  Immunohistochemistry was performed for CD-31 (1:100, M-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to determine the mean vascular density, and Ki-67 (1:200, MIB-1, DakoCytomation) to assess proliferation rate (10).  Quantification of apoptosis  In situ detection of apoptosis was performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN) (22).  Liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC/MS)  Total cytosine methylation was performed by LC/MS, as described previously (21).  Sodium bisulfite treatment, PCR amplification, and protein expression analysis  Genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite (23), and PCR amplifications were performed using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1 using ZymoTaq (ZymoResearch) at the indicated temperatures. Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript III (Invitrogen), and PCR amplifications were performed using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) using primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. Whole cell extracts were made by lysing cells in 75mM NaCl, 25mM Tris-Cl, and 1:100 protease inhibitors (CalBiochem). DNMT3B was detected with T-16 antibody (1:500, sc-10236, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and TOP1 was used as a loading control (1:400 dilution ab3825 AbCam).  RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq)  Total RNAs were isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA integrity was validated using the Agilent BioAnalyzer, and all samples had an RNA integrity number >9. Libraries were generated following the Illumina protocol for Preparing Samples for Sequencing of mRNA. PCR amplified cDNA libraries were quantified on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Single-end sequencing was performed for 36-cycles using Single Read Cluster Generation Kit V4 (Cat# GD-103-4001) and Sequencing Kits (Cat# FC-104-4002). Sequence reads from the RNA-sequencing were aligned to genomic sequence (Human Feb. 2009 assembly, GRCh37/hg19). RNA-Sequencing data have been submitted to the GEO database, record number GSE36350.  Statistical analyses  Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Student’s t test or Fisher’ Exact Test. A P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For the RNA Sequencing data, each DNMT3B7-expressing cell line was compared to the vector control and Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing using n=18,674, the total number of genes that had at least one read in all three cell lines. Analysis of ATRA treatment of DNMT3B7-expressing or control cells was done using the mixed effect restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analysis model.  Go to: Results Aberrant DNMT3B transcripts are expressed in primary neuroblastoma tumors  To investigate significance of aberrant DNMT3B transcripts in neuroblastoma, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was performed on a hypothesis-generating cohort of three ganglioneuroblastoma, three ganglioneuromas, and 24 primary neuroblastoma samples using primers that amplified all but two of the known alternative and aberrant DNMT3B isoforms (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. S1A, Table 1). Additional DNMT3B transcripts were detected by Southern Blot using a DNMT3B probe that hybridizes to all of the known aberrant isoforms amplified in the RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1B, C). We stratified the patients into two risk groups: high risk and non-high risk. Non-high risk patients included those with stages 1 and 2 disease, infants with stages 4 and 4S tumors, and patients with stage 3 tumors that lacked MYCN amplification. Similar to the criteria used by the COG, patients with stage 3 MYCN-amplified tumors and children older than 1 year of age with stage 4 disease were considered high risk (4). We found the expression of four or more aberrant DNMT3B isoforms correlated with higher risk groups (P=0.03). The identity of DNMT3B7 was confirmed by sequencing in four primary tumors (data not shown), and expression of DNMT3B7 was quantified in the primary tumors by real-time RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We obtained ten more ganglioneuroblastoma RNAs from the COG. However, the integrity of the RNA was too low to determine the levels of DNMT3B isoforms (data not shown). We therefore hypothesized that high levels of DNMT3B7 may contribute to the more benign clinical behavior of the most differentiated tumors.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Aberrant DNMT3B expression and global DNA methylation in primary neuroblastoma tumors Table 1 Table 1 DNMT3B transcripts expressed in primary ganglioneuroma, ganglioneuroblastoma and neuroblastoma tumors. Neuroblastoma cell lines showed expression patterns of DNMT3B transcripts similar to that of the primary tumors by RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). Tumorigenic N-type cells (24) had an increased number of DNMT3B transcripts and lacked DNMT3B7. By Western blot, we found the N-type cells have only full-length DNMT3B, whereas non-tumorigenic S-type cells had both full-length DNMT3B and the truncated DNMT3B7 (Fig. 1C).  Forced expression of DNMT3B7 in neuroblastoma cells inhibits growth  Because we detected high levels of DNMT3B7 in differentiated tumors associated with more favorable outcomes, we hypothesized that DNMT3B7 could modify neuroblastoma phenotype. We introduced DNMT3B7 into an N-type neuroblastoma cell line (LA1-55n) using a Tet-off inducible system. Repression of cell growth in the DNMT3B7-expressing cell lines was seen after ten days of induction (P<0.001) (Fig. 2A). The expression of DNMT3B7 was evaluated by Western blot analysis at each time point (Fig. 2B). DNMT3B7 expression was low during the first week and increased as the growth of the cells decreased. The level of DNMT3B7-expression in the induced cells was two-fold higher than what was found in ganglioneuroblastoma tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Similar results were obtained using constitutive expression of DNMT3B7 in another N-type neuroblastoma cell line, SMS-KCNR (Supplementary Fig. S3).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Establishment of neuroblastoma cells overexpressed DNMT3B7 Both the inducible DNMT3B7-LA1-55n cells and constitutively-expressing DNMT3B7-SMS-KCNR cells were used to test the effects of DNMT3B7 expression on tumor growth in murine xenograft models using LA1-55n cells (Fig. 3A) and SMS-KCNR cells (Fig. 3C). In both models, expression of DNMT3B7 inhibited tumor growth (Fig. 3A, C). Tumor vascularity, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were evaluated in both the LA1-55n (Fig. 3B) and SMS-KCNR (Fig. 3D) xenografts with and without forced DNMT3B7 expression. Histologic sections were stained with CD31 and showed fewer endothelial cells in the DNMT3B7-expressing tumors (Fig. 3B iv, 3D iv) compared to control tumors (Fig. 3B iii, 3D iii). Significantly lower mean vascular density (35.2 ± 8.3 vs 72.2 ± 9.5; P<0.001) was detected in xenografts with expression of DNMT3B7 (Supplementary Fig. S4A). In addition, blood vessels in the DNMT3B7-positive tumors were thin-walled and structurally more normal (Fig. 3B ii, 3D ii) than in the control tumors (Fig. 3B i, 3D i).  Figure 3 Figure 3 In vivo xenograft assays Cell proliferation in the DNMT3B7-positive xenografts was evaluated by Ki-67 expression, a nuclear protein that is preferentially expressed during active phases of the cell cycle. Ki-67 negative cells, representing quiescent G0 phase cells, are more abundant in the DNMT3B7-expressing tumors (Fig. 3B vi, 3D vi) than in control tumors (Fig. 3B v, 3D v). Significantly higher numbers of neuroblasts in G0 were detected in SMS-KCNR tumors with DNMT3B7 expression, compared to control tumors (39.2 ± 3.5 vs. 14.4 ± 1.9, respectively: P<0.001) (Supplementary Fig. S4B). TUNEL assays demonstrated that 2.5-fold more apoptotic cells were present in the DNMT3B7-positive xenografts compared to controls (P<0.01; Supplementary Fig. S4C). Overall, these results show that expression of DNMT3B7 in two neuroblastoma xenograft mouse models leads to tumors with a less aggressive phenotype.  DNMT3B7 expression cells have higher levels of global DNA methylation  We have shown previously that DNMT3B7 expression in an Eμ-Myc transgenic mouse model resulted in an increase in global DNA methylation (21). To determine if the expression of DNMT3B7 in the LA1-55n cells also increases DNA methylation, we measured global DNA methylation levels. As shown in Figure 4A, significantly higher levels of DNA methylation were detected in the LA1-55n expressing DNMT3B7 as compared to vector control cells. We found the methylation of Satellite 2 repetitive elements to have more DNA methylation following DNMT3B7-expression in the LA1-55n cells (Supplementary Fig S5). The increase in DNA methylation was also seen in both DNMT3B7-expressing xenografts. A statistically significant increase in total 5-methylcytosine levels was seen in the DNMT3B7-expressing tumors compared to controls (P<0.01, Fig. 4B), indicating that the pattern of DNA methylation is modified in the presence of the truncated DNMT3B7. Because we identified high levels of DNMT3B7 in ganglioneuroblastomas, we hypothesized that this would correlate with global DNA methylation levels. We found no difference between low, intermediate, and high risk groups. However, there was a statistically significant increase in global DNA methylation in the three ganglioneuroblastoma tumors (28, 65-1 and 2235) two of which have the highest level of DNMT3B7 expression seen in any primary tumor (Fig. 4C).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Global DNA Methylation by LC/MS DNMT3B7 expression induces changes in gene expression and DNA methylation  To investigate the effects of DNMT3B7 on gene expression, we used RNA-Sequencing to compare the gene expression profiles of two independent DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cells to vector control cells after 21 days of induction. After eliminating the genes with fewer than 150 reads per cell and those that had less than a three-fold change in either of the two DNMT3B7-expressing cell lines compared to the vector control, there were 144 genes that had at least an average five-fold change in the two DNMT3B7-expressing cell lines compared to the vector control cells (Supplementary Table S2). RNA-Sequencing confirmed the expression of DNMT3B7 only in the transduced cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). Similar to the expression of DNMT3B7 in Eμ-Myc transgenic mice (21), we found the expression of DNMT1, DNMT3A and endogenous DNMT3B was unchanged in the induced cells according to RNA-sequencing and real-time RT-PCR identified subtle increases in DNMT3A and DNMT3B (Supplementary Fig S7A-C). Among 117 genes with increased expression in the two DNMT3B7-expressing lines, 86 (73.5%) genes contained a CpG island, and 22 of the 27 (81.5%) of the genes with decreased expression contained a CpG island. Interestingly, eight of the 27 (29.6%) genes with decreased expression are found on chromosome 19 (P=0.0068), and seven (25.9%) are on chromosome 19p (P<0.0001). Copy number loss of chromosome 19 has been reported in 12.5% of neuroblastoma tumors (25, 26). No other chromosomal clustering of genes altered by DNMT3B7-expression was detected.  To identify genes that could contribute to the suppression of neuroblastoma cell growth in the presence of DNMT3B7, we focused on genes with the greatest fold changes by RNA-Sequencing that had CpG islands: ANKRD12 (22-fold), ASPM (15-fold), and EEA1 (14-fold) (increased expression); and FOSB (46-fold), ARC (21-fold), EGR1 (18-fold), and FOS (11-fold) (decreased expression). In addition, we performed a GeneGo pathway analysis of all of the genes with at least a five-fold average change in expression with at least 150 reads per cell (Supplementary Table S2), which identified an additional five genes of interest: three genes that encode members of the AP1 complex which were under-expressed in the DNMT3B7-expressing cell lines: FOSB (45-fold), FOS (11-fold) both identified above, and JUNB (six-fold); genes important in neuronal function and tumorigenesis: KIF20B (11-fold), ROCK1 (six-fold), and APC (five-fold); and RXRB (six-fold), encoding a retinoic acid signaling co-regulator that heterodimerizes with retinoic acid receptors (RARs) to bind on target gene promoters at the retinoic acid response element (RARE), important for retinoic acid treatment of children with high-risk neuroblastoma (12). In total, we performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR of all twelve genes of interest (Fig. 5A, B).  Figure 5 Figure 5 RNA-Sequencing Validation and CpG Island Methylation To test if the differential expression of genes in the DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cells was the result of an alteration in their DNA methylation patterns, we performed bisulfite sequencing of eight genes that had been validated by real-time RT-PCR. Six of these genes showed no detectable DNA methylation across the transcriptional start site. RXRB, a gene important in retinoic acid signaling, showed a decrease expression of two-fold in DNMT3B7-expressing cells by real-time RT-PCR, and the CpG island surrounding the transcriptional start site was hypermethylated in the presence of DNMT3B7 (Fig. 5C). Similarly, EEA1 expression was nine-fold higher by real-time RT-PCR, and the CpG island upstream of the transcriptional start site became completely hypomethylated in DNMT3B7-expressing cells (Fig. 5D). The changes in DNA methylation were validated by LC/MS (Supplementary Fig. S8). These data show that expression of DNMT3B7 in neuroblastoma cells leads changes in gene expression, some of which are correlated to altered CpG island methylation.  The effects of ATRA and DNMT3B7 expression on growth inhibition are additive  RNA-Sequencing of the DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cells revealed decreased expression of genes encoding components of the AP1 complex, FOSB (45-fold), FOS (11-fold), and JUNB (six-fold). In addition to acting as a transcription factor, AP1 can also antagonize the activity of retinoic acid receptors (27). We therefore hypothesized that, with reduced levels of AP1, retinoic acid receptors would be more active and could drive DNMT3B7-expressing cells toward differentiation. To test if retinoic acid treatment could augment the ability of DNMT3B7 to induce differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, we induced DNMT3B7 expression in the LA1-55n cells for two weeks to maximize DNMT3B7 expression (Fig. 2B). After two weeks of induction, both DNMT3B7-expressing cells and control cells were treated either with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or vehicle for seven days. We found that the effects of ATRA treatment and DNMT3B7 expression on growth inhibition were additive (Fig. 6A), not synergistic.  Figure 6 Figure 6 The effects of ATRA and DNMT3B7 expression on growth inhibition are additive To test if DNMT3B7-expressing cells were more differentiated than control cells, we studied the expression of 22 known neuroblastoma differentiation markers (28-33) and found that 18 of them had expression changes that correlated with a more differentiated phenotype (Supplementary Table S3). We validated the two genes with the greatest fold changes: GFRA1 and DLK1. GFRA1 encodes GDNF family receptor alpha 1 and has been shown to enhance differentiation in response to GDNF (34). GFRA1 expression was two-fold higher in two independent DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cell lines, compared to vector control (Fig. 6B left, dark gray bars). After ATRA treatment, GFRA1 expression was further increased in all cell lines (Fig. 6B left, light gray bars), and this increase was greater in the DNMT3B7-expressing cells. DLK1 encodes delta-like 1 homolog (Drosophila) and has been identified as a stem cell gene that negatively regulates differentiation (35). The expression of DLK1 in DNMT3B7-expressing cells was decreased up to two-fold in two independent DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cell lines (Fig. 6B right, dark gray bars). After ATRA treatment, DLK1 expression was further decreased in all cell lines (Fig. 6B left, light gray bars), and the expression in the DNMT3B7-expressing cells was significantly lower than in the vector control cells. Taken together, these results suggest a model in which the expression of DNMT3B7 induces neuroblastoma cells to differentiate, which can be promoted further by additional treatment by ATRA.  Go to: Discussion DNMT3B catalyzes de novo methylation of DNA sequences, and high levels of this enzyme have been detected in cancer (36). In addition to full-length DNMT3B, more than 40 transcripts have been detected in common adult malignant tumors (18, 37). Many of the encoded proteins lack either the DNA binding or catalytic domains, and some have been shown to modify the pattern of DNA methylation and gene expression (18, 20). In this study, we found DNMT3B7 transcripts in all of the ganglioneuromas tested and at very high levels in all of the ganglioneuroblastomas, leading us to the hypothesis that DNMT3B7 could induce differentiation and lead to a more benign phenotype, thereby modifying tumor phenotype in pediatric neuroblastoma.  To test this hypothesis, we forced DNMT3B7 expression in neuroblastoma cells using retroviral vectors to drive either constitutive or inducible expression and evaluated its effects on DNA methylation, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. We observed growth inhibition of aggressive neuroblastoma cell lines and xenograft tumors with slowed tumor growth and suppression of angiogenesis. Although aberrant hypermethylation of specific tumor suppressor genes and a CpG-methylator phenotype have been associated with clinically aggressive neuroblastomas (37), cancer cells are globally hypomethylated compared to normal cells. Thus, the increase in global DNA methylation observed in neuroblastoma cells with forced DNMT3B7 expression and decreased tumor growth are consistent with a non-malignant phenotype.  Previously, we have demonstrated altered DNA methylation and gene expression in 293 cells overexpressing DNMT3B7 (18). In addition, a re-distribution of DNA methylation was observed in DNMT3B7 transgenic mice (21). Forced expression of other DNMT3B isoforms containing the catalytic domain (ΔDNMT3B1-4) have been shown to induce hypermethylation of repetitive elements (38). The truncated DNMT3B variants that lack DNA binding or catalytic domains are likely to have altered function compared with DNMT3B, and may actually stimulate the activity of other DNMTs with which it heterodimerizes (39), leading to hypermethylation.  GeneGo pathway analysis of the RNA-Sequencing data of the DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cells identified several genes that may be important in neuroblastoma pathogenesis: KIF20B, ROCK1, ROCK2, APC and genes encoding members of the AP1 complex: FOSB, FOS, and JUNB. Increased expression of KIF1A has been found to correlate with high-risk neuroblastoma tumors (40). ROCK1 (six-fold) and ROCK2 (six-fold) were both under-expressed in DNMT3B7-expressing cells, and activated RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK have been shown to be negative regulators of growth cone motility (41). Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a tumor suppressor gene, highly expressed in the developing and adult nervous system, which is involved in neurite formation (42, 43), and apoptosis of neural crest cells (44).  Additionally, GeneGo pathway analysis of the RNA-Sequencing data revealed decreased expression of genes encoding the components of the AP1 complex, which can antagonize the activity of retinoic acid receptors through protein-protein interaction without requiring DNA binding (27). We therefore hypothesized that, with reduced levels of AP1, retinoic acid receptors would be more active in the DNMT3B7-expressing cells, allowing augmentation of differentiation by retinoid treatment. Indicative of increased differentiation, DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cells had higher expression of GFRA1 compared to vector controls following ATRA treatment. Similarly, the expression of DLK1 was decreased in both DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cell lines following ATRA treatment (Fig. 6B). It has been shown previously that ATRA treatment of another MYCN amplified neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-BE) leads to promoter hypomethylation (14), although we did not observe any significant global changes in DNA methylation after ATRA treatment (Supplementary Fig. S9). In the future, screening neuroblastoma tumors for DNMT3B7-expression may indicate particular patients for whom ATRA treatment might be particularly effective. DNMT3B exists in a protein complex with the mitotic chromatin condensation components, including HDAC1 and SIN3A (45). When unbound, retinoic acid receptors (RARs) bind NCOR2, SIN3A, and HDACs, leading to target promoter repression, which can be disassociated upon ATRA binding (46, 47).  Altered histone modifications have also been found in neuroblastoma tumors and have correlated to tumor aggressiveness. Elevated levels of EZH2, the enzymatically active component of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 and H3K27me3 marks have been identified at the promoters of tumor suppressors CASZ1, RUNX1, NGFR (p75), and NTRK1 (TrkA) in undifferentiated, poor prognosis neuroblastoma (48). Additionally, following retinoic acid induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, EZH2 expression is decreased, consistent with decreased binding of EZH2 to retinoic acid inducible target genes (49). Retinoic acid treatment therefore, leads to a reduction in repressive histone marks in addition to the changes in DNA methylation described above. Therefore, future work may focus on testing whether histone modifications are altered in this system.  Our findings suggest that forced expression of DNMT3B7 in neuroblastoma cells is able to drive genome-wide DNA methylation. This is similar to the effects seen in lymphomas that arise in Eμ-Myc/DNMT3B7 transgenic mice (21). However, in neuroblastoma, the expression of DNMT3B7 is anti-tumorigenic (Fig. 3), whereas DNMT3B7 expression in Eμ-Myc lymphomas accelerates tumorigenesis. There are many possible explanations for this: The observations are made in different species and cell types. In addition, there are no other aberrant DNMT3B transcripts present in the DNMT3B7-Eμ-Myc lymphomas, whereas the human LA1-55n neuroblastoma cell expresses multiple DNMT3B transcripts. Truncated DNMT3B proteins may fine-tune the DNA methylation machinery within a cell dependent upon the other active DNMTs. These studies provide insight into understanding the molecular basis for the altered distribution of DNA methylation seen in virtually all human cancers. We hope that our discoveries will also provide a basis for novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies that will be applicable to neuroblastoma and other types of tumors.  Cancer cells display an altered distribution of DNA methylation relative to normal cells. Certain tumor suppressor gene promoters are hypermethylated and transcriptionally inactivated, whereas repetitive DNA is hypomethylated and transcriptionally active. Little is understood about how the abnormal DNA methylation patterns of cancer cells are established and maintained. Here, we identify over 20 DNMT3B transcripts from many cancer cell lines and primary acute leukemia cells that contain aberrant splicing at the 5′ end of the gene, encoding truncated proteins lacking the C-terminal catalytic domain. Many of these aberrant transcripts retain intron sequences. Although the aberrant transcripts represent a minority of the DNMT3B transcripts present, Western blot analysis demonstrates truncated DNMT3B isoforms in the nuclear protein extracts of cancer cells. To test if expression of a truncated DNMT3B protein could alter the DNA methylation patterns within cells, we expressed DNMT3B7, the most frequently expressed aberrant transcript, in 293 cells. DNMT3B7-expressing 293 cells have altered gene expression as identified by microarray analysis. Some of these changes in gene expression correlate with altered DNA methylation of corresponding CpG islands. These results suggest that truncated DNMT3B proteins could play a role in the abnormal distribution of DNA methylation found in cancer cells.  Keywords: DNA methylation, DNMT3B, aberrant mRNA splicing, epigenetics Go to: Introduction Cytosine methylation and histone modifications play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of cellular genes (Robertson, 2005). DNA is methylated at the 5-C position of cytosines that are part of CpG dinucleotides. In normal cells, repetitive DNA is highly methylated and transcriptionally silenced, effectively inactivating transposable elements that could mediate genomic rearrangements. Open chromatin associated with actively transcribed genesis hypomethylated. DNA methylation is used to control gene expression in a variety of normal cellular processes, including X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting and aging.  Cancer cells are characterized by abnormal patterns of DNA methylation (Robertson, 2005). Repetitive DNA sequences are hypomethylated and transcriptionally active, and the altered chromatin structure of these regions is thought to contribute to the formation of some of the chromosomal rearrangements seen in cancer cells. Additionally, some gene promoters are hyper-methylated in tumor cells, resulting in transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes without accompanying inactivating mutations.  Three DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes have been identified in eukaryotic cells (Bestor, 2000; Rountree et al., 2001). DNMT1 is generally considered to be a maintenance methylase, although it also has de novo methylase activity (Bestor, 2000; Robertson, 2002). Both DNMT3A and DNMT 3B catalyse de novo methylation of DNA sequences (Li, 2002). Each of these three enzymes is essential for life, since homozygous knockout alleles of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b cause embryonic lethality in mice, and mice with homozygous knockout alleles of Dnmt3a die several weeks after birth (Li et al., 1992; Okano et al., 1999). Dnmt1 −/− embryonic stem cells display extensive demethylation of endogenous retroviral DNA (Li et al., 1992), and murine embryonic stem cells lacking Dnmt3b demonstrate hypomethylation of minor satellite sequences (Okano et al., 1999). Patients with a rare autosomal recessive syndrome, the immunodeficiency, centromere instability, facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, have germline mutations in the DNMT3B gene (Hansen et al., 1999; Xu et al., 1999; Shirohzu et al., 2002), and lymphocytes from affected individuals display hypomethylation of repetitive DNA sequences. Furthermore, mice expressing Dnmt3b alleles similar to those found in ICF syndrome are small with abnormal craniofacial development and hypomethylation of repetitive elements, suggesting that these alleles encode hypomorphic proteins (Ueda et al., 2006).  Numerous studies have implicated both DNMT1 and DNMT3B in the altered distribution of DNA methylation in cancer cells (Beaulieu et al., 2002; Robert et al., 2003). A human colon cancer cell line, HCT116 deficient in DNMT1 following targeted recombination, demonstrates demethylation of pericentromeric satellite sequences (Rhee et al., 2000), whereas HCT116 cells lacking both DNMT1 and DNMT3B contain demethylated satellite 2 and Alu repetitive sequences (Rhee et al., 2002) and demonstrate increased chromosomal instability (Karpf and Matsui, 2005). Additional studies of the doubly targeted cells suggest that at least some histone modifications occur before alterations in DNA methylation (Bachman et al., 2003). Mice expressing a hypomorphic Dnmt1 protein develop T-cell lymphomas (Gaudet et al., 2003), and when this deficiency is crossed into other tumor models, tumor incidence increases (Eden et al., 2003; Yamada et al., 2005). Dnmt3b deficiency inhibits the formation of macroadenomas in the murine Apc Min/+colon cancer model, indicating a requirement for Dnmt3b activity in the transition from microadenoma to tumor (Lin et al., 2006).  Experiments designed to understand the mechanism by which cancer cells have altered patterns of DNA methylation have not yielded a simple explanation. Mutations of the DNMT genes are rare in cancer cells (Kanai et al., 2003). Several groups have examined the expression of DNMT transcripts and have not found a correlation with DNA methylation levels in cancer cells (Robertson et al., 1999; Saito et al., 2002; Ehrlich et al., 2006). However, expression of transcripts that originate from a promoter within intron 4, ΔDNMT3B1-7, correlates with the DNA methylation states of the p16 and RASSF1A promoters in non-small-cell lung cancers (Wang et al., 2006a). Interestingly, several DNMT3B transcripts are predicted to encode proteins lacking critical parts of or the entire catalytic domain and therefore would produce catalytically inactive proteins: DNMT3B4 and DNMT3B5 encode proteins lacking the final two methyltransferase domains (Robertson et al., 1999), and three of the recently described transcripts from non-small-cell lung cancers, ΔDNMT3B5-7, also encode truncated DNMT3B proteins (Wang et al., 2006a, b).  To characterize the expression of the DNMT genes within cancer cells, we systematically amplified and sequenced the DNMT cDNAs from cancer cell lines. Here, we show that expression of abnormally spliced DNMT3B transcripts is common in cancer cell lines and in primary leukemia cells. We have identified over 20 aberrant DNMT3B transcripts from cancer cells, many of which contain intron sequences. Although only a minority of the DNMT3B transcripts in cancer cells displays aberrant transcription, truncated DNMT3B proteins are detectable in the nuclear protein extracts of cancer cell lines by Western blot analysis. To test if expression of a truncated DNM T3B protein can affect DNA methylation and gene expression, we engineered 293 cells to express the most frequently identified aberrant DNMT3B transcript, DNMT3B7. We identified genes whose expression level changed in the presence of DNMT3B7 using microarray-based expression profiling and showed that some gene expression changes correlate with altered DNA methylation of corresponding CpG islands. These results suggest that expression of truncated DNMT3B proteins could affect DNA methylation patterns and gene expression in cancer cells.  Go to: Results Cancer cells express aberrant DNMT3B transcripts  To examine potential mechanisms for the abnormal patterns of DNA methylation in cancer cells, we amplified the cDNAs encoding the three DNMT enzymes from several cancer cell lines using a high-fidelity polymerase. Although amplicons derived from the DNMT1 and DNMT3A cDNAs were wildtype in sequence (data not shown), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNMT3B cDNA from exon 9 to exon 13 produced the two expected amplification products (products A and B in Figure 1a) as well as an unexpected amplicon (product C in Figure 1a). Sequence analysis demonstrated that this novel transcript contained an aberrant splicing event from exon 9 to the 3′ end of intron 10, resulting in an insertion of 94 base pairs that is normally part of intron 10, located just 5′ to exon 11. We have named this transcript DNMT3B7 (Genbank Accession Number DQ321787; Figure 1b).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Cancer cells express aberrant DNMT3B transcripts as demonstrated by reverse-transcription PCR (RT–PCR). (a) DNMT3B cDNA was amplified from exon 9 to exon 13 in several cancer cell lines. DNA sizing is shown at the left. Product A is derived from ... To determine whether aberrant DNMT3B7 transcripts were expressed in cancer cell lines of diverse origins, we expanded our screen to include 25 established cancer cell lines derived from both hematopoietic malignancies (11 cell lines) as well as solid tumors (14 cell lines), and30 primary acute leukemia samples (27 acute myeloid leukemia samples and three acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples) (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). DNMT3B transcripts involving aberrant splicing events at the 5′ end of the gene could be detected in all of the samples tested, except in HepG2 and Alexander cells, derived from hepatocellular carcinomas. Alexander cells are known to express DNMT3B4, which encodes a catalytically inactive DNMT3B isoform (Saito et al., 2002). All of the primary leukemia samples expressed a transcript containing aberrant splicing between exons 9 and13 as originally observed, confirming that the expression of these novel mRNAs was not due to an artifact of in vitro culture. Notably, there was expression of at least one of the three wild-type DNMT3B transcripts in all of the tumor cell line-derived cDNAs as well as in all of the primary leukemia samples, in keeping with previous data that complete loss of DNMT3B activity is incompatible with viability (Li et al., 1992; Okano et al., 1999).  Table 1 Table 1 Expression of DNMT3B transcripts in cancer cell lines and primary acute leukemias Most of the aberrantly spliced DNMT3B transcripts contain sequences that are normally intronic and lack various exons, and all of them encode truncated DNMT3B proteins containing novel amino acids but lacking the catalytic C terminus. Supplementary Table 1 lists the properties of each aberrant transcript. We noted alternative splicing of several 5′ exons, including exon 5 (Xu et al., 1999). The 5′ half of each transcript could be amplified using a primer derived from exon 1A (data not shown), suggesting that the promoter originally identified for DNMT3B is used to generate the aberrant transcripts (Yanagisawa et al., 2002).  To quantitate the levels of aberrant DNMT3B transcripts in cancer cells precisely, we performed quantitative reverse transcription PCR (QRT–PCR) of DNMT3B transcripts. Two assays were designed: the first assay assessed the levels of aberrant DNMT3B transcripts containing intron 10 sequences by placing the forward primer in exon 9, and the reverse primer and Taqman probe within the retained intron sequence. The second assay assessed total DNMT3B transcript levels, by placing the forward primer in exon 12, and the reverse primer and Taqm an probe within exon 13, because neither exon 12 nor exon 13 is subject to alternative splicing. QRT–PCR of eight normal human tissues (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) demonstrated no detectable aberrant DNMT3B transcripts, whereas 2–5% of DNMT3B transcripts in cancer cell lines derived from both solid and hematopoietic tumors contained intron 10 sequences (Table 2).  Table 2 Table 2 Expression of DNMT3B transcripts containing intron 10 sequence Cancer cells express truncated DNMT3B proteins  Although aberrant transcripts represent a minority of DNMT3B transcripts, we next tested whet her truncated DNMT3B proteins were detectable by Western blotting in protein extracts from cancer cells. All of the aberrant DNMT3B transcripts contain premature stop codons and are predicted to produce truncated DNMT3B proteins lacking the two strongest nuclear localization signals. Therefore, we tested both cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts from SK-BR-3 cells (a breast cancer cell line) and HeLa cells (a cervical cancer cell line). The full-length DNMT3B (96 kDa) as well as the truncated DNMT 3B7 (40 kDa) protein were observed in the nuclear protein fractions by Western blot analysis using an N-terminal-specific anti-DNMT3B antibody (Figure 2a, upper panel). The signals were competed away with the respective antigenic peptides for each of the antibodies tested (Figure 2a, middle panel), confirming that the observed signal s were DNMT3B-derived species. Similar results were obtained with two other anti-DNMT3B antibodies as well as nuclear protein extracts from MDA-MB-231 andK562 cells (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Identification of truncated DNMT3B proteins by Western blotting. (a) Identification of truncated DNMT3B proteins in extracts from cancer cell lines. Upper panel, cytosolic and nuclear extracts (60 μg each) from SK-BR-3 and HeLa were probed for ... To determine if low levels of a truncated DNMT3B protein could alter DNA methylation levels, we isolated 293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) that stably express DNMT3B7 (Table 2 and Figure 2b, upper panel). Although QRT–PCR indicated that 40–50% of DNMT3B transcripts within transfected cells encoded DNMT3B7 (Table 2), Western blot analysis demonstrated that the truncated protein represented a minority of DNMT3B protein within transfected cell s (Figure 2b, upper panel), as we observed in cancer cells. Therefore, DNMT3B7-expressing 293 cells could serve as a reasonable model of the relative amounts of full-length versus truncatedDNMT3B proteins found in cancer cells. We characterized the phenotype of two independently derived clones expressing DNMT3B7 compared to vector-transfected cells.  DNMT3B7-expressing 293 cells demonstrate gene expression changes that correspond with altered DNA methylation within some CpG islands  We used microarray analysis to compare the gene expression changes found in DNMT3B7-expressing cells versus vector-transfected cell s. Three independently isolated RNA samples from DNMT3B7-expressing line 1 and line 2 cells were used as probes hybridized to Affymetrix Gene Chip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays. These samples were compared to four independently isolated RNA samples from vector-transfected cells. We searched for genes whose expression levels differed statistically between the two DNMT3B7-expressing lines and the vector-transfected cells, but not between the two DNMT3B7-expressing lines themselves. Fifty-one genes fulfilled these criteria (Figure 3): 27 genes were under expressed in the DNMT3B7-expressing cells, and24 genes were overexpressed. Interestingly, more than half of the genes whose expression changed are located on chromosomes 1, 16 and X, and75% of the overexpressed genes are located on those chromosomes.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Gene expression changes in DNMT3B7-expressing 293 cells. A heat map shows the 51 genes whose expression changed with DNMT3B7 expression (red, overexpression; blue, under expression). Four samples of vector-transfected cells were compared to three samples ... We reasoned that at least some of the gene expression changes that we observed were likely to involve changes in DNA methylation of corresponding CpG islands. Genes whose expression decreased with DNMT3B7 expression would be expected to have increased CpG island/promoter methylation, whereas genes whose expression increased with DNMT3B7 expression would be expected to have less DNA methylation of their CpG islands/promoters. We isolated genomic DNA from transfected cell s and treated it with sodium bisulfite, which chemically converts unmethylated cytosine to uracil, but does not alter methylated cytosine. We analysed the DNA methylation state of particular CpG islands by PCR amplification and sequencing in vector-transfected versus DNMT3B7-expressing 293 cells. We observed changes in the DNA methylation state of the CpG islands/promoters of four genes whose expression was altered in DNMT3B7-expressing cells, in parallel to what is observed in cancer cells (Figure 4).  Figure 4 Figure 4 293 cells overexpressing DNMT3B7 demonstrate gene expression changes that correspond with altered DNA methylation within some CpG islands as determined by sodium bisulfite analysis. Methylated CpG dinucleotides are represented by filled-in black circles, ... The E-cadherin (CDH1) gene is hypermethylated and transcriptionally repressed in gastric and breast cancers, myeloid malignancies, and other tumors (Cowin et al., 2005; Aggerholm et al., 2006; Chan, 2006). We observed hypermethylation of the CDH1 CpG island (Figure 4a), corresponding to a 2.19-fold decrease in gene expression (Figure 3). One CpG dinucleotide (No. 2, Figure 4a) is contained within the known Sp1-binding site located closest to the gene’s transcriptional start.  The X-linked MAGEA3 gene is hypomethylated and overexpressed in melanoma (Sigalotti et al., 2002), and the methylation status of the regulatory regions of SH2D1A, the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease gene, correlates with tissue-specific expression (Parolini et al., 2003). Hypomethylation of the CpG islands associated with the MAGEA3 and SH2D1A genes also correlated with increased expression, 2.54- and -3.05- fold, respectively (Figures 4b, d and 3). In addition, we observed hypo methylation of the CpG island of PLP2, a gene located at Xp11.2, which exhibited 2.85-fold increased expression in DNMT3B7-expressing cells (Figures 4c and 3). Interestingly, most of the DNA methylation changes were located in the part of the CpG island just 5′ to the transcriptional start site of the gene, but there was also some demethylation that extended well past the gene’s translational start. We confirmed that increased gene expression from the X chromosome occurred from the active X chromosome, rather than from re-activation of gene expression from the inactive X chromosomes, using an informative SNP in the X-linked MID1 gene in 293 cells (a T/C allele at position 10247528; SNP rs16986145) (data not shown).  Go to: Discussion In this paper, we demonstrate that cancer cells express numerous aberrant splice variants of the DNMT3B gene, all of which are predicted to encode truncated proteins lacking the catalytic C-terminus. Western blotting of cancer cell extracts demonstrates that truncatedDNMT3B proteins are present in nuclear protein extracts, despite low levels of aberrant DNMT3B transcripts. When expressed in 293 cells, DNMT3B7, the most frequently observed truncated protein, causes altered gene expression with corresponding changes in the DNA methylation states of several CpG islands. These findings suggest that truncated DNMT3B proteins could influence the DNA methylation state of cancer cells.  Our extensive analysis of 25 cancer cell lines indicates that aberrant DNMT3B transcription is extremely widespread in cancer. The only tumor type in which we did not observe novel DNMT3B transcripts was hepatocellular carcinoma. Interestingly, Alexander cells, derived from hepatocellular carcinomas, are known to express DNMT3B4, which encodes a catalytically inactive DNMT3B isoform (Saito et al., 2002). Furthermore, recently described transcripts from non-small-cell lung cancers, ΔDNMT3B5-7, are also predicted to encode truncated DNMT3B proteins lacking the catalytic domain (Wang et al., 2006a, b). Therefore, it appears that many cancer cells express full-length DNMT3B catalytically active proteins as well as truncated DNMT 3B proteins that are predicted to be catalytically inactive.  We used microarray analysis to indicate which genes showed altered transcription in DNMT3B7-expressing cells, and some of these changes in gene expression correlated with DNA methylation of corresponding CpG islands. Almost all of the changes in DNA methylation levels were stronger in the 293 cells that expressed higher DNMT3B7 levels (line 2), suggesting that subtle changes in levels of catalytically inactive DNMT3B proteins could have significant effects in cells over the many generations of cell divisions that occur during tumor formation and growth.  Our studies show that the most common of the truncated proteins, DNMT3B7, is concentrated in the nucleus, suggesting that the nucleus is the major site of its activity. DNMT3B7 may localize to the nucleus via the retention of one weak nuclear localization signal or via binding to a protein that could shuttle it into the nucleus. We can envision several models by which DNMT3B7 could affect DNA methylation, and consequently, gene expression:  DNMT3B7 may interfere with the normal DNA methylation machinery by binding one or more of the known DNMT3B binding partners. Several proteins have been shown to bind DNMT 3B, including SUMO-1 and UBC-9, two components of the sumoylation pathway (Kang et al., 2001); h-CAP-C and hCA P-E, two components of the condensin complex; KIF4A, a chromokinesin homolog; hSNF2H, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme; HDAC1, a histone deacetylase; and SIN3A, a transcriptional corepressor (Geiman et al., 2004a). DNMT3B is also known to interact with HDAC2 (Geiman et al., 2004b) andDNMT1 (Kim et al., 2002), although the precise binding regions have not been defined. In addition, the PHD domain of murine Dnmt3b, which is located in the N-terminus, mediates binding to Suv39h1 andHP1 proteins, both of which are components of the histone methylation machinery (Geiman et al., 2004b). DNMT3B7 may bind DNA directly and affect the activity of active DNMTs. DNMT3B7 may affect DNA methylation as outlined above, which could in turn lead to alterations in histone modifications. Mice lacking histone H1 showed alterations in DNA methylation levels and consequent gene expression changes in relatively few genes, often in imprinted genes or genes located on the X chromosome (Fan et al., 2005). In addition, histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels increased after patients received 5-azacytidine, a global hypomethylating agent (Gore et al., 2006). Interestingly, the genes that were overexpressed in DNMT3B7-expressing cells were over-represented on chromosomes 1, 16 and X. Cells from patients with ICF Syndrome contain dramatically hypomethylated repetitive DNA sequences of the satellite 2 repeats concentrated at the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes 1 and16 and of the satellite 3 repeats found near the centromere of chromosome 9 (Ehrlich, 2003) as well as hypomethylation of the LINE-1 elements located on the inactive X chromosome (Hansen, 2003). We did not observe significant hypomethylation of repetitive elements in our DNMT3B7-expressing 293 cells, possibly because they have relatively under methylated repetitive sequences at baseline (data not shown).  Aberrant processing of mRNAs in tumor cells has been described for the MDM2, RasGRP4, SLP-65, TLE1, TLE4, MTA1 and CD44 genes and is emerging as an important characteristic of tumor cells (Bartel et al., 2002; Kumar et al., 2002; Reuther et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2002; Jumaa et al., 2003; Venables, 2004; Watermann et al., 2006) and is observed in other diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy (Charlet-B et al., 2002). In aberrant splicing, portions of exons, portions of introns or both are retained within transcripts that fail to be purged by the cellular pathways designed to scavenge abnormal mRNAs, such as nonsense-mediated decay (Culbertson, 1999; Wilkinson and Shyu, 2002). Often, the aberrant mRNAs produce truncated proteins that in some cases allow them to function in a dominant-negative manner. The aberrant transcripts do not represent intermediates of the normal splicing reaction, because they are found in the cytoplasm and are translated. The cellular abnormalities that lead to aberrant mRNA processing and possible defects in nonsense-mediated decay are not clear, but represent an exciting opportunity for future studies.  In summary, our paper is the first to demonstrate that a wide variety of cancer cells exhibit aberrant splicing of the DNMT3B gene, producing transcripts that encode truncated protein s lacking the C-terminal catalytic domain. Our data support a model in which aberrations in mRNA splicing in cancer cells give rise to truncated DNMT3B proteins, resulting in changes in DNA methylation patterns and gene expression. These results suggest that the abnormal patterns of DNA methylation present in nearly all cancer cells may be regulated in part by the presence of catalytically inactive DNMT3B proteins. Further work in which levels of aberrant DNMT3B transcripts and/or truncated DNMT3B proteins are varied within cancer cells may help to confirm this model. Future experiments could also address whether truncated DNMT3B proteins affect epigenetic modifications in addition to DNA methylation, such as histone alterations. Overall, our work supports growing evidence that aberrant gene splicing in cancer cells affects cellular phenotype.  
3114||Recently, the high mobility group protein gene HMGIC was identified as the chromosome 12q15 target gene in a variety of benign solid tumors. Here, we report that the recombinational repair gene RAD51B on chromosome 14q23–24 is the preferential translocation partner of HMGIC in uterine leiomyomas. The pathogenetically critical sequences seem to reside in the last coding exon of a novel RAD51B isoform, which encode a domain containing a putative transmembrane anchor and are expressed in the uterus but not in a wide variety of other tissues tested. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, rapid amplification of 3* cDNA ends, and reverse transcription-PCR analysis, we demonstrated consistent chromosomal rearrangements within RAD51B and expression of fusion transcripts, structurally resulting in an allelic knockout of the uterine isoform of RAD51B and confirming a pleiotropic function of this gene. Introduction Uterine leiomyoma is the most common pelvic neoplasm in women, leading to over 200,000 hysterectomies annually in the United States (1, 2). A major cytogenetic subgroup among these steroid-dependent tumors is characterized by a t(12;14)(q15;q23–24) (3). Previously, it was reported that HMGIC, which encodes an architectural transcription factor, is targeted by the chromosome 12q15 aberrations in uterine leiomyomas as well as a variety of other, mostly mesenchymal tumors (4, 5). In contrast to the highly variable translocation partners in the latter, uterine leiomyomas almost exclusively use chromosome 14q23–24 as a partner (3). The chromosome 14 translocation breakpoint cluster region has been studied in more detail (6, 7), but the corresponding target gene remains to be identified and the pathogenetic mechanism remains to be characterized. Aiming at the identification of the 14q34–24 pathogenetical sequences, we have now established a YAC3 contig encompassing the chromosome 14 breakpoint cluster region (ULCR14). Subsequent gene identification studies within ULCR14 revealed that RAD51B [Ref. 8; also known as R51H2 (9) and hREC2 (10), a member of the recA/RAD51 recombination repair gene family (11)] is the chromosome 14 target gene and HMGIC fusion partner in uterine leiomyomas with t(12;14). To map the breakpoints, we defined the genomic organization of the RAD51B gene. Furthermore, we describe the identification of a novel isoform of RAD51B and establish its expression pattern by Northern blot analysis. Finally, to pinpoint the pathogenetically critical sequences, we performed 39-RACE and RT-PCR analyses and identified and structurally characterized fusion transcripts resulting from the t(12;14)(q15;q23–24) translocations. Materials and Methods YAC/BAC Contig and Long-Range Physical Map. YAC clones were isolated from local copies of the Centre d’E´tude du Polymorphisme Humain mark 1 and mark 3 YAC libraries. BAC clones were identified on commercially obtained high-density grids (Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, AL) by colony hybridization. YACs and BACs were further analyzed essentially as described previously (Ref. 4 and references therein). Generation of YAC- and BAC-derived STSs. Sequence data from YAC insert ends were obtained using a vectorette-PCR procedure in combination with direct DNA sequencing analysis (4). Sequence data from BAC insert ends were obtained by direct cycle sequencing using either standard FITC-labeled or Energy Transfer (C-FAM-labeled) T7 and SP6 primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Roosendaal, the Netherlands). After sequence analysis, specific primer pairs were developed using LASERGENE biocomputing software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). PCRs. PCR amplifications were carried out using a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 or 9600 or a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) in final volumes of 50 ml containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 2 mM dNTPs, 20 pmol of each oligonucleotide (Eurogentec), 2.5 units of Amplitaq (Perkin-Elmer/Cetus), and 5 ng (for cosmids) to 100 ng (for YAC superpools) of template DNA. For G1C-rich templates, DMSO was added to a final concentration of 10%. After initial denaturation for 5 min at 94°C, 30 amplification cycles were performed, each consisting of denaturation for 10 s at 94°C, annealing for 20 s at the appropriate temperature, and extension for 30 s–1 min at 72°C. The PCR was completed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. Results were evaluated by analysis of 10 ml of the reaction product on polyacrylamide minigels. Cell Culture. Cell lines containing the classical t(12;14) that were used in this study were established through transfection of primary leiomyoma tumor cells with a construct containing the SV40 early region and have been described previously (4). Cells were grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Merelbeke, Belgium) and were assayed by standard cytogenetic techniques at regular intervals. FISH. Cells of tumor cell lines were arrested in metaphase using colcemid, after which FISH analysis was performed essentially as described previously (4). Inter-Alu-PCRed YAC DNA or BAC DNA was labeled with either biotin-14-dATP or digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) using the Bionick labeling system (Life Technologies) or the Nick translation system (Life Technologies). The identity of chromosomes was established by simultaneous 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole banding. Vectashield antifade medium (Vector Laboratories), containing 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.5 g/ml) was added 15 min before slides were analyzed on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled charged coupled device camera system (Photometrics) using Quips Smart Capture FISH imaging software (Vysis Inc.). Images were printed with a Phaser 440 sublimation printer (Tektronix). RACE and RT-PCR. 39-RACE and RT-PCR was performed using part of a modified 39 exon trapping protocol (4). For first strand cDNA synthesis, nonspecific adapter primer AP2 [59-AAG GAT CCG TCG ACA TC(T)17-39] or HMGI-C-specific primer 95C3362 [59-TAC AGC AGT TTT TCA CTA-39] was used.

CAU-tailing of the second round primers allowed the use of the directional CloneAmp cloning system (Life Technologies). Results and Discussion Development of a 14q23–24 YAC and BAC Contig. Using as starting points STS RM121 [corresponding to genomic t(12;14) breakpoint flanking sequences residing on chromosome 14; Ref. 12] and expressed sequence tag CH165 (corresponding to ectopic chromosome 14 sequences, which were isolated following a HMGI-C 39-RACE experiment; Ref. 13), we constructed a YAC and BAC contig consisting of over 100 overlapping YACs and BACs as well as a corresponding rare-cutter physical map spanning ;2.7 Mb.4 FISH Definition of ULCR14. Using well-characterized contig elements (mainly BACs or STS-specific genomic lambda clones) from this 2.7-Mb contig in FISH experiments, we were able to define a uterine leiomyoma breakpoint cluster region on chromosome 14q23–24 (ULCR14), in which all of the chromosome 14q23–24 breakpoints under investigation appeared to cluster. This cluster region, which by FISH analysis (seven cases) was defined as the region mapping between STS CH308 (contained within BAC 8A21) and ETS CH457 (contained within BAC 547J11), comprised a genomic interval of ;900 kb (Fig. 1). FISH analysis on normal metaphase spreads confirmed the reported mapping of ULCR14 at the border between 14q23 and 14q24 (results not shown). Subsequent integration 4 Unpublished data. Fig. 1. Genomic organization of the RAD51B gene on chromosome 14 and expression- profiling of novel splice variants. Right, genetic, radiation, and physical (relative to marker AFMA116XD5) maps encompassing the chromosome 14 breakpoint region of uterine leiomyomas (ULCR14), including the relative mapping positions and transcriptional orientations of the RAD51B gene as well as two other known genes, i.e., ACTN1, encoding a cytoskeleton isoform of a-actinin, and EIF2A, encoding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a. The relative positions of anonymous expressed sequence tags (black bars) and STSs are also given. The exon/intron distribution of RAD51B is also given schematically, with indication of the encoded amino acid residues next to the corresponding exons. The alternatively spliced terminal coding exons are exons 11a –11c , and they contain different coding sequences. Left, Northern blot analysis revealed low-level (blot exposure was 14 days) expression of three related transcripts in specimens from uterus (with and without endometrium) but none in a variety of human fetal and adult tissue specimens and cell lines. These transcripts were shown in further studies to represent alternative splice variants of RAD51B. It should be noted, furthermore, that, thus far, Northern blot level expression of exon 11c has been detected only in primary uterine tissue, indicative for its tissue-restricted expression. Only a portion of the Northern blot results is shown. Included in these studies were, furthermore: (a) human adult tissue, including brain, colon (mucosal lining), kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, peripheral blood leukocytes, placenta, stomach, spleen, and thymus; (b) human fetal tissue, including brain, kidney, liver, and lung; and (c) cell lines, including A549 (lung carcinoma), G361 (melanoma), HeLa, HL60 (promyelocytic leukemia), K562 (CML), MOLT-4 (lymphoblastic leukemia), Raji (Burkitt’s lymphoma), and SW480 (colorectal adenocarcinoma).

(i.e., mapping) of published, well-characterized landmarks situated ULCR14 at ;62–64 cM relative to the most proximal (14pter) polymorphic marker, at a radiation hybrid position of 249–250 cR, at 0.7–1.6 Mb distal to AFMA116XD5 (Fig. 1). Isolation and Characterization of Transcribed Sequences within ULCR14. Using a variety of gene identification techniques (including random sequence sampling and 39 exon trapping), we identified several independent expressed sequences mapping within our 2.7-Mb contig. Among transcribed sequences residing within ULCR14 (Fig. 1, right), those detected by Northern blot analysis with probe CH457 were particularly intriguing because they appeared to be part of transcripts of ;4.4 (major band), 7.0, and 1.6 (minor bands) kb expressed at low levels in uterus but not in any of the many other tissues and cell lines tested (Fig. 1, left). Evaluation of corresponding cDNAs, isolated from cDNA libraries of human uterus and fetal brain, revealed CH457 sequences inframe fused to sequences of the RAD51B gene (8). This observation was subsequently confirmed by RT-PCR. RAD51B expression (1.8-kb mRNA isoforms) is ubiquitous; more abundant, consistent with its proposed role in DNA repair; radiation inducible; and most prominent in tissues active in recombination (8–10). Our results, therefore, clearly indicate the existence of as yet unknown, uterine splice variants of RAD51B. Interestingly, characterization of independent cDNA clones also indicated the presence of alternative polyadenylation signals within exon 11c because clones polyadenylating at different positions were isolated. Taking also into consideration the fact that splicing within the 39 untranslated region of genes is a very rare event, the use of alternative polyadenylation signals (possibly combined with exon skipping) is, therefore, very likely to be responsible for the various transcript sizes detected in Northern blots. Structural Characterization of RAD51B. The established exon/ intron distribution revealed that RAD51B is composed of 13 exons, the last three of which serve as alternative last exons (Table 1). Subsequent physical mapping of these exons revealed that RAD51B has a genomic size of ;900 kb, almost completely encompassing ULCR14 (Fig. 1), with all characterized breakpoints mapping upstream of exon 11c (Fig. 2A, arrows). Furthermore, Internet-mediated (protein) motif searching (at http://coot.embl-heidelberg.de/SMART/) revealed that RAD51B splice variants containing the unique stretch of 80 amino acids encoded by exon 11c contain a putative COOH-terminal transmembrane segment not present in the two previously published splice variants of RAD51B. 3* RACE Analysis and RT-PCR. Using 39-RACE and RT-PCR analysis, we evaluated the existence of t(12;14) translocation-induced hybrid transcripts in six independent uterine leiomyoma specimens, all originating from different patients. 17 Independent clones containing fused sequences were fully characterized. Our results (schematically represented in Fig. 2) revealed that the predicted reading frames of the RAD51B/HMGIC transcripts code for variant truncations of the RAD51B protein, all lacking the 39 terminal exon (i.e., exon 11c , which encodes the 80-amino acid domain) and containing variable COOH-terminal ends, in some cases encoded by frameshifted HMGIC sequences. An important subgroup of RAD51B/HMGIC hybrids is expected to resemble the fusion transcript in LM-30.1 because the chromosome 12 breakpoints have been reported to frequently map upstream of HMGIC (14), thereby excluding the existence of reciprocal (i.e., HMGIC/RAD51B) transcripts and, consequently, excluding Table 1 Genomic organization of the human RAD51B gene Exon 39 splice sitea 59 splice sitea Exon size (bp) Intron size (kbp)b 1c GCA GAC CCG gtactggaaa 56 ,50 2 ggatctggag GC ATG GGT ACC TGT CAG gtaaatttta 86d ,50 Met Gly Thr Cys Gln28 3 gtttcttgag GAC TTT TTA ATG CAA ACG gtatatttat 114 ,50 Asp Phe Leu Met Gln Thr66 4 tcttgtttag GCT TAT GGG CTG ACA GAG gtaaaggaaa 117 ,50 Ala Tyr Gly Leu Thr Glu105 5 tttwttttag ATT ACA GGT GCT GAA AG gtatgagatw 137 ,50 Ile Thr Gly Ala Glu Ar151 6 tcacccacag A CTG GTT CTA CAA AG gtatgctgct 120 ,50 g Leu Val Leu Gln Ar191 7 tcttttatag G ATT GAA TCA ATC CCA gtragtkttt 184 .260 g Ile Glu Ser Ile Pro252 8 ctgttcacag GTT ATC TTG TCT GAA G gtaaggaatc 97 30–190 Val Ile Leu Ser Glu G285 9 ttcatttcag GC ACT TCT AGA AGA CAG gtgggtgctt 104 45–110 ly Thr Ser Arg Arg Gln319 10 ttatgtgcag ATT CTT ATT CTT CAA G gtaagatcct 79 9 Ile Leu Ile Leu Gln G346 A346 V346 11-a tttcctttag GC CAG GAG (GTC TAC CAG 3 (A)n) 0.4ke 19 ly Gln Glu 11-b cttcttgcag CC TAT GGA (TAT AGT GTC 3 (A)n) 0.7kf .110 la Tyr Gly 11-c1 catttcacag TT GTT AGA (TAT CAT GCC 3 (A)n) 1.2kg al Val Arg 11-c2 catttcacag TT GTT AGA NDh ND al Val Arg 11-c3 catttcacaag TT GTT AGA ND ND al Val Arg a Exon and intron sequences are shown in upper- and lowercase letters, respectively.

Furthermore, also in specimens in which breakpoints occurred within HMGIC, such reciprocal fusion transcripts were detected only in a few cases (Fig. 2). Expression in the tumors of wild-type RAD51B and HMGIC transcripts was demonstrated by RT-PCR. Interestingly, RAD51B splice variants containing exon 11c were only detected in primary tumor samples investigated but not in any of the SV40 early region-transformed leiomyoma-derived cell lines tested thus far, thereby confirming the observed stringent tissue-specific splicing of this particular exon. Conclusions. On the basis of the data generated during the 39- RACE and RT-PCR experiments, we propose that allelic knockout of particular uterine splice variants of RAD51B, resulting in expression of truncated and COOH-terminally altered RAD51B proteins, and dysregulation of HMGIC are tumor-specific features of uterine leiomyomas with t(12;14)(q15;q23–24) translocations. Pathogenetically, the observed dysregulations of RAD51B and HMGIC most likely act in conjunction, the former most probably conveying a tissue-dependent and the latter a more common effect. Furthermore, the link of RAD51B to tumorigenesis suggests that this gene may play Fig. 2. Expression of hybrid transcripts in uterine leiomyoma, resulting from t(12;14)(q15;q23– 24)-induced fusions between RAD51B and HMGIC. RT-PCR and 39-RACE analyses were performed on cytogenetically well-characterized uterine leiomyomas. As an illustration, only the results of five representative and fully characterized cases (LM-30.1, LM-65, LM-100, LM-608, and LM-196.4) are presented. Primer sets used were designed on the basis of newly identified as well as known RAD51B (7–9) and HMGIC (4) sequences. Experimental conditions were as described previously (4). A, wild-type mRNAs (with numbered exons) and deduced proteins of the developmentally regulated HMGIC gene (in blue) and the alternatively spliced RAD51B (in red) are depicted. The two highly conserved nucleotide binding Walker domains in RAD51B are marked (triangles) and the number of amino acids encoded by the three alternative terminal coding exons are indicated. Arrows indicate corresponding chromosome 12 and 14 breakpoints. B, HMGIC/RAD51B hybrid transcript (with numbered exons) and corresponding deduced fusion protein, as detected in cells of some of the uterine leiomyomas, as indicated. The three DNA binding domains encoded by exons 1–3 of HMGIC are marked. C, RAD51B/ HMGIC hybrid transcripts and deduced fusion proteins, as detected in cells of the indicated uterine leiomyomas. Amino acid stretches encoded by frameshifted HMGIC sequences are depicted in green. Note that, in cases similar to LM-30.1, in which the chromosome 12 breakpoints occur upstream of exon 1 of HMGIC, no reciprocal HMGIC/RAD51B transcripts can be formed. Furthermore, the fact that HMGIC exon 1 is devoid of a 39 splice site results in the removal of this exon during the processing of a primary RAD51B/ HMGIC fusion transcript, as is depicted in C. 22 RAD51B INVOLVEMENT IN UTERINE LEIOMYOMAS Downloaded from cancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 27, 2017. © 1999 American Association for Cancer Research.  a role in addition to its presumed recombination repair function. In line with such a pleiotropic, possibly splicing-dependent, role of RAD51B are observations with highly related family member RAD51A, which has been shown to promote ATP-dependent homologous pairing and strand transfer reactions in vitro (15), play an essential role in mammalian cell viability (16, 17), and be linked etiologically to cancers, because of its interaction with p53 (18), BCRA1 (19), and BCRA2 (20). Our data offer new viewpoints and unique tools for dissecting the tumorigenic processes in uterine leiomyoma and for deciphering functions of the intriguing recombination repair gene family   ABSTRACT Uterine leiomyomas are common benign smooth muscle tumors that impose a major burden on women’s health. Recent sequencing studies have revealed recurrent and mutually exclusive mutations in leiomyomas, suggesting the involvement of molecularly distinct pathways. In this study, we explored transcriptional differences among leiomyomas harboring different genetic drivers, including high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) rearrangements, mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) mutations, biallelic inactivation of fumarate hydratase (FH), and collagen, type IV, alpha 5 and collagen, type IV, alpha 6 (COL4A5-COL4A6) deletions. We also explored the transcriptional consequences of 7q22, 22q, and 1p deletions, aiming to identify possible target genes. We investigated 94 leiomyomas and 60 corresponding myometrial tissues using exon arrays, whole genome sequencing, and SNP arrays. This integrative approach revealed subtype-specific expression changes in key driver pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, Prolactin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)1 signaling. Leiomyomas with HMGA2 aberrations displayed highly significant up-regulation of the proto-oncogene pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1), suggesting that HMGA2 promotes tumorigenesis through PLAG1 activation. This was supported by the identification of genetic PLAG1 alterations resulting in expression signatures as seen in leiomyomas with HMGA2 aberrations. RAD51 paralog B (RAD51B), the preferential translocation partner of HMGA2, was up-regulated in MED12 mutant lesions, suggesting a role for this gene in the genesis of leiomyomas. FH-deficient leiomyomas were uniquely characterized by activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) target genes, supporting the hypothesis that accumulation of fumarate leads to activation of the oncogenic transcription factor NRF2. This study emphasizes the need for molecular stratification in leiomyoma research and possibly in clinical practice as well. Further research is needed to determine whether the candidate biomarkers presented herein can provide guidance for managing the millions of patients affected by these lesions.  Uterine leiomyomas, also known as fibroids, are highly common benign tumors arising from the smooth muscle cells of the myometrium. Leiomyomas can cause a variety of health complications and are the leading indication for hysterectomy (1). The clinical and scientific community widely regards leiomyomas as a single entity, although substantial evidence of heterogeneity exists at several different levels, including symptoms, histopathology, therapeutic requirements, and genetic changes (2).  In terms of genetics, recent high-throughput sequencing studies have identified recurrent and mutually exclusive mutations in a limited number of key genes (3, 4), indicating the existence of molecularly distinct subtypes of leiomyomas. The currently established driver changes include high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) rearrangements, mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) mutations, and biallelic inactivation of fumarate hydratase (FH) (5). Leiomyomas with deletions affecting collagen, type IV, alpha 5 and collagen, type IV, alpha 6 (COL4A5-COL4A6) may constitute a rare fourth subtype (4). HMGA2 and MED12 represent the two most common driver genes and together contribute to 80–90% of all leiomyomas (5).  Less frequently, leiomyomas harbor 6p21 rearrangements affecting high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1) (6). Some of these rearrangements have been reported to co-occur with MED12 mutations, suggesting that a subset of HMGA1 rearrangements are secondary events (7). Leiomyomas also may harbor recurrent deletions and rearrangements of 7q22, 22q, and 1p (8–11). These deletions co-occur with other genetic alterations and may be secondary driver events, often present only in a subpopulation of tumor cells (4, 7, 8, 11–13).  Although several genetic defects underlying the development of leiomyomas have been discovered, the mechanisms of tumorigenesis remain poorly understood, and whether these mutations affect the same or different driver pathways is unclear. Previous expression profiling studies have discovered that hundreds of genes are differentially expressed between leiomyomas and normal myometrial tissue (9, 14–20); however, the majority of these studies have not accounted for the genetic background of the lesions examined. Therefore, we sought to explore the transcriptional differences and similarities among 94 leiomyomas from 60 patients harboring different genetic driver alterations, including HMGA2 rearrangements, MED12 mutations, biallelic inactivation of FH, COL4A5-COL4A6 deletions, and leiomyomas lacking these four driver changes, henceforth termed quadruple-negative leiomyomas. We also explored the transcriptional consequences of recurrent 7q22, 22q, and 1p deletions, aiming to identify the possible target genes.  Go to: RESULTS Unsupervised Hierarchical Clustering Reveals Distinct Expression Profiles Associated with Specific Driver Mutations. To identify possible expression patterns associated with driver mutations, we integrated genome-wide expression and genomic data of 94 leiomyomas. The selection of these leiomyomas is described in detail in SI Materials and Methods. As determined by the screening of known driver changes using whole genome sequencing (WGS), SNP arrays, and MED12 sequencing, the 94 leiomyomas included 27 with an HMGA2 rearrangement, 34 with a MED12 mutation, 10 with biallelic loss of FH, and 4 with a COL4A5-COL4A6 deletion (Dataset S1). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of exon array data revealed that the vast majority of leiomyomas clustered according to the mutation status of these four driver genes (Fig. 1).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 94 leiomyomas from 60 patients. Hierarchical clustering using 1% most variable genes revealed that most leiomyomas grouped together according to the mutation status of MED12 (green), HMGA2 (blue), FH (red), and ... Pathway Enrichment Analysis Using Differentially Expressed Genes. To identify genes differentially expressed in the complete set of leiomyomas, we compared all 94 leiomyomas against the corresponding 60 myometrium tissue specimens. This comparison identified 135 genes as significantly differentially expressed [q <0.05; –2> fold change (FC) >2] (Dataset S2). Zinc finger, matrin type 3 (ZMAT3) was the most significant gene, up-regulated in all leiomyomas regardless of subtype (Fig. 2A).  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Examples of shared and uniquely expressed genes. (A) ZMAT3 was the most significantly differentially expressed gene in all leiomyomas compared with the normal myometrial tissue (brown). (B) HMGA2 was the most uniquely expressed gene in leiomyomas of the ... To identify genes differentially expressed in leiomyomas of the HMGA2, MED12, FH, and COL4A5-COL4A6 subtypes, we compared leiomyomas of each subtype against all of the myometrium tissue specimens. This revealed 265 genes significantly differentially expressed in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 subtype, 258 genes significantly differentially expressed in leiomyomas of the MED12 subtype, 296 genes significantly differentially expressed in leiomyomas of the FH subtype, and 198 genes as significantly differentially expressed in leiomyomas of the COL4A5-COL4A6 subtype (q <0.05; –2> FC >2) (Fig. S1 and Dataset S2). Differential expression analysis was not performed with the quadruple-negative leiomyomas, owing to the high transcriptional heterogeneity revealed by the clustering analysis.  Fig. S1. Fig. S1. Venn diagram illustrating the number of shared and uniquely differentially expressed genes (q <0.05; –2> FC >2) among leiomyomas of the HMGA2, MED12, FH, and COL4A5-COL4A6 subtypes. Leiomyomas of the MED12 and HMGA2 subtypes ... Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was performed with each of the five gene lists obtained from the differential expression analyses (Dataset S3). The most significant pathways among the different subgroups are compared in Table S1. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway was among the most significantly dysregulated pathways in the complete set of leiomyomas, and was predicted to be inhibited according to IPA. In addition, the Wnt antagonists Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) and secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) (21) were significantly up-regulated in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 and MED12 subtypes, respectively (Dataset S2 and Fig. S2).

(A) Leiomyomas of the HMGA2 subtype displayed a significant up-regulation of the Wnt inhibitor WIF1 (FC = 4.7). (B) Leiomyomas of the MED12 subtype displayed ... IPA also revealed a significant activation of prolactin signaling in leiomyomas. Indeed, prolactin (PRL) was one the most up-regulated genes in the complete set of leiomyomas (FC = 3.0; Dataset S2), and was significantly up-regulated in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 (FC = 7.6), MED12 (FC = 2.6), and COL4A5-COL4A6 (FC = 9.9) subtypes (Dataset S2 and Fig. S3A). Prolactin-releasing hormone receptor (PRLHR) was also one the most up-regulated genes in the complete set (FC = 3.0; Dataset S2), and was significantly up-regulated in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 (FC = 2.7) and MED12 (FC = 9.0) subtypes (Dataset S2 and Fig. S3B).  Fig. S3. Fig. S3. mRNA expression of PRL and PRLHR in different uterine leiomyoma subtypes. (A) PRL was significantly up-regulated in three subtypes (HMGA2, MED12, and COL4A5-COL4A6), and particularly high expression was seen in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 (FC = 7.6) and ... Uniquely Expressed Genes in Different Leiomyoma Subtypes. To identify the most uniquely expressed genes for each leiomyoma subtype, we compared each subtype against the other leiomyomas and myometrium samples (Dataset S4). These genes represent candidate biomarkers of the different leiomyoma subtypes. The 20 most uniquely expressed (q <0.05; –2> FC >2) protein-coding genes for each subtype are presented in Table 1. Below we highlight some of these genes and their association with significantly dysregulated pathways.  Table 1. Table 1. The 20 most uniquely expressed genes in each respective leiomyoma subtype Uniquely Expressed Genes in Leiomyomas of the HMGA2 Subtype. We identified HMGA2 itself as the most uniquely expressed gene (FC = 10.3) in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 subtype (Table 1 and Fig. 2B). Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2), one of the few genes previously proven to be directly regulated by HMGA2 (22), was the second-most significant gene (FC = 4.4; Fig. S4A). The proto-oncogene pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) also was among the most uniquely expressed genes (FC = 8.2; Fig. S4B). Up-regulation (FC = 5.7) of PLAG1 also was seen in three leiomyomas found to harbor an HMGA1 alteration (Dataset S2). Only 2 out of 34 leiomyomas of the MED12 subtype exhibited up-regulation of PLAG1 (FC >2), and one of these harbored an HMGA1 alteration (My5008 m3; FC = 2.6). The other tumor (My16 m1; FC = 17.5) was identified to harbor a balanced translocation, t(6, 8)(q13;q12), with breakpoints located ∼2.3 kbp downstream of PLAG1 and ∼21.9 kbp downstream of COL12A1 (Dataset S5). Further examination revealed up-regulation of PLAG1 in two quadruple-negative leiomyomas (My5007 m2; FC = 11.3 and M51 m1; FC = 7.5) harboring a whole chromosome 8 duplication (Dataset S6). Leiomyomas with a genetic PLAG1 alteration also displayed similar expression patterns as seen in leiomyomas with HMGA2 or HMGA1 alterations (Fig. 1). One of these (My5007 m2) also clustered with leiomyomas of the HMGA2 subtype.  Fig. S4. Fig. S4. mRNA overexpression of IGF2BP2, PLAG1, and IGF2 in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 subtype. (A) Statistical analysis identified IGF2BP2 as the second-most uniquely expressed gene (FC = 4.4) in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 subtype (blue dots). (B) The proto-oncogene ... Insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) has previously been shown to be directly regulated by PLAG1 (23–25), and we detected a significant up-regulation of IGF2 in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 (FC = 3.0) and MED12 (FC = 3.1) subtypes (Dataset S2 and Fig. S4C). A significant up-regulation (FC = 4.3) of IGF2 was detected in the leiomyomas with a genetic PLAG1 alteration as well (Dataset S2 and Fig. S4C). Leiomyomas of the HMGA2 subtype also displayed a unique up-regulation of pappalysin 2 (PAPPA2) (FC = 7.1; Fig. S5A), a gene encoding for an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5) protease (26). Interestingly, we found one quadruple-negative leiomyoma harboring a fusion gene joining exon 1 of IGFBP5 to exon 11 of platelet-derived growth factor receptor, beta polypeptide (PDGFRB) (Dataset S5 and Fig. S6).  Fig. S5. Fig. S5. mRNA expression of the PAPPA2 and ADAM12 in different uterine leiomyoma subtypes. (A) Leiomyomas of the HMGA2 subtype displayed a significant up-regulation of the PAPPA2 (FC = 7.9).

The breakpoints were located in intron 1 of IGFBP5 and in intron 10 of PDGFRB ... Uniquely Expressed Genes in Leiomyomas of the MED12 Subtype. We identified RAD51 paralog B (RAD51B) as the most uniquely expressed gene (FC = 3.8) in leiomyomas of the MED12 subtype (Table 1 and Fig. 2C). Exon-level analysis, confirmed by RNA sequencing, revealed that the up-regulation originated predominantly from a noncoding transcript of RAD51B (ENST00000492236; Fig. 2D and Fig. S7). Of note, expression of this noncoding transcript also was seen at lower levels in the corresponding myometrium samples. We also detected a unique up-regulation of ADAM metallopeptidase domain 12 (ADAM12) (FC = 8.8; Fig. S5B), another IGFBP-5 protease (27).  Fig. S7. Fig. S7. RNA sequencing validation of the up-regulated noncoding transcript of RAD51B in leiomyomas of the MED12 subtype. Illustrated are read alignments at the RAD51B locus in two pooled MED12 mutant samples (MY18 m1 and MY23 m1). Protein-coding transcripts are ... Uniquely Expressed Genes in Leiomyomas of the FH Subtype. We identified aldo-keto reductase family 1, member B10 (aldose reductase) (AKR1B10) as the most uniquely expressed gene (FC = 27.0) in leiomyomas of the FH subtype (Table 1). Expression of AKR1B10 was not seen in any of the other leiomyoma or myometrium samples (Fig. 2E). The NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response was the most significantly dysregulated pathway in leiomyomas of the FH subtype (Table S1). Furthermore, 8 of the 20 most uniquely expressed genes (AKR1B10, TKT, PIR, SLC7A11, NQO1, SRXN1, SLC6A6, and GCLM) have previously been reported as targets of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) (28–31). The pentose phosphate pathway was the only other statistically significant pathway, and three (TKT, PGD, and G6PD) of the 20 most uniquely expressed genes encode for key enzymes of this pathway. None of the other leiomyoma subtypes displayed dysregulation of these two pathways (Table S1).  Uniquely Expressed Genes in Leiomyomas of the COL4A5-COL4A6 Subtype. Although COL4A5 and COL4A6 are both affected by the characteristic COL4A5-COL4A6 deletions, only COL4A5 displayed a statistically significant down-regulation compared with the myometrium (FC = –3.3; Dataset S2). However, we identified insulin receptor substrate-4 (IRS4), a gene located adjacent to COL4A5, as the most uniquely expressed gene in these leiomyomas (FC = 10.5; Table 1 and Fig. 2F). No pathway reached statistical significance (Table S1).  Identification of Down-Regulated Genes Within Commonly Deleted Regions on Chromosomes 7q22, 22q, and 1p. To identify genes most significantly down-regulated by chromosome 7q22, 22q, and 1p deletions, we compared leiomyomas harboring these deletions against leiomyomas and myometrium tissue specimens lacking these aberrations. A total of 14 leiomyomas harbored a deletion spanning 7q22 (Fig. S8). In addition, two leiomyomas harbored chromosomal rearrangements affecting cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1) on 7q22 (Dataset S5 and Fig. S8). A total of 20 leiomyomas harbored a 22q deletion, including 5 leiomyomas harboring a “second hit” truncating mutation affecting DEP domain containing 5 (DEPDC5) (Fig. S9 and Dataset S1). We identified one additional leiomyoma (MY23 m4) harboring a chromosomal rearrangement with breakpoints located ∼14 kbp upstream of DEPDC5 (Dataset S5). Another minimally deleted region was identified on 22q, and one leiomyoma (M9 m3) harbored an additional rearrangement within this region, resulting in a second hit loss of the SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily b, member 1 (SMARCB1) gene (Fig. S9 and Dataset S5). A total of 18 leiomyomas harbored a 1p deletion, and the minimally deleted region contained only one protein-coding gene, nephronophthisis 4 (NPHP4) (Fig. S10). Table 2 presents the 10 most significantly down-regulated protein-coding genes (q <0.05) within commonly deleted regions, and the number times that each gene was affected by a deletion.  Table 2.

This research was approved by the Ethics Review Board of Helsinki University Hospital. All samples were collected in accordance with Finnish laws and regulations with permission from the director of the health care unit. The study materials were derived from five different tissue collections (3–5), one consisting of anonymous patients and the other four consisting of patients who provided signed informed consent before entering the study.  DNA, RNA, and cDNA Sample Preparation. DNA was extracted from fresh-frozen tissue specimens using the FastDNA Kit (MP Biomedicals). Quality and quantity of the extracted DNA were measured using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted using either TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) or Tri Reagent RT (Molecular Research Center) and purified with the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen). The concentration and purity of the extracted RNA were assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Extracted RNA was converted to cDNA according to standard procedures.  Sample Selection and Mutational Screening of Driver Mutations. A total of 94 leiomyoma and 60 corresponding myometrium samples were investigated in this study (Dataset S1). The dataset was selected to include all 38 leiomyomas previously characterized by WGS, 10 leiomyomas previously identified to harbor biallelic loss of FH, and 5 leiomyomas previously identified to harbor a second hit DEPDC5 point mutation (2, 3). The dataset was also selected to include leiomyomas previously identified to harbor deletions on chromosome 22q. WGS data were available for 63 leiomyoma samples and 31 corresponding myometrium samples. SNP array data were available for 50 leiomyoma samples and 36 corresponding myometrium samples. All leiomyomas were screened for MED12 exons 1 and 2 mutations using Sanger sequencing with primers as reported previously (3). All samples were screened for rearrangements and deletions affecting HMGA2, HMGA1, and COL4A5-COL4A6 using WGS and/or SNP arrays. WGS data were not available for 31 leiomyomas, 6 of which were classified as HMGA2 subtype leiomyomas owing to their high level (FC >4) of HMGA2 expression compared with their respective myometrium samples (Dataset S1). All samples were also screened for 7q22, 22q, and 1p deletions and for rearrangements located within the minimally deleted regions of these.  In addition to known driver changes, we identified one leiomyoma harboring a complex chromosomal rearrangement affecting intron 1 of IGFBP5 and intron 10 of PDGFRB (Dataset S5). This rearrangement was validated using primers 5′-TAGGGAGTCCTGTCCCACCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCCTTTCCTAACTCACACCT-3′ (reverse). An in-frame fusion gene joining exon 1 of IGFBP5 to exon 11 of PDGFRB was validated using the cDNA primers 5′-GAGAAAGCCCTCTCCATGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTCTGCCAAAGCATGATGA-3′ (reverse). The oligonucleotide primers were designed using the Primer 3 program (bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/primer3/). One leiomyoma was found to harbor a balanced translocation t (6, 8)(q13; q12) resulting in PLAG1 overexpression (Dataset S5). All leiomyomas were explored for additional genomic alterations affecting PLAG1, and two quadruple-negative leiomyomas were identified to harbor a whole chromosome 8 duplication (Dataset S6). Dataset S1 provides the mutational status of each respective lesion examined in this study.  WGS and SNP Array Preparation. The WGS samples were prepared, sequenced, and aligned as described previously (4), with the exception of one tumor–normal pair (M21) that was aligned following other procedures as described previously (58). In short, a total of 37 leiomyomas and their corresponding 20 myometrium tissue specimens were prepared and sequenced according to the Illumina paired-end WGS, a total of 26 leiomyomas and their corresponding 25 myometrium tissue specimens were prepared and sequenced according to Complete Genomics paired-end WGS protocol, and a total of 50 leiomyomas and their corresponding 36 myometrium tissue specimens were prepared and analyzed using Illumina HumanOmni2.5-8 BeadChip version 1.1 or 1.2. SNP array sample preparation and hybridization were was performed at the Estonian Genome Center, University of Tartu (Tartu, Estonia) or Illumina (San Diego, CA).  Detection of Somatic Copy Number Alterations Using WGS and SNP Arrays. Genome-wide SCNAs were detected from complete genomics WGS data as described previously (4). Both the SNP array data and the Illumina WGS data were analyzed for SCNAs using Partek Genomic Suite version 6.5. Raw somatic copy number calls were constructed from Illumina WGS BAM files using VarScan2 with the following parameters: min-coverage; 10; min-coverage-tumor, 10; min-segment-size, 500; max-segment-size, 500. Each sample was then normalized by subtracting against the median of its raw log2ratio calls. The SNP arrays were preprocessed using Illumina Genome Studio version 2011.1 with default parameters. The SNP array dataset included a few technical replicates that were averaged. Raw somatic copy number calls were constructed, log2-transformed, and smoothed using Partek Genomic Suite version 6.5. Both the SNP array and the WGS copy number calls were corrected for GC waves using Partek Genomic Suite version 6.5.  To identify regions of SCNAs, Partek’s segmentation algorithm was performed using a minimum of 500 markers, a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.5, and a segmentation P value of 0.0001. Segments <−0.2 (deletions) and >0.2 (duplications) were reported. All segments were visually inspected (by log2 ratio plots), and segments identified as technical artifacts were manually filtered out. The segmentation algorithm was also performed with a minimum of 100 markers to detect two smaller deletions located upstream of HMGA1 in sample MY5008 m3 and within COL4A5-COL4A6 in sample M21 m1. A final list of segments affecting selected regions is presented in Dataset S6.  Detection of Genomic Rearrangements Using WGS. Genomic rearrangements were detected from Illumina and Complete Genomics WGS data as described previously (4). In short, genomic rearrangements were detected from Illumina BAM files using BreakDancer version 1.2. Rearrangements were called with stricter parameters in the tumor (−q 65 −r 4) than in the normal myometrium samples (−q 1 −r 1 −y 1). Tumor calls (BreakDancer and Complete Genomics calls) were filtered against a myometrium control set consisting of Illumina BreakDancer calls (n = 25) and Complete Genomics structural variation calls (n = 26). All genomes were examined for breakpoints located within or at a maximum of 400,000 bp upstream/downstream of the canonical transcripts (Ensembl v68) of HMGA2, HMGA1, COL4A5-COL4A6, PLAG1, IGFBP5, and PDGFRB. One leiomyoma (M30 m1) exhibited an HMGA2-RAD51B rearrangement that was clearly detectable through the SCNA analysis, but detectable with BreakDancer only by lowering the parameters to (−q 40 −r 2). Of note, the same leiomyoma (M30 m1) exhibited a rearrangement affecting the COL4A5 locus; however, this rearrangement did not result in the characteristic COL4A5-COL4A6 deletion. All genomes were also examined for rearrangements located within the minimally deleted regions of chromosome 7q22, 22q, and 1p deletions. A final list of genomic rearrangements affecting selected regions is provided in Dataset S5.  Gene Expression Analysis Using Microarrays and RNA Sequencing. Gene expression data were constructed using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays using remapped Brainarray Custom CDF files (HuEx10stv2_Hs_ENSG, version 16). All arrays were hybridized and assessed for quality by the Biomedicum Functional Genomics Unit using the instructions provided by Affymetrix. Analysis of gene expression data were performed with Partek Genomic Suite version 6.5. The samples were quantile-normalized by the robust multichip average method and adjusted for probe sequence and GC content. The datasets were prepared in five different batches, and Partek’s batch effect removal algorithm was used to remove technical noise. The dataset included a few technical replicates that were averaged. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis (cosine correlation) was performed using the 1% most variable genes (n = 372), as defined by the coefficient of variation calculated across all tumor samples.  A two-way ANOVA (paired t test) was constructed to identify genes that were differentially expressed in all leiomyomas compared with the corresponding myometrium samples. A one-way ANOVA was constructed to identify genes that were differentially expressed between each leiomyoma subtype (HMGA2, MED12, FH, and COL4A5-COL4A6) and the myometrium samples. FDR control (Benjamini and Hochberg method) was used to correct for multiple testing. Genes with an FDR <0.05 and a twofold change were considered significant. Pathway enrichment analysis was carried out with differentially expressed genes using Qiagen’s IPA software.  To identify the most uniquely expressed genes for each leiomyoma subtype, a two-way paired ANOVA was constructed that compared each subtype against the rest of the leiomyoma and myometrium samples. These genes have a subtype-specific expression level that differs from both the other leiomyoma and myometrium samples. Exon-level analysis of gene expression data were performed with default parameters using Affymetrix-provided annotations (v35 and hg19).  To identify the genes most significantly down-regulated by chromosome 7q22, 22q, and 1p deletions, a two-way ANOVA (paired) was constructed that compared leiomyomas harboring these aberrations against the rest of the leiomyoma and myometrium samples. FDR control (Benjamini and Hochberg method) was used to correct for multiple testing.  RNA sequencing was performed to validate up-regulation of the noncoding transcript of RAD51B in two leiomyomas (MY18 m1 and MY23 m1) of the MED12 subtype. RNA-seq libraries were prepared from rRNA-depleted (RiboMinus Transcriptome Isolation Kit; Life Technologies) samples using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit A as instructed by the manufacturer. The quality of the data were assessed using FastQC version 0.10. The RNA sequencing data were mapped to the human reference genome GRCh37 with TopHat version 1.4.1 (59).  Go to: DISCUSSION Recent high-throughput sequencing studies have underlined the genetic heterogeneity of leiomyomas (3, 4), suggesting the existence of molecularly distinct subtypes of leiomyomas. In this study, we identified global expression signatures associated with the mutation status of HMGA2, MED12, FH, and COL4A5-COL4A6, supporting the existence of molecularly distinct leiomyoma subtypes. In contrast, deletions of 7q22, 22q, and 1p frequently co-occurred with other genetic changes and had no major influence on the clustering, suggesting that these changes are involved in tumor progression rather than initiation. Leiomyomas with HMGA1 or HMGA2 alterations displayed similar global expression signatures, supporting the idea that these structurally and evolutionarily related transcription factors have similar functions in tumorigenesis (32). The majority of quadruple-negative leiomyomas clustered into several unique branches, indicating the presence of multiple rare and possibly novel subtypes.  Several recent studies have examined a potential role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the development of leiomyomas (7, 19, 33–35). Although our work confirms an aberrant expression of genes related to Wnt/β-catenin signaling, the pathway was unexpectedly predicted to be inhibited. Furthermore, we identified the Wnt pathway antagonists WIF1 and SFRP1 (21) as distinctly up-regulated in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 and MED12 subtypes, respectively. Interestingly, WIF1 is located closely upstream of HMGA2 and transcribed from the opposite strand. WIF1 also is a recurrent translocation partner of HMGA2 in pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary gland (36).  Previous studies have hypothesized that PRL may act as a mitogenic autocrine/paracrine growth factor in human tumorigenesis (37). We identified prolactin signaling as one of the most significantly activated pathways in the complete set of leiomyomas. Furthermore, PRL itself was one of the most highly expressed genes. Interestingly, transgenic mice overexpressing HMGA2 have shown to develop pituitary adenomas secreting prolactin (38), and we detected a particularly high expression of PRL in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 subtype.  The release of prolactin has been shown to be regulated by the prolactin-releasing peptide receptor (PrRPR) (39). We identified a high expression of PRLHR, the gene that encodes for this receptor in leiomyomas of the MED12 subtype. A recent study showed that up-regulation of PrRPR stimulates the proliferation of cultured primary human leiomyoma cells, and that transgenic mice overexpressing PRLHR develop myometrial hyperplasia with excessive extracellular matrix deposition (40).  We identified PLAG1 as one the most uniquely up-regulated genes in leiomyomas with HMGA2 or HMGA1 aberrations. Furthermore, we identified genetic PLAG1 alterations in three leiomyomas, all of which exhibited expression signatures as seen in leiomyomas with HMGA2 or HMGA1 alterations. PLAG1 encodes for a transcription factor whose ectopic expression can trigger the development of several benign mesenchymal tumors (41). Indeed, the overexpression of PLAG1 is typically triggered by chromosomal translocations or, in rarer cases, by amplifications (42). PLAG1 and HMGA2 translocations are both frequent and mutually exclusive in pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary gland (43). RAD51B is the preferential translocation partner of HMGA2 in leiomyomas, and PLAG1 translocations also have been shown to involve the RAD51B loci in lipoblastomas (44). Taken together, these findings indicate that leiomyomas also harbor genetic PLAG1 alterations, and suggest that HMGA2 and HMGA1 promote tumorigenesis through the activation of PLAG1.  Compatible with previous expression profiling studies (14), our pathway analysis revealed a significant dysregulation of IGF1 signaling in leiomyomas. After HMGA2 itself, our statistical analysis identified IGF2BP2 as the second-most uniquely expressed gene in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 subtype. Previous studies have shown that HMGA2 activates the expression of IGF2BP2 by binding to an AT-rich regulatory region within its first intron (22). IGF2BP2 encodes for a protein involved in promoting IGF2 mRNA translation (45). Interestingly, several previous studies have demonstrated that PLAG1 regulates the expression of IGF2 by binding to its P3 promoter (23–25). In support of this, we detected up-regulation of IGF2 in the majority of leiomyomas with an HMGA2, HMGA1, or PLAG1 alteration. IGF2 encodes for insulin-like growth factor 2 and exerts its growth-promoting effect by binding to the IGF1 receptor.  We identified PAPPA2 and ADAM12 as two highly uniquely overexpressed genes in leiomyomas of the HMGA2 and MED12 subtypes, respectively. Both of these genes are expressed at high levels during early placental development and encode for specific proteases of IGFBP-5 (26, 27). Previous studies have shown that IGFBP-5 inhibits IGF1-induced proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells (46). We identified one quadruple-negative leiomyoma as harboring a fusion gene involving IGFBP5 and PDGFRB. Although fusions involving PDGFRB are known to drive hematopoietic cancers (47), the disruption of IGFBP5 may further enhance leiomyoma development. The exact role of IGFBP-5 in leiomyoma development remains to be resolved, given that IGFBP-5 has been found to both promote and inhibit cancer development (48).  We identified IRS4, a gene located adjacent to COL4A5, as the most uniquely expressed gene in leiomyomas of the COL4A5-COL4A6 subtype. IRS4 encodes for the insulin receptor substrate 4, which has been shown to enhance insulin-like growth factor 1–induced cell proliferation (49). Taken together, these observations support a central role for IGF1 signaling in leiomyomas of the HMGA2, MED12, and COL4A5-COL4A6 subtypes.  The mechanism of tumorigenesis caused by FH mutations has remained unclear. The most extensively studied hypothesis is activation of the hypoxia pathway (50). Biallelic loss of FH results is accumulation of intracellular fumarate, which in turn may inhibit the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α), leading to pseudohypoxia through aberrant accumulation of this key protein. More recently, two independent research groups demonstrated that KEAP1, a negative regulator of the oncogenic transcription factor NRF2, becomes succinated by high levels of fumarate, leading to accumulation and activation of NRF2 (30, 51). Activation of NRF2 has recently been identified as a common feature of many cancers (52). In this study, we found that the NRF2 signaling pathway was the single most significantly dysregulated pathway in leiomyomas of the FH subtype, whereas the HIF1α signaling pathway was not significantly altered. We detected AKR1B10, a known target of NRF2 (29), as a highly promising biomarker for FH deficiency. NRF2 activation has previously been shown to redirect glucose and glutamine into anabolic pathways, including the pentose phosphate pathway (31). In support of this, we identified the pentose phosphate pathway as the only other statistically significant pathway.  We previously reported RAD51B to be specifically up-regulated in leiomyomas with MED12 mutations (4). In this study, we discovered that this up-regulation corresponds to a (long) non–protein-coding transcript of RAD51B. Remarkably, RAD51B is also the most common translocation partner of HMGA2 in leiomyomas (4, 53). It is tempting to speculate that this noncoding transcript might have an unresolved tumor-promoting role.  Leiomyomas frequently harbor recurrent deletions affecting 7q22, 22q, and 1p, suggesting that these regions contain tumor suppressor genes (8–11). High-throughput sequencing studies have rarely detected second hit mutations within these regions, however (3, 4, 13), suggesting that the target genes may act in a haploinsufficient manner. Furthermore, these changes are often very complex, consisting of inversions, translocations, and deletions in various regions (4), suggesting that multiple genes are targeted simultaneously. In an effort to identify putative target genes, we explored the transcriptional consequences of genes located within these deletions.  We identified CUX1 as the third-most significantly down-regulated gene of 7q22 deletions. CUX1 is located within the minimally deleted region and has been shown to be disrupted by chromosomal rearrangements (4, 54); however, no point mutations have been found, and some 7q22 deletions do not span CUX1 (55). Only one of our samples harbored a biallelic loss of CUX1, suggesting that CUX1 is a haploinsufficent tumor suppressor. Indeed, CUX1 was recently shown to have such a role in acute myeloid leukemia (56).  This study included five leiomyomas previously detected to harbor truncating DEPDC5 point mutations, indicating that DEPDC5 is a target gene on 22q (4). Compatible with this notion, our expression analysis identified DEPDC5 as the third-most significantly down-regulated gene of 22q deletions. Interestingly, we identified another commonly deleted region on chromosome 22q. One leiomyoma harbored an additional chromosomal rearrangement within this region, resulting in biallelic loss of the tumor suppressor SMARCB1. SMARCB1 is of special interest because a germline mutation in SMARCB1, typically causing schwannomatosis, was recently associated with the development of leiomyomas as well (57).  Deletions of 1p have been associated with distinct histopathological features and possible malignant progression of leiomyomas (11, 16). Interestingly, we identified NPHP4 as the most commonly deleted gene on chromosome 1p. NPHP4 has previously been highlighted as a putative target gene in leiomyomas, owing to recurrent translocation breakpoints located upstream of the NPHP4 locus (10); however, we did not detect a significant down-regulation of NPHP4 in leiomyomas with 1p deletions.  Go to: CONCLUSIONS It is well known that uterine leiomyomas display significant heterogeneity in terms of symptoms, histopathology, therapeutic requirements, and genetic changes (2). The evidence presented in this study strongly suggests that specific driver mutations are the major determinants of expression changes in leiomyomas. The variability and inconsistencies frequently seen among samples and studies may be largely explained by different genetic factors driving the lesions. Here we highlight subtype-specific expression changes in key driver pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, prolactin, IGF1, and NRF2 signaling (Fig. 3). Transcriptional differences in key driver genes and pathways also may explain the frequently seen differences in clinicopathological outcomes. The evidence presented in this study highlight the need for molecular stratification in uterine leiomyoma research, and possibly in clinical practice. This study offers a set of candidate biomarkers that will facilitate the classification of uterine leiomyomas in both contexts.  Fig. 3. Fig. 3.

The research was approved by the Ethics Review Board of Helsinki University Hospital. A total of 94 leiomyomas and 60 corresponding myometrium tissue specimens were investigated (Dataset S1). All tissue specimens were collected during hysterectomies and stored as fresh-frozen. The samples were derived from five tissue collections, one consisting of anonymous patients and the other four of patients who signed an informed consent before entering the study.  All leiomyomas were screened for MED12 exon 1 and 2 mutations using Sanger sequencing with primers as reported previously (3). All specimens were screened for rearrangements and deletions affecting HMGA2, HMGA1, and COL4A5-COL4A6 using WGS and/or SNP arrays. All specimens were also screened for 7q22, 22q, and 1p deletions, as well as for rearrangements located within the minimally deleted regions of these. Dataset S1 presents the mutational status of each lesion examined in this study.  WGS data were available for 63 leiomyomas and 31 corresponding myometrium tissue specimens. Genomic DNA libraries were prepared and sequenced according to Illumina and Complete Genomics paired-end sequencing service protocols. A total of 50 leiomyomas and 36 corresponding myometrium tissue specimens were prepared and analyzed using Illumina HumanOmni2.5-8 BeadChips version 1.1 or 1.2. Genome-wide somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) were detected from Complete Genomics WGS as described previously (4). Both the SNP array data and the Illumina WGS data were analyzed for SCNAs using Partek Genomics Suite version 6.5. Genomic rearrangements were detected from Illumina and Complete Genomics WGS data as described previously (4). In short, genomic rearrangements were detected from Illumina BAM files using BreakDancer version 1.2.  Gene expression data were constructed using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays. Differential expression analyses were performed with Partek Genomics Suite version 6.5. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis (cosine correlation) was performed using 1% most variable genes (n = 372), defined by the coefficient of variation calculated across all tumor samples. Pathway enrichment analysis was carried out with differentially expressed genes using Qiagen’s IPA software. False discovery rate (FDR) control (Benjamini and Hochberg method) was used to correct for multiple testing. RNA sequencing libraries were prepared from rRNA-depleted (RiboMinus Transcriptome Isolation Kit; Life Technologies) samples using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit A in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Abstract HMGIC, a high-mobility-group protein gene encoding an architectural transcription factor, was recently identified as the target of gene fusion in a variety of human benign mesenchymal tumors; some of these events were chromosomal translocations involving 12q13–15. HMGIC consists of three DNA-binding domains (encoded by exons 1–3), a spacer, and an acidic carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain (exons 4–5). To determine the spectrum and nature of the aberrations in uterine myomas in Japanese patients, we systematically examined the tumors of 45 patients for all possible types of gene fusions involving HMGIC, by means of 39-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments. HMGIC gene fusions were found in 16 (36%) of the tumors; aberrant splicings to five cryptic sequences located in introns of the HMGIC gene were found in 11 of these cases, and translocations causing juxtaposition to other genes, such as COX6C and RAD51B, were found in 5. In all fusion transcripts, the first two or three exons of HMGIC were fused to ectopic sequences. Our results suggest that a fusion event, resulting in the separation of the DNA-binding domains of HMGIC from the spacer and the acidic carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain, is a common tumorigenic mechanism in the development of uterine myomas. Key words HMGIC • Uterine leiomyoma • Rearrangement • Aberrant splicing Introduction Uterine leiomyomas are among the most frequent benign smooth-muscle tumors in women of reproductive age. Cytogenetic studies have revealed a close association between these tumors and specific aberrations, especially those involving chromosome 12q15 (Sandors et al. 1990; Sreeckantaiah et al. 1991; Dal Cin et al. 1993). Recent advances in molecular genetics have yielded further insight, in that these cytogenetic changes occur mostly within a region encoding HMGIC, a member of the HMG (high-mobilitygroup) family of proteins, and usually involve rearrangements of the HMGIC gene itself (Ashar et al. 1995; Schoenmakers et al. 1995). Two molecular mechanisms underlying such rearrangements have been identified in benign tumors; one is intragenic translocation involving HMGIC and a fusion partner, with the formation of a chimeric gene. The other is aberrant splicing that yields variant products (Ashar et al. 1996; Tallini and Dal Cin 1999). HMG proteins are nonhistone, chromatin-associated molecules, known as “architectural elements,” whose selective binding to specific structural conformations of DNA leads to replication, transcription, and repair (Chau et al. 1995; Ashar et al. 1996). The expression of HMGIC is developmentally regulated, and is generally not observed in normal adult tissues (Manfioletti et al. 1991; Hirning-Holz et al. 1998), but the gene is frequently expressed in transformed malignant cells and in some human cancers (Lund et al. 1983). Because HMGIC protein is presumed to function as a transcription factor, the gene could play some role in transformation and carcinogenesis (Tallini and Dal Cin 1999). Although many reports describe relationships between 12q15 chromosomal aberrations and benign mesenchymal tumors, the prevalence of HMGIC rearrangements in such tumors is unknown. To determine the prevalence and the spectrum of HMGIC rearrangements in Japanese women with uterine leiomyomas, we systematically examined 45 patients for all possible types of gene-fusion events involving HMGIC, by means of experiments involving 39-rapid B. Jochimsen et al.: Stetteria hydrogenophila 409 amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR), radiation-hybrid mapping, and DNA cloning and sequencing. Materials and methods Tumor samples and RNA extraction. Uterine leiomyomas were obtained from 45 patients at the time of surgery at the Nippon Medical School Hospital. The tumors were frozen immediately, and stored at 270°C until use. From approximately 100mg of each leiomyoma tissue, total RNA was extracted by the guanidine thiocyanate method (Chomczynski and Sacchi 1987), using an Isogen RNA extraction kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). PCR primers and hybridization probes. Sequences of all oligonucleotide primers used in the experiments (AP1, AP2, H1-H3, and hybridization probe “A”) were reported previously (Kurose et al. 2000). 39 Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (39RACE). To screen for HMGIC fusion genes, 5mg of each sample of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with superscript II (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA) for 50min at 42°C, in a 40-µl reaction mixture containing 50mM Tris-HCl (ph 8.3), 75mM KCl, 3mM MgCl2, 10mM DTT, 0.5mM dNTP, and 50pmol of adapter primer (AP1). The RNA was then digested with 6U of RnaseH (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) at 37°C for 30min. For the first, second, and third rounds of PCR we used adapter primer 2 (AP2) as the reverse primer. As the forward primers, in the first round we used HMGIC-specific primer H1 (HMGIC exon 1); in the second round, nested primer H2 (HMGIC exons 1 and 2); and in the third round, nested primer H3 (HMGIC exon 2; see Fig. 1A). Firststrand cDNA was the template for first-round PCRs, which took place in total volumes of 10µl, containing 1X KlenTaq PCR reaction buffer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), 0.2mM of each dNTP, 4pmol of each primer, and 1X Advantage KlenTaq Polymerase Mix (Clontech). Cycle conditions were 94°C for 2min, then 30 cycles of 94°C for 10s, 60°C for 30s, and 68°C for 4min, in a Gene Amp PCR 9600 System (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Foster City, CA, USA). In the second- and third-round PCRs, a 1/50 portion of each PCR product was used as template for the nested PCR. Nested PCR conditions were as described above, except that the DNA was amplified for 25 cycles. Oligonucleotide hybridization. Nested PCR products from the 39 RACE experiments were electrophoresed on 3% NuSieve agarose gels (FMC, Rockland, ME, USA) and transferred to nylon membranes. An HMGIC gene-specific oligonucleotide probe A (Fig. 1A; exon 2) was end-labeled with [γ- 32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and hybridized to blotted membranes, according to a procedure we described previously (Tsukamoto et al. 1998). Cloning and sequencing of fusion transcripts. To characterize the structure of the HMGIC fusion transcripts, the 39 RACE products positive for hybridization were subcloned into the plasmid vector pBlueScript II (SK1) and sequenced on a 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Results We first examined RNAs from the 45 uterine leiomyomas by 39 RACE experiments, using HMGIC cDNA sequences as primers (Fig. 1A). We found that 16 of the tumors had HMGIC probe-positive bands of unexpected molecular size (Fig. 1B). To identify the nature of these bands, we extracted the relevant PCR products from the gels for cloning and sequencing. Sequence data indicated that all of the aberrant bands contained partial, but not the whole, Fig. 1.

B Representative autoradiograms from 39 RACE examination of uterine leiomyomas. The 39 RACE products of all three tumor cDNAs shown here hybridized to the HMGIC-specific probe 410 N. Matsuda et al.: EGF receptor and osteoblastic differentiation HMGIC sequence, and other sequences as well. These findings supported previous indications that chimeric HGMIC-containing sequences can originate from rearrangements in which truncated HMGIC is fused with ectopic sequences. The results of RT-PCR analysis, demonstrated in Fig. 1B, clearly show that each aberrant fused transcript was the one and only, major component of the HMGIC-related transcript detected in each tumor in multiple instances. Rearrangements of the HMGIC gene mostly occur within the huge intron 3, which spans over 100kb in size. Any rearrangements that occur within this vast region could not be detected by regular Southern blotting or genomic PCR, using HMGIC exonic sequences, because the rearranged structures are out of the size range of detection by these methods. Cytological analysis depends on successful chromosome preparation after the establishment of a primary culture from each solid tumors, however, the establishment of a primary culture is usually unsuccessful in uterine leiomyoma. A BLAST search involving all 16 aberrant genes showed that the ectopic sequences in 11 of them (cases 4, 6, 7, 10, 13, 24, 37, 38, 40, 42, and 44) had been reported already in other HMGIC rearrangements. The other 5 (cases 8, 11, 12, 39, and 47) contained previously unknown sequences. Sequencing data showed that four of these (in cases 8, 11, 12, and 39) were the result of novel aberrant splicing (Kurose et al. 2001). In the remaining tumor (in case 47), a novel type of HMGIC rearrangement was identified in the 39 RACE product. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of this novel fusion 39 RACE product is shown in Fig. 2. In this tumor, the 39 novel sequence 59- GTACATCAGGAACGTCTCTAT-39 was fused in-frame to the HMGIC amino acid sequence starting from exon 2 of the HMGIC gene. We recently identified this novel ectopic fusion sequence to be the HEI10 (homo sapiens enhancer of invasion 10) gene as a translocation partner of HMGIC (Mine et al. 2001). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the aberrant sequences identified here. All the rearrangements we observed could be assigned to one of two groups on the basis of their underlying mechanisms; i.e., translocation with formation of chimeric genes (5 cases), or aberrant splicing (11 cases). With regard to their breakpoints, the rearrangements could be divided into three groups: group 1, breakpoint in intron 2 (case 47; 1/16 [6%]); group 2, breakpoint in intron 3 (cases 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 37, 38, and 39; 10/16 [63%]) and group 3, breakpoint in intron 4 (cases 13, 24, 40, 42, and 44; 5/16 [31%]). Discussion Many investigators have observed a close relationship between specific cytogenetic changes, especially those involving 12q13–15 and 6p21, and the development of benign mesenchymal tumors such as leiomyomas, pulmonary chondroid harmatomas, and lipomas. Two HMGI genes, HMGIC and HMGI(Y) are located within 12q15 and 6p21, respectively, and rearrangements have been reported in both genes (Schoenmakers et al. 1995; Tallini and Dal Cin 1999). HMGIC and HMGI(Y) have similar structures, with approximately 50% homology in amino-acid sequence. Neither of these proteins has an HMG box domain, but both bind DNA by means of three separate “AT-rich” motifs (Ashar et al. 1995). HMGI(Y) activates transcription by interacting with the promoter regions of a variety of genes. HMGI proteins, as a class, are believed to be involved in regulating transcription and influencing chromatin structure; they also encode C-terminal acidic domains, which are Fig. 2. Schematic representation of three rearrangements involving HMGIC. The U29117, NM004374, and unknown (case 47) sequences are fused to HMGIC between its DNAbinding domains and the spacer, separating the DNA-binding domains from the spacer and the acidic carboxyl-terminal domain (AD).

Jochimsen et al.: Stetteria hydrogenophila 411 believed to interact with other transcription factors (Chau et al. 1995). On the basis of these observations, we would expect rearrangements of HMGIC and the consequent expression of abnormal proteins to have had some role in the development of the benign tumors that harbor them (Wim and Van de Ven 1998). Some investigators have reported the prevalence of cytogenetic changes believed to be associated with rearrangements of HMGI genes in benign tumors. For example, Sandors et al. (1990) reported a 40% prevalence of 12q13– 15 abnormalities in pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary gland. In uterine leiomyomas and lipomas, reported rates have been 30% and 60%, respectively (Heim et al. 1986; Vanni et al. 1993). In breast fibroadenomas, the frequency reported was 8% (Calabrese et al. 1991). However, none of these studies provided any direct information about the prevalence of aberrations in the HMGI genes themselves. Two kinds of mechanism are known to underlie the aberrations at 12q13 seen in benign tumors, in terms of the translocation and abnormal splicing of the HMGIC gene. To clarify the putative relationship between HMGIC rearrangements and the development of uterine leiomyomas, we attempted to identify the prevalence and the spectrum of HMGIC changes in Japanese patients. To this end, we examined uterine leiomyomas from 45 women, and found an overall prevalence of 36% (16/45). This rate is close to that reported for 12q13–15 abnormalities in cytogenetic studies. Recently, Tallini et al. (2000) reported a relationship between HMGIC immunoreactivity and cytogenetic abnormalities in some benign tumors; in their studies, most of the tumors (85.6%–95%) presenting cytogenetic abnormalities at 12q15 or 6p21 expressed abnormal HMGI proteins. Based on this observation, almost all patients showing 12q15 aberration are likely to have rearrangements of HMGIC. If this were to be true, there would be no difference in the general prevalence between Japanese and Western women. Aberrant splicing occurred about twice as often as translocations in our clinical sample (24% vs 11%). Most of the aberrant splices we observed (7/11; 63.6%) had been reported previously. Five of these seven were the same as U29115, from the human lipoma cell line LM-30.1 (cases 13, 24, 40, 42, and 44) and the other two were identical to U29112, from the human lipoma cell line Li-538 (cases 6 and 38). Of the four novel aberrant splices, two were the same. Because the HMGIC aberrations found in several independent cases have been the same (Schoenmakers et al. 1999; Kurose et al. 2001), we suggest that specific sites or patterns of aberrant splicing are common features of HMGIC rearrangements. Fifteen of the 16 rearrangements we observed in our 45 patients had occurred in intron 3 (10/16) or intron 4 (5/16); the single exception had a breakpoint in intron 2. This means that all rearrangements, except for one, retained all three DNA-binding domains, and the one exception retained two of the three DNA-binding domains; all 16 fusion proteins may, therefore, retain the ability to bind DNA. Our sequence data also showed that all 16 fusion genes had lost the sequence encoding the 39 acidic carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain of HMGIC. With respect to the ectopic genes, their fused sequences were all short, and we saw no common feature among them. On the basis of these findings, we speculate that because the HMGIC domains characteristic of the fusion proteins may confer unregulated DNA-binding capacity, the fusion events may well participate in the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyomas.
